	As by your high imperial majesty
	I had in charge at my depart for France,
	As procurator to your excellence,
	To marry Princess Margaret for your Grace;
	So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
	In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,
	The Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Britaine, and Alençon,
	Seven earls, twelve barons, and twenty reverend bishops,
	I have perform'd my task, and was espous'd:
	And humbly now upon my bended knee,
	In sight of England and her lordly peers,
	Deliver up my title in the queen
	To your most gracious hands, that are the substance
	Of that great shadow I did represent;
	The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,
	The fairest queen that ever king receiv'd.
</SUFFOLK>

<K. HENRY>	<1%>
	Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret:
	I can express no kinder sign of love
	Than this kind kiss. O Lord! that lends me life,
	Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!
	For thou hast given me in this beauteous face
	A world of earthly blessings to my soul,
	If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.
</K. HENRY>

<Q. MARGARET>	<1%>
	Great King of England and my gracious lord,
	The mutual conference that my mind hath had
	By day, by night, waking, and in my dreams,
	In courtly company, or at my beads,
	With you, mine alderliefest sovereign,
	Makes me the bolder to salute my king
	With ruder terms, such as my wit affords,
	And over-joy of heart doth minister.
</Q. MARGARET>

<K. HENRY>	<1%>
	Her sight did ravish, but her grace in speech,
	Her words y-clad with wisdom's majesty,
	Makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys;
	Such is the fulness of my heart's content.
	Lords, with one cheerful voice welcome my love.
</K. HENRY>

	Long live Queen Margaret, England's happiness!

	My Lord Protector, so it please your Grace,
	Here are the articles of contracted peace
	Between our sovereign and the French King Charles,
	For eighteen months concluded by consent.
</SUFFOLK>

<GLOUCESTER>	<2%>
	Imprimis, It is agreed between the French king, Charles, and William De la Pole, Marquess of Suffolk, ambassador for Henry King of England, that the said Henry shall espouse the Lady Margaret, daughter unto Reignier King of Naples, Sicilia, and Jerusalem, and crown her Queen of England ere the thirtieth of May next ensuing. 
	Item, That the duchy of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be released and delivered to the king her father.—

</STAGE DIR>

<K. HENRY>	<2%>
	Uncle, how now!
</K. HENRY>

<GLOUCESTER>	<2%>
	Pardon me, gracious lord;
	Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart
	And dimm'd mine eyes, that I can read no further.
</GLOUCESTER>

<K. HENRY>	<2%>
	Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.
</K. HENRY>

<CARDINAL>	<2%>
	Item, It is further agreed between them, that the duchies of Anjou and Maine shall be released and delivered over to the king her father; and she sent over of the King of England's own proper cost and charges, without having any dowry.
</CARDINAL>

<K. HENRY>	<2%>
	They please us well. Lord marquess, kneel down:
	We here create thee the first Duke of Suffolk,
	And girt thee with the sword. Cousin of York,
	We here discharge your Grace from being regent
	I' the parts of France, till term of eighteen months
	Be full expir'd. Thanks, uncle Winchester,
	Gloucester, York, Buckingham, Somerset,
	Salisbury, and Warwick;
	We thank you all for this great favour done,
	In entertainment to my princely queen.
	Come, let us in, and with all speed provide
	To see her coronation be perform'd.
</K. HENRY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt King, Queen, and Suffolk.>

<GLOUCESTER>	<3%>
	Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,
	To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,
	Your grief, the common grief of all the land.
	What! did my brother Henry spend his youth,
	His valour, coin, and people, in the wars?
	Did he so often lodge in open field,
	In winter's cold, and summer's parching heat,
	To conquer France, his true inheritance?
	And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,
	To keep by policy what Henry got?
	Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,
	Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,
	Receiv'd deep scars in France and Normandy?
	Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,
	With all the learned council of the realm,
	Studied so long, sat in the council-house
	Early and late, debating to and fro
	How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe?
	And hath his highness in his infancy
	Been crown'd in Paris, in despite of foes?
	And shall these labours and these honours die?
	Shall Henry's conquest, Bedford's vigilance,
	Your deeds of war and all our counsel die?
	O peers of England! shameful is this league,
	Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,
	Blotting your names from books of memory,
	Razing the characters of your renown,
	Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,
	Undoing all, as all had never been.
</GLOUCESTER>

<CARDINAL>	<3%>
	Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,
	This peroration with such circumstance?
	For France, 'tis ours; and we will keep it still.
</CARDINAL>

<GLOUCESTER>	<4%>
	Ay, uncle; we will keep it, if we can;
	But now it is impossible we should.
	Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,
	Hath given the duchies of Anjou and Maine
	Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style
	Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.
</GLOUCESTER>

<SALISBURY>	<4%>
	Now, by the death of him who died for all,
	These counties were the keys of Normandy.
	But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?
</SALISBURY>

<WARWICK>	<4%>
	For grief that they are past recovery:
	For, were there hope to conquer them again,
	My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.
	Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both;
	Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer:
	And are the cities, that I got with wounds,
	Deliver'd up again with peaceful words?
	Mort Dieu!
</WARWICK>

<YORK>	<4%>
	For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate,
	That dims the honour of this war-like isle!
	France should have torn and rent my very heart
	Before I would have yielded to this league.
	I never read but England's kings have had
	Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives;
	And our King Henry gives away his own,
	To match with her that brings no vantages.
</YORK>

<GLOUCESTER>	<4%>
	A proper jest, and never heard before,
	That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth
	For costs and charges in transporting her!
	She should have stay'd in France, and starv'd in France,
	Before—
</GLOUCESTER>

<CARDINAL>	<4%>
	My Lord of Gloucester, now you grow too hot:
	It was the pleasure of my lord the king.
</CARDINAL>

<GLOUCESTER>	<4%>
	My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind:
	'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,
	But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye.
	Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face
	I see thy fury. If I longer stay
	We shall begin our ancient bickerings.
	Lordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone,
	I prophesied France will be lost ere long.
</GLOUCESTER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<CARDINAL>	<5%>
	So, there goes our protector in a rage.
	'Tis known to you he is mine enemy,
	Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,
	And no great friend, I fear me, to the king.
	Consider lords, he is the next of blood,
	And heir apparent to the English crown:
	Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,
	And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,
	There's reason he should be displeas'd at it.
	Look to it, lords; let not his smoothing words
	Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.
	What though the common people favour him,
	Calling him, 'Humphrey, the good Duke of Gloucester;'
	Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,
	'Jesu maintain your royal excellence!'
	With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!'
	I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,
	He will be found a dangerous protector.
</CARDINAL>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<5%>
	Why should he then protect our sovereign,
	He being of age to govern of himself?
	Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,
	And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,
	We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<CARDINAL>	<5%>
	This weighty business will not brook delay;
	I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.
</CARDINAL>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<SOMERSET>	<5%>
	Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey's pride
	And greatness of his place be grief to us,
	Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal:
	His insolence is more intolerable
	Than all the princes in the land beside:
	If Gloucester be displac'd, he'll be protector.
</SOMERSET>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<6%>
	Or thou, or I, Somerset, will be protector,
	Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal.
</BUCKINGHAM>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Buckingham and Somerset.>
</STAGE DIR>

<SALISBURY>	<6%>
	Pride went before, ambition follows him.
	While these do labour for their own preferment,
	Behoves it us to labour for the realm.
	I never saw but Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester,
	Did bear him like a noble gentleman.
	Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal
	More like a soldier than a man o' the church,
	As stout and proud as he were lord of all,
	Swear like a ruffian and demean himself
	Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.
	Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age,
	Thy deeds, thy plainness, and thy house-keeping,
	Have won the greatest favour of the commons,
	Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey:
	And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,
	In bringing them to civil discipline,
	Thy late exploits done in the heart of France,
	When thou wert regent for our sovereign,
	Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people.
	Join we together for the public good,
	In what we can to bridle and suppress
	The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal,
	With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition;
	And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds,
	While they do tend the profit of the land.
</SALISBURY>

<WARWICK>	<6%>
	So God help Warwick, as he loves the land,
	And common profit of his country!

<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> And so says York, for he hath greatest cause.
</YORK>

<SALISBURY>	<6%>
	Then let's make haste away, and look unto the main.
</SALISBURY>

<WARWICK>	<7%>
	Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost!
	That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,
	And would have kept so long as breath did last:
	Main chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine,
	Which I will win from France, or else be slain.
</WARWICK>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Warwick and Salisbury.>
</STAGE DIR>

<YORK>	<7%>
	Anjou and Maine are given to the French;
	Paris is lost; the state of Normandy
	Stands on a tickle point now they are gone.
	Suffolk concluded on the articles,
	The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleas'd
	To change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.
	I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?
	'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.
	Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage,
	And purchase friends, and give to courtezans,
	Still revelling like lords till all be gone;
	While as the silly owner of the goods
	Weeps over them, and wrings his hapless hands,
	And shakes his head, and trembling stands aloof,
	While all is shar'd and all is borne away,
	Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:
	So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue
	While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.
	Methinks the realms of England, France, and Ireland
	Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
	As did the fatal brand Althæa burn'd
	Unto the prince's heart of Calydon.
	Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!
	Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,
	Even as I have of fertile England's soil.
	A day will come when York shall claim his own;
	And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts
	And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,
	And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,
	For that's the golden mark I seek to hit.
	Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right.
	Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
	Nor wear the diadem upon his head,
	Whose church-like humours fit not for a crown.
	Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:
	Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,
	To pry into the secrets of the state;
	Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,
	With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,
	And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:
	Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,
	With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfum'd,
	And in my standard bear the arms of York,
	To grapple with the house of Lancaster;
	And, force perforce, I'll make him yield the crown,
	Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.

	Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows,
	As frowning at the favours of the world?
	Why are thine eyes fix'd to the sullen earth,
	Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?
	What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem
	Enchas'd with all the honours of the world?
	If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,
	Until thy head be circled with the same.
	Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold:
	What! is't too short? I'll lengthen it with mine;
	And having both together heav'd it up,
	We'll both together lift our heads to heaven,
	And never more abase our sight so low

	O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,
	Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts:

	My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.

</DUCHESS>

<GLOUCESTER>	<9%>
	Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court,
	Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot,
	But, as I think, it was by the cardinal;
	And on the pieces of the broken wand
	Were plac'd the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset,
	And William De la Pole, first Duke of Suffolk.
	This was my dream: what it doth bode, God knows.

<DUCHESS>	<9%>
	Tut! this was nothing but an argument
	That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove
	Shall lose his head for his presumption.
	But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke:
	Methought I sat in seat of majesty
	In the cathedral church of Westminster,
	And in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd;
	Where Henry and Dame Margaret kneel'd to me,
	And on my head did set the diadem.
</DUCHESS>

<GLOUCESTER>	<9%>
	Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright:
	Presumptuous dame! ill-nurtur'd Eleanor!
	Art thou not second woman in the realm,
	And the protector's wife, belov'd of him?
	Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,
	Above the reach or compass of thy thought?
	And wilt thou still be hammering treachery,
	To tumble down thy husband and thyself
	From top of honour to disgrace's feet?
	Away from me, and let me hear no more.
</GLOUCESTER>

<DUCHESS>	<10%>
	What, what, my lord! are you so choleric

	Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood,

	And, being a woman, I will not be slack

	Hume must make merry with the duchess' gold;
	Marry and shall. But how now, Sir John Hume!
	Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:
	The business asketh silent secrecy.
	Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:
	Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil.
	Yet have I gold flies from another coast:
	I dare not say from the rich cardinal
	And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk;
	Yet I do find it so: for, to be plain,
	They, knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour,
	Have hired me to undermine the duchess
	And buzz these conjurations in her brain.
	They say, 'A crafty knave does need no broker;'
	Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal's broker.
	Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near
	To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.
	Well, so it stands; and thus, I fear, at last
	Hume's knavery will be the duchess' wrack,
	And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall.
	Sort how it will I shall have gold for all.

	My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,
	Is this the fashion of the court of England?
	Is this the government of Britain's isle,
	And this the royalty of Albion's king?
	What! shall King Henry be a pupil still
	Under the surly Gloucester's governance?
	Am I a queen in title and in style,
	And must be made a subject to a duke?
	I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
	Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love,
	And stol'st away the ladies' hearts of France,
	I thought King Henry had resembled thee
	In courage, courtship, and proportion:
	But all his mind is bent to holiness,
	To number Ave-Maries on his beads;
	His champions are the prophets and apostles;
	His weapons holy saws of sacred writ;
	His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves
	Are brazen images of canoniz'd saints.
	I would the college of the cardinals
	Would choose him pope, and carry him to Rome,
	And set the triple crown upon his head:
	That were a state fit for his holiness.

	Madam, be patient; as I was cause
	Your highness came to England, so will I
	In England work your Grace's full content.

<Q. MARGARET>	<13%>
	Beside the haught protector, have we Beaufort
	The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,
	And grumbling York; and not the least of these
	But can do more in England than the king.
</Q. MARGARET>

<SUFFOLK>	<14%>
	And he of these that can do most of all
	Cannot do more in England than the Nevils:
	Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.
</SUFFOLK>

<Q. MARGARET>	<14%>
	Not all these lords do vex me half so much
	As that proud dame, the Lord Protector's wife:
	She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,
	More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife.
	Strangers in court do take her for the queen:
	She bears a duke's revenues on her back,
	And in her heart she scorns our poverty.
	Shall I not live to be aveng'd on her?
	Contemptuous base-born callot as she is,
	She vaunted 'mongst her minions t'other day
	The very train of her worst wearing gown
	Was better worth than all my father's lands,
	Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.
</Q. MARGARET>

<SUFFOLK>	<14%>
	Madam, myself have lim'd a bush for her,
	And plac'd a quire of such enticing birds
	That she will light to listen to the lays,
	And never mount to trouble you again.
	So, let her rest: and, madam, list to me;
	For I am bold to counsel you in this.
	Although we fancy not the cardinal,
	Yet must we join with him and with the lords
	Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.
	As for the Duke of York, this late complaint
	Will make but little for his benefit:
	So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,
	And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.

	Then, Saunder, sit there, the lyingest knave in Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou mightst as well have known all our names as thus to name the several colours we do wear. Sight may distinguish of colours, but suddenly to nominate them all, it is impossible. My lords, Saint Alban here hath done a miracle; and would ye not think that cunning to be great, that could restore this cripple to his legs again?

	A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,
	Under the countenance and confederacy
	Of Lady Eleanor, the protector's wife,
	The ringleader and head of all this rout,
	Have practis'd dangerously against your state,
	Dealing with witches and with conjurers:
	Whom we have apprehended in the fact;
	Raising up wicked spirits from under-ground,
	Demanding of King Henry's life and death,
	And other of your highness' privy council,
	As more at large your Grace shall understand.
</BUCKINGHAM>

	And so, my Lord Protector, by this means

	Noble she is, but if she have forgot
	Honour and virtue, and convers'd with such
	As, like to pitch, defile nobility,
	I banish her my bed and company,

<London. The Duke of York's Garden.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter York, Salisbury, and Warwick.>
</STAGE DIR>
<YORK>	<28%>
	Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,
	Our simple supper ended, give me leave,
	In this close walk to satisfy myself,
	In craving your opinion of my title,
	Which is infallible to England's crown.
</YORK>

<SALISBURY>	<28%>
	My lord, I long to hear it at full.
</SALISBURY>

<WARWICK>	<28%>
	Sweet York, begin; and if thy claim be good,
	The Nevils are thy subjects to command.
</WARWICK>

<YORK>	<29%>
	Then thus:
	Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
	The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;
	The second, William of Hatfield; and the third,
	Lionel, Duke of Clarence; next to whom
	Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;
	The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;
	The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;
	William of Windsor was the seventh and last.
	Edward the Black Prince died before his father,
	And left behind him Richard, his only son,
	Who after Edward the Third's death, reign'd as king;
	Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,
	The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,
	Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,
	Seiz'd on the realm, depos'd the rightful king,
	Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,
	And him to Pomfret; where as all you know,
	Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.
</YORK>

<WARWICK>	<29%>
	Father, the duke hath told the truth;
	Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.
</WARWICK>

<YORK>	<29%>
	Which now they hold by force and not by right;
	For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,
	The issue of the next son should have reign'd.
</YORK>

<SALISBURY>	<29%>
	But William of Hatfield died without an heir.
</SALISBURY>

<YORK>	<29%>
	The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line
	I claim the crown, had issue, Philippe a daughter,
	Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:
	Edmund had issue Roger, Earl of March:
	Roger had issue Edmund, Anne, and Eleanor.
</YORK>

<SALISBURY>	<29%>
	This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,
	As I have read, laid claim unto the crown;
	And but for Owen Glendower, had been king,
	Who kept him in captivity till he died.
	But, to the rest.
</SALISBURY>

<YORK>	<30%>
	His eldest sister, Anne,
	My mother, being heir unto the crown,
	Married Richard, Earl of Cambridge, who was son
	To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son.
	By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir
	To Roger, Earl of March; who was the son
	Of Edmund Mortimer; who married Philippe,
	Sole daughter unto Lionel, Duke of Clarence:
	So, if the issue of the eldest son
	Succeed before the younger, I am king.
</YORK>

<WARWICK>	<30%>
	What plain proceeding is more plain than this?
	Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,
	The fourth son; York claims it from the third.
	Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign:
	It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee,
	And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.
	Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together,
	And in this private plot be we the first
	That shall salute our rightful sovereign
	With honour of his birthright to the crown.
</WARWICK>

<BOTH>	<30%>
	Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!
</BOTH>

<YORK>	<30%>
	We thank you, lords! But I am not your king
	Till I be crown'd, and that my sword be stain'd
	With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;
	And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,
	But with advice and silent secrecy.
	Do you as I do in these dangerous days,
	Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,
	At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,
	At Buckingham and all the crew of them,
	Till they have snar'd the shepherd of the flock,
	That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:
	'Tis that they seek; and they, in seeking that
	Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.
</YORK>

<SALISBURY>	<30%>
	My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.
</SALISBURY>

<WARWICK>	<31%>
	My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick
	Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.
</WARWICK>

<YORK>	<31%>
	And, Nevil, this I do assure myself,
	Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick
	The greatest man in England but the king.

	And follow'd with a rabble that rejoice
	To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans.
	The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet,
	And when I start, the envious people laugh,
	And bid me be advised how I tread.
	Ah, Humphrey! can I bear this shameful yoke?
	Trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world,
	Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?
	No; dark shall be my light, and night my day;
	To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.
	Sometime I'll say, I am Duke Humphrey's wife;
	And he a prince and ruler of the land:
	Yet so he rul'd and such a prince he was
	As he stood by whilst I, his forlorn duchess,
	Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock
	To every idle rascal follower.
	But be thou mild and blush not at my shame;
	Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death
	Hang over thee, as, sure, it shortly will;
	For Suffolk, he that can do all in all

	Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now.
</K. HENRY>

<Q. MARGARET>	<38%>
	Can you not see? or will ye not observe
	The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?
	With what a majesty he bears himself,
	How insolent of late he is become,
	How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?
	We know the time since he was mild and affable,
	An if we did but glance a far-off look,
	Immediately he was upon his knee,
	That all the court admir'd him for submission:
	But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,
	When everyone will give the time of day,
	He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,
	And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,
	Disdaining duty that to us belongs.
	Small curs are not regarded when they grin,
	But great men tremble when the lion roars;
	And Humphrey is no little man in England.
	First note that he is near you in descent,
	And should you fall, he is the next will mount.
	Me seemeth then it is no policy,
	Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears,
	And his advantage following your decease,
	That he should come about your royal person
	Or be admitted to your highness' council.
	By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts,
	And when he please to make commotion,
	'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.
	Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;
	Suffer them now and they'll o'ergrow the garden,
	And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.
	The reverent care I bear unto my lord
	Made me collect these dangers in the duke.
	If it be fond, call it a woman's fear;
	Which fear if better reasons can supplant,
	I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke.
	My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,
	Reprove my allegation if you can
	Or else conclude my words effectual.
</Q. MARGARET>

<SUFFOLK>	<39%>
	Well hath your highness seen into this duke;
	And had I first been put to speak my mind,
	I think I should have told your Grace's tale.
	The duchess, by his subornation,
	Upon my life, began her devilish practices:
	Or if he were not privy to those faults,
	Yet, by reputing of his high descent,
	As, next the king he was successive heir,
	And such high vaunts of his nobility,
	Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess,
	By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.
	Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep,
	And in his simple show he harbours treason.
	The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb:
	No, no, my sov'reign; Gloucester is a man
	Unsounded yet, and full of deep deceit.

	From meaning treason to our royal person,
	As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove.
	The duke is virtuous, mild, and too well given
	To dream on evil, or to work my downfall.
</K. HENRY>

<Q. MARGARET>	<40%>
	Ah! what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!
	Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrow'd,

	Is it but thought so? What are they that think it?

	Ah! gracious lord, these days are dangerous.
	Virtue is chok'd with foul ambition,

	Foul subornation is predominant,
	And equity exil'd your highness' land.
	I know their complot is to have my life;
	And if my death might make this island happy,
	And prove the period of their tyranny,
	I would expend it with all willingness;
	But mine is made the prologue to their play;
	For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,
	Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.
	Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,
	And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;
	Sharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue
	The envious load that lies upon his heart;
	And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,
	Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,
	By false accuse doth level at my life:
	And you, my sov'reign lady, with the rest,
	Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,
	And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up
	My liefest liege to be mine enemy.
	Ay, all of you have laid your heads together;
	Myself had notice of your conventicles;
	And all to make away my guiltless life.

	What low'ring star now envies thy estate,

	Well, nobles, well; 'tis politicly done,
	To send me packing with a host of men:
	I fear me you but warm the starved snake,

	'Twas men I lack'd, and you will give them me:

	You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.
	Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,
	I will stir up in England some black storm
	Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;
	And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage

	In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
	Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,
	And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts
	Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine:
	And, in the end being rescu'd, I have seen
	Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,
	Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.
	Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,
	Hath he conversed with the enemy,
	And undiscover'd come to me again,
	And given me notice of their villanies.
	This devil here shall be my substitute;
	For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,
	In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble;
	By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,
	How they affect the house and claim of York.
	Say he be taken, rack'd, and tortured,
	I know no pain they can inflict upon him
	Will make him say I mov'd him to those arms.
	Say that he thrive,—as 'tis great like he will,—
	Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength,
	And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;
	For, Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,
	And Henry put apart, the next for me.

	Can chase away the first-conceived sound?
	Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words:
	Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say:
	Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.
	Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!
	Upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny
	Sits in grim majesty to fright the world.
	Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding:

	In life but double death, now Gloucester's dead.

	Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?
	Although the duke was enemy to him,

	Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,
	I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,
	Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,
	And all to have the noble duke alive.
	What know I how the world may deem of me?
	For it is known we were but hollow friends:
	It may be judg'd I made the duke away:
	So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded,
	And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.
	This get I by his death. Ay me, unhappy!

	Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.
	What! dost thou turn away and hide thy face?
	I am no loathsome leper; look on me.
	What! art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf?
	Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen.
	Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?
	Why, then, Dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy:
	Erect his statua and worship it,
	And make my image but an alehouse sign.
	Was I for this nigh wrack'd upon the sea,
	And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
	Drove back again unto my native clime?
	What boded this, but well forewarning wind
	Did seem to say, 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,
	Nor set no footing on this unkind shore?'
	What did I then, but curs'd the gentle gusts
	And he that loos'd them forth their brazen caves;
	And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,
	Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock?
	Yet Æolus would not be a murderer,
	But left that hateful office unto thee:
	The pretty vaulting sea refus'd to drown me,
	Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore
	With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness:
	The splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands,
	And would not dash me with their ragged sides,
	Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,
	Might in thy palace perish Margaret.
	As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
	When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,
	I stood upon the hatches in the storm,
	And when the dusky sky began to rob
	My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,
	I took a costly jewel from my neck,
	A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,
	And threw it towards thy land: the sea receiv'd it,
	And so I wish'd thy body might my heart:
	And even with this I lost fair England's view,
	And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,
	And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles
	For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.
	How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue—
	The agent of thy foul inconstancy—
	To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did
	When he to madding Dido would unfold
	His father's acts, commenc'd in burning Troy!
	Am I not witch'd like her? or thou not false like him?
	Ay me! I can no more. Die, Margaret!
	For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.

	A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!
	What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?
</SUFFOLK>

<WARWICK>	<54%>
	See how the blood is settled in his face.
	Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,
	Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale, and bloodless,
	Being all descended to the labouring heart;
	Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,
	Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy;
	Which with the heart there cools, and ne'er returneth
	To blush and beautify the cheek again.
	But see, his face is black and full of blood,
	His eyeballs further out than when he liv'd,
	Staring full ghastly like a strangled man;
	His hair uprear'd, his nostrils stretch'd with struggling:
	His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd
	And tugg'd for life, and was by strength subdu'd.
	Look on the sheets, his hair, you see, is sticking;
	His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged,
	Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodg'd.
	It cannot be but he was murder'd here;
	The least of all these signs were probable.
</WARWICK>

	They say, by him the good Duke Humphrey died;
	They say, in him they fear your highness' death;
	And mere instinct of love and loyalty,
	Free from a stubborn opposite intent,
	As being thought to contradict your liking,
	Makes them thus forward in his banishment.
	They say, in care of your most royal person,
	That if your highness should intend to sleep,
	And charge that no man should disturb your rest
	In pain of your dislike or pain of death,
	Yet, notwithstanding such a strait edict,
	Were there a serpent seen, with forked tongue,
	That slily glided towards your majesty,
	It were but necessary you were wak'd,

	The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal:
	And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,
	That they will guard you, whe'r you will or no,

	And with the southern clouds contend in tears,
	Theirs for the earth's increase, mine for my sorrows?
	Now get thee hence: the king, thou know'st, is coming;
	If thou be found by me thou art but dead.
</Q. MARGARET>

<SUFFOLK>	<61%>
	If I depart from thee I cannot live;
	And in thy sight to die, what were it else
	But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?
	Here could I breathe my soul into the air,
	As mild and gentle as the cradle babe,
	Dying with mother's dug between its lips;
	Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad,
	And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,
	To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth:
	So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,
	Or I should breathe it so into thy body,
	And then it liv'd in sweet Elysium.
	To die by thee, were but to die in jest;
	From thee to die were torture more than death.
	O! let me stay, befall what may befall!
</SUFFOLK>

<Q. MARGARET>	<62%>
	Away! though parting be a fretful corsive,
	It is applied to a deathful wound.
	To France, sweet Suffolk: let me hear from thee;
	For wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe,
	I'll have an Iris that shall find thee out.
</Q. MARGARET>

<SUFFOLK>	<62%>

<SUFFOLK>	<62%>
	A jewel, lock'd into the woefull'st cask

<SCENE 1>
<Kent. The Seashore near Dover.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Firing heard at Sea. Then enter from a boat, a Captain,...>
<... a Master, a Master's-Mate, Walter Whitmore, and...>
<... Others; with them Suffolk disguised, and other Gentlemen, prisoners.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CAPTAIN>	<63%>
	The gaudy, blabbing, and remorseful day
	Is crept into the bosom of the sea,
	And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades
	That drag the tragic melancholy night;
	Who with their drowsy, slow, and flagging wings
	Clip dead men's graves, and from their misty jaws
	Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.
	Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize,
	For, whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs
	Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,
	Or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore.
	Master, this prisoner freely give I thee:
	And thou that art his mate make boot of this;
	The other <STAGE DIR>
<Pointing to Suffolk>
</STAGE DIR>, Walter Whitmore, is thy share.
</CAPTAIN>

<GENTLEMAN 1>	<64%>
	What is my ransom, master? let me know.
</GENTLEMAN 1>

<MASTER>	<64%>
	A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.
</MASTER>

<MATE>	<64%>
	And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.
</MATE>

<CAPTAIN>	<64%>
	What! think you much to pay two thousand crowns,
	And bear the name and port of gentlemen?
	Cut both the villains' throats! for die you shall:
	The lives of those which we have lost in fight
	Cannot be counterpois'd with such a petty sum!
</CAPTAIN>

<GENTLEMAN 1>	<64%>
	I'll give it, sir; and therefore spare my life.
</GENTLEMAN 1>

<GENTLEMAN 2>	<64%>
	And so will I, and write home for it straight.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<WHITMORE>	<64%>
	I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,
<STAGE DIR>
<To Suffolk.>
</STAGE DIR> And therefore to revenge it shalt thou die;
	And so should these if I might have my will.
</WHITMORE>

<CAPTAIN>	<64%>
	Be not so rash: take ransom; let him live.
</CAPTAIN>

<SUFFOLK>	<64%>
	Look on my George; I am a gentleman:
	Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
</SUFFOLK>

<WHITMORE>	<64%>
	And so am I; my name is Walter Whitmore.
	How now! why start'st thou? what! doth death affright?
</WHITMORE>

<SUFFOLK>	<65%>
	Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.
	A cunning man did calculate my birth,
	And told me that by Water I should die:
	Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;
	Thy name is—Gaultier, being rightly sounded.
</SUFFOLK>

<WHITMORE>	<65%>
	Gaultier, or Walter, which it is I care not;
	Never yet did base dishonour blur our name
	But with our sword we wip'd away the blot:
	Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,
	Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defac'd,
	And I proclaim'd a coward through the world!
</WHITMORE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Lays hold on Suffolk.>
</STAGE DIR>

<SUFFOLK>	<65%>
	Stay, Whitmore; for thy prisoner is a prince,
	The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.
</SUFFOLK>

<WHITMORE>	<65%>
	The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags!
</WHITMORE>

<SUFFOLK>	<65%>
	Ay, but these rags are no part of the duke:
	Jove sometimes went disguis'd, and why not I?
</SUFFOLK>

<CAPTAIN>	<65%>
	But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.
</CAPTAIN>

<SUFFOLK>	<65%>
	Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood,
	The honourable blood of Lancaster,
	Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.
	Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?
	Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule,
	And thought thee happy when I shook my head?
	How often hast thou waited at my cup,
	Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board,
	When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?
	Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n;
	Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride.
	How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood
	And duly waited for my coming forth?
	This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,
	And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.
</SUFFOLK>

<WHITMORE>	<66%>
	Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?
</WHITMORE>

<CAPTAIN>	<66%>
	First let my words stab him, as he hath me.
</CAPTAIN>

<SUFFOLK>	<66%>
	Base slave, thy words are blunt, and so art thou.
</SUFFOLK>

<CAPTAIN>	<66%>
	Convey him hence, and on our longboat's side
	Strike off his head.
</CAPTAIN>

<SUFFOLK>	<66%>
	Thou dar'st not for thy own.
</SUFFOLK>

<CAPTAIN>	<66%>
	Yes, Pole.
</CAPTAIN>

<SUFFOLK>	<66%>
	Pole!
</SUFFOLK>

<CAPTAIN>	<66%>
	Pool! Sir Pool! lord!
	Ay, kennel, puddle, sink; whose filth and dirt
	Troubles the silver spring where England drinks.
	Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
	For swallowing the treasure of the realm:
	Thy lips, that kiss'd the queen, shall sweep the ground;
	And thou, that smil'dst at good Duke Humphrey's death,
	Against the senseless winds shall grin in vain,
	Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again:
	And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,
	For daring to affy a mighty lord
	Unto the daughter of a worthless king,
	Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem.
	By devilish policy art thou grown great,
	And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorg'd
	With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart.
	By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France,
	The false revolting Normans thorough thee
	Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy
	Hath slain their governors, surpris'd our forts,
	And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.
	The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all,
	Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,
	As hating thee, are rising up in arms:
	And now the house of York, thrust from the crown
	By shameful murder of a guiltless king,
	And lofty proud encroaching tyranny,
	Burns with revenging fire; whose hopeful colours
	Advance our half-fac'd sun, striving to shine,
	Under the which is writ Invitis nubibus.
	The commons here in Kent are up in arms;
	And to conclude, reproach and beggary
	Is crept into the palace of our king,
	And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.
</CAPTAIN>

<SUFFOLK>	<67%>
	O! that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder
	Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges.
	Small things make base men proud: this villain here,
	Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more
	Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate.
	Drones suck not eagles' blood, but rob beehives.
	It is impossible that I should die
	By such a lowly vassal as thyself.
	Thy words move rage, and not remorse in me:
	I go of message from the queen to France;
	I charge thee, waft me safely cross the Channel.
</SUFFOLK>

<CAPTAIN>	<67%>
	Walter!
</CAPTAIN>

<WHITMORE>	<67%>
	Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.

<SUFFOLK>	<67%>
	Gelidus timor occupat artus: 'tis thee I fear.

<WHITMORE>	<67%>
	Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.
	What! are ye daunted now? now will ye stoop?
</WHITMORE>

<GENTLEMAN 1>	<67%>
	My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.
</GENTLEMAN 1>

<SUFFOLK>	<67%>
	Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough,
	Us'd to command, untaught to plead for favour.
	Far be it we should honour such as these
	With humble suit: no, rather let my head
	Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
	Save to the God of heaven, and to my king;
	And sooner dance upon a bloody pole
	Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.
	True nobility is exempt from fear:
	More can I bear than you dare execute.
</SUFFOLK>

<CAPTAIN>	<67%>
	Hale him away, and let him talk no more.
</CAPTAIN>

<SUFFOLK>	<67%>
	Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,
	That this my death may never be forgot.
	Great men oft die by vile bezonians.
	A Roman sworder and banditto slave
	Murder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand
	Stabb'd Julius Cæsar; savage islanders
	Pompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates.

Be it known unto thee by these presence, even the presence of Lord Mortimer, that I am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such filth as thou art. Thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a grammar-school; and whereas, before, our fore-fathers had no other books but the score and the tally, thou hast caused printing to be used; and, contrary to the king, his crown, and dignity, thou hast built a paper-mill. It will be proved to thy face that thou hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and a verb, and such abominable words as no Christian car can endure to hear. Thou hast appointed justices of peace, to call poor men before them about matters they were not able to answer. Moreover, thou hast put them in prison; and because they could not read, thou hast hanged them; when indeed only for that cause they have been most worthy to live.

	Thus stands my state, 'twixt Cade and York distress'd;
	Like to a ship, that, having scap'd a tempest,
	Is straight way calm'd, and boarded with a pirate.
	But now is Cade driven back, his men dispers'd;
	And now is York in arms to second him.
	I pray thee, Buckingham, go and meet him,
	And ask him what's the reason of these arms.
	Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower;
	And, Somerset, we will commit thee thither,
	Until his army be dismiss'd from him.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Cade.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CADE>	<86%>
	Fie on ambition! fie on myself, that have a sword, and yet am ready to famish! These five days have I hid me in these woods and durst not peep out, for all the country is laid for me; but now I am so hungry, that if I might have a lease of my life for a thousand years I could stay no longer. Wherefore, on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden, to see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another while, which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet' was born to do me good: for many a time, but for a sallet, my brain-pan had been cleft with a brown bill; and many a time, when I have been dry, and bravely marching, it hath served me instead of a quart-pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet' must serve me to feed on.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Iden with Servants behind.>
</STAGE DIR>
<IDEN>	<87%>
	Lord! who would live turmoiled in the court,
	And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?
	This small inheritance my father left me
	Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy.
	I seek not to wax great by others' waning,
	Or gather wealth I care not with what envy:
	Sufficeth that I have maintains my state,
	And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.
</IDEN>

<CADE>	<87%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray, for entering his fee-simple without leave. Ah, villain! thou wilt betray me, and get a thousand crowns of the king by carrying my head to him; but I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich, and swallow my sword like a great pin, ere thou and I part.
</CADE>

<IDEN>	<87%>
	Why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be,
	I know thee not; why then should I betray thee?
	Is't not enough to break into my garden,
	And like a thief to come to rob my grounds,
	Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,
	But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?
</IDEN>

<CADE>	<87%>
	Brave thee! ay, by the best blood that ever was broached, and beard thee too. Look on me well: I have eat no meat these five days; yet, come thou and thy five men, and if I do not leave you all as dead as a door-nail, I pray God I may never eat grass more.
</CADE>

<IDEN>	<87%>
	Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,
	That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent,
	Took odds to combat a poor famish'd man.
	Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine,
	See if thou canst out-face me with thy looks:
	Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser;
	Thy hand is but a finger to my fist;
	Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon;
	My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;
	And if mine arm be heaved in the air
	Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth.
	As for more words, whose greatness answers words,
	Let this my sword report what speech forbears.
</IDEN>

<CADE>	<88%>
	By my valour, the most complete champion that ever I heard! Steel, if thou turn the edge, or cut not out the burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere thou sleep in thy sheath, I beseech Jove on my knees, thou mayst be turned to hobnails. <STAGE DIR>
<They fight; Cade falls.>
</STAGE DIR> O, I am slain! Famine and no other hath slain me: let ten thousand devils come against me, and give me but the ten meals I have lost, and I'll defy them all. Wither, garden; and be henceforth a burying-place to all that do dwell in this house, because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled.
</CADE>

<IDEN>	<88%>
	Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?
	Sword, I will hallow thee for this thy deed,
	And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead:
	Ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point,
	But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat,
	To emblaze the honour that thy master got.
</IDEN>

<CADE>	<88%>
	Iden, farewell; and be proud of thy victory. Tell Kent from me, she hath lost her best man, and exhort all the world to be cowards; for I, that never feared any, am vanquished by famine, not by valour.
</CADE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Dies.>
</STAGE DIR>

<IDEN>	<88%>
	How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.
	Die, damned wretch, the curse of her that bare thee!
	And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,
	So wish I I might thrust thy soul to hell.
	Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels
	Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave,
	And there cut off thy most ungracious head;
	Which I will bear in triumph to the king,
	Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.

<STAGE DIR>
<The King's camp on one side. On the other, enter York,...>
<... and his army of Irish, with drum and colours.>
</STAGE DIR>
<YORK>	<89%>
	From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right,
	And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head:
	Ring, bells, aloud; burn, bonfires, clear and bright,
	To entertain great England's lawful king.
	Ah sancta majestas, who would not buy thee dear?
	Let them obey that know not how to rule;
	This hand was made to handle nought but gold:
	I cannot give due action to my words,
	Except a sword, or sceptre balance it.
	A sceptre shall it have, have I-a soul,
	On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Buckingham.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me?
</YORK>
	The king hath sent him, sure: I must dissemble.
<BUCKINGHAM>	<89%>
	York, if thou meanest well, I greet thee well.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<YORK>	<89%>
	Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.
	Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?
</YORK>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<89%>
	A messenger from Henry, our dread hege,
	To know the reason of these arms in peace;
	Or why thou,—being a subject as I am,—
	Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,
	Shouldst raise so great a power without his leave,
	Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<YORK>	<90%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great:
	O! I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,
	I am so angry at these abject terms;
	And now, like Ajax Telamonius,
	On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.
	I am far better born than is the king,
	More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts;
	But I must make fair weather yet awhile,
	Till Henry be more weak, and I more strong.
<STAGE DIR>
<Aloud.>
</STAGE DIR> Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me,
	That I have given no answer all this while;
	My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.
	The cause why I have brought this army hither
	Is to remove proud Somerset from the king,
	Seditious to his Grace and to the state.
</YORK>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<90%>
	That is too much presumption on thy part:
	But if thy arms be to no other end,
	The king hath yielded unto thy demand:
	The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<YORK>	<90%>
	Upon thine honour, is he a prisoner?
</YORK>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<90%>
	Upon mine honour, he is a prisoner.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<YORK>	<90%>
	Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers.
	Soldiers, I thank you all; disperse yourselves;
	Meet me to-morrow in Saint George's field,
	You shall have pay, and everything you wish,
	And let my sov'reign, virtuous Henry,
	Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,
	As pledges of my fealty and love;
	I'll send them all as willing as I live:
	Lands, goods, horse, armour, anything I have
	Is his to use, so Somerset may die.

<K. HENRY>	<91%>
	The head of Cade! Great God, how just art thou!

<K. HENRY>	<91%>
	How art thou call'd, and what is thy degree?

	So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss

	How now! is Somerset at liberty?
	Then, York, unloose thy long-imprison'd thoughts
	And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.
	Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?
	False king! why hast thou broken faith with me,
	Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
	King did I call thee? no, thou art not king;
	Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,
	Which dar'st not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.
	That head of thine doth not become a crown;
	Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff,
	And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.
	That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,
	Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles' spear,
	Is able with the change to kill and cure.
	Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up,
	And with the same to act controlling laws.
	Give place: by heaven, thou shalt rule no more
	O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.

<Enter Richard and Somerset, fighting; Somerset is killed.>
</STAGE DIR>
<RICHARD>	<98%>
	So, lie thou there;
	For underneath an alehouse' paltry sign,
	The Castle in Saint Alban's, Somerset
	Hath made the wizard famous in his death.
	Sword, hold thy temper; heart, be wrathful still:
	Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.

<Alarums: Excursions. Enter King Henry, Queen Margaret, and Others, retreating.>
</STAGE DIR>
<Q. MARGARET>	<98%>
	Away, my lord! you are slow: for shame, away!
</Q. MARGARET>

<K. HENRY>	<98%>
	Can we outrun the heavens? good Margaret, stay.
</K. HENRY>

<Q. MARGARET>	<98%>
	What are you made of? you'll nor fight nor fly:
	Now is it manhood, wisdom, and defence,
	To give the enemy way, and to secure us
	By what we can, which can no more but fly.
<STAGE DIR>
<Alarum afar off.>
</STAGE DIR>
	If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom
	Of all our fortunes: but if we haply scape,
	As well we may, if not through your neglect,
	We shall to London get, where you are lov'd,
	And where this breach now in our fortunes made
	May readily be stopp'd.

</Q. MARGARET>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Young Clifford.>
</STAGE DIR>
<YOUNG CLIFFORD>	<99%>
	But that my heart's on future mischief set,
	I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly;
	But fly you must: uncurable discomfit
	Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts.
	Away, for your relief! and we will live
	To see their day and them our fortune give.
	Away, my lord, away!

<Field near Saint Alban's.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Alarum. Retreat. Flourish; then enter York, Richard, Warwick, and Soldiers, with drum and colours.>
</STAGE DIR>
<YORK>	<99%>
	Of Salisbury, who can report of him;
	That winter lion, who in rage forgets
	Aged contusions and all brush of time,
	And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,
	Repairs him with occasion? this happy day
	Is not itself, nor have we won one foot,
	If Salisbury be lost.
</YORK>

<RICHARD>	<99%>
	My noble father,
	Three times to-day I holp him to his horse,
	Three times bestrid him; thrice I led him off,
	Persuaded him from any further act:
	But still, where danger was, still there I met him;
	And like rich hangings in a homely house,
	So was his will in his old feeble body.
	But, noble as he is, look where he comes.

</RICHARD>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Salisbury.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SALISBURY>	<99%>
	Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought to-day;
	By the mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard:
	God knows how long it is I have to live;
	And it hath pleas'd him that three times to-day
	You have defended me from imminent death.
	Well, lords, we have not got that which we have:
	'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,
	Being opposites of such repairing nature.
</SALISBURY>

<YORK>	<100%>
	I know our safety is to follow them;

	For, as I hear, the king is fled to London,
	To call a present court of parliament:
	Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth:—
	What says Lord Warwick? shall we after them?
</YORK>

<WARWICK>	<100%>
	After them! nay, before them, if we can.
	Now, by my hand, lords, 'twas a glorious day:
	Saint Alban's battle, won by famous York,
	Shall be eterniz'd in all age to come.
	Sound, drums and trumpets, and to London all:
	And more such days as these to us befall!
