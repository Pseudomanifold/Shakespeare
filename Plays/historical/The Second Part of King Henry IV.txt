<RUMOUR>	<0%>
	Open your ears; for which of you will stop
	The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?
	I, from the orient to the drooping west,
	Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold
	The acts commenced on this ball of earth:
	Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,
	The which in every language I pronounce,
	Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.
	I speak of peace, while covert enmity
	Under the smile of safety wounds the world:
	And who but Rumour, who but only I,
	Make fearful musters and prepar'd defence,
	Whilst the big year, swoln with some other grief,
	Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,
	And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe
	Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures,
	And of so easy and so plain a stop
	That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,
	The still-discordant wavering multitude,
	Can play upon it. But what need I thus
	My well-known body to anatomize
	Among my household? Why is Rumour here?
	I run before King Harry's victory;
	Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury
	Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,
	Quenching the flame of bold rebellion
	Even with the rebels' blood. But what mean I
	To speak so true at first? my office is
	To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
	Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,
	And that the king before the Douglas' rage
	Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.
	This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns
	Between the royal field of Shrewsbury
	And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,
	Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,
	Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,
	And not a man of them brings other news
	Than they have learn'd of me: from Rumour's tongues
	They bring smooth comforts false, worse than true wrongs.

</RUMOUR>
<SCENE 1>
<Warkworth. Before Northumberland's Castle.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Lord Bardolph.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BARDOLPH>	<2%>
	Who keeps the gate here? ho!
<STAGE DIR>
<The Porter opens the gate.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Where is the earl?
</BARDOLPH>

<PORTER>	<2%>
	What shall I say you are?
</PORTER>

<BARDOLPH>	<2%>
	Tell thou the earl
	That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.
</BARDOLPH>

<PORTER>	<2%>
	His Lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard:
	Please it your honour knock but at the gate,
	And he himself will answer.

</PORTER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Northumberland.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BARDOLPH>	<2%>
	Here comes the earl.
</BARDOLPH>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Porter.>
</STAGE DIR>

<NORTHUMBERLAND>	<2%>
	What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute now
	Should be the father of some stratagem.
	The times are wild; contention, like a horse
	Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose
	And bears down all before him.
</NORTHUMBERLAND>

<BARDOLPH>	<2%>
	Noble earl,
	I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.
</BARDOLPH>

<NORTHUMBERLAND>	<2%>
	Good, an God will!
</NORTHUMBERLAND>

<BARDOLPH>	<2%>
	As good as heart can wish.
	The king is almost wounded to the death;
	And, in the fortune of my lord your son,
	Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts
	Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John
	And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field.
	And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,
	Is prisoner to your son: O! such a day,
	So fought, so follow'd, and so fairly won,
	Came not till now to dignify the times
	Since Cæsar's fortunes.
</BARDOLPH>

<NORTHUMBERLAND>	<2%>
	How is this deriv'd?
	Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?
</NORTHUMBERLAND>

<BARDOLPH>	<2%>
	I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence;
	A gentleman well bred and of good name,
	That freely render'd me these news for true.
</BARDOLPH>

<NORTHUMBERLAND>	<2%>
	Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent
	On Tuesday last to listen after news.
</NORTHUMBERLAND>

<BARDOLPH>	<3%>
	My lord, I over-rode him on the way;
	And he is furnish'd with no certainties
	More than he haply may retail from me.

</BARDOLPH>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Travers.>
</STAGE DIR>
<NORTHUMBERLAND>	<3%>
	Now, Travers, what good tidings come with you?
</NORTHUMBERLAND>

<TRAVERS>	<3%>
	My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back
	With joyful tidings; and, being better hors'd,
	Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
	A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
	That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.
	He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him
	I did demand what news from Shrewsbury.
	He told me that rebellion had bad luck,
	And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.
	With that he gave his able horse the head,
	And, bending forward struck his armed heels
	Against the panting sides of his poor jade
	Up to the rowel-head, and, starting so,
	He seem'd in running to devour the way,
	Staying no longer question.
</TRAVERS>

<NORTHUMBERLAND>	<3%>
	Ha! Again:
	Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?
	Of Hotspur, Coldspur? that rebellion
	Had met ill luck?
</NORTHUMBERLAND>

<BARDOLPH>	<3%>
	My lord, I'll tell you what:
	If my young lord your son have not the day,
	Upon mine honour, for a silken point
	I'll give my barony: never talk of it.
</BARDOLPH>

<NORTHUMBERLAND>	<3%>
	Why should the gentleman that rode by Travers
	Give then such instances of loss?
</NORTHUMBERLAND>

<BARDOLPH>	<3%>
	Who, he?
	He was some hilding fellow that had stolen
	The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,
	Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.

</BARDOLPH>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Morton.>
</STAGE DIR>
<NORTHUMBERLAND>	<3%>
	Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,
	Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:
	So looks the strond, whereon the imperious flood
	Hath left a witness'd usurpation.
	Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?
</NORTHUMBERLAND>

<MORTON>	<4%>
	I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;
	Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
	To fright our party.
</MORTON>

<NORTHUMBERLAND>	<4%>
	How doth my son and brother?
	Thou tremblest, and the whiteness in thy cheek
	Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.
	Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,
	So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,
	Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,
	And would have told him half his Troy was burn'd;
	But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,
	And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.
	This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;
	Your brother thus; so fought the noble Douglas;'
	Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:
	But in the end, to stop mine ear indeed,
	Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,
	Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'
</NORTHUMBERLAND>

<MORTON>	<4%>
	Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;
	But, for my lord your son,—
</MORTON>

<NORTHUMBERLAND>	<4%>
	Why, he is dead.—
	See, what a ready tongue suspicion hath!
	He that but fears the thing he would not know
	Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes
	That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton:
	Tell thou thy earl his divination lies,
	And I will take it as a sweet disgrace
	And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.
</NORTHUMBERLAND>

<MORTON>	<4%>
	You are too great to be by me gainsaid;
	Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.
</MORTON>

<NORTHUMBERLAND>	<4%>
	Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.
	I see a strange confession in thine eye:
	Thou shak'st thy head, and hold'st it fear or sin
	To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;
	The tongue offends not that reports his death:
	And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,
	Not he which says the dead is not alive.
	Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
	Hath but a losing office, and his tongue
	Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,
	Remember'd knolling a departing friend.
</NORTHUMBERLAND>

<BARDOLPH>	<5%>
	I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.
</BARDOLPH>

<MORTON>	<5%>
	I am sorry I should force you to believe
	That which I would to God I had not seen;
	But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,
	Rendering faint quittance, wearied and outbreath'd,
	To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down
	The never-daunted Percy to the earth,
	From whence with life he never more sprung up.
	In few, his death,—whose spirit lent a fire
	Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,—
	Being bruited once, took fire and heat away
	From the best-temper'd courage in his troops;
	For from his metal was his party steel'd;
	Which once in him abated, all the rest
	Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:
	And as the thing that's heavy in itself,
	Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,
	So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,
	Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
	That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
	Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,
	Fly from the field. Then was that noble Worcester
	Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,
	The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword
	Had three times slain the appearance of the king,
	'Gan vail his stomach, and did grace the shame
	Of those that turn'd their backs; and in his flight,
	Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all
	Is, that the king hath won, and hath sent out
	A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
	Under the conduct of young Lancaster
	And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.
</MORTON>

<NORTHUMBERLAND>	<6%>
	For this I shall have time enough to mourn.
	In poison there is physic; and these news,
	Having been well, that would have made me sick,
	Being sick, have in some measure made me well:
	And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints,
	Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,
	Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire
	Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,
	Weaken'd with grief, being now enrag'd with grief,
	Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!
	A scaly gauntlet now, with joints of steel
	Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!
	Thou art a guard too wanton for the head
	Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.
	Now bind my brows with iron; and approach
	The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring
	To frown upon the enrag'd Northumberland!
	Let heaven kiss earth! now let not nature's hand
	Keep the wild flood confin'd! let order die!
	And let this world no longer be a stage
	To feed contention in a lingering act;
	But let one spirit of the first-born Cain
	Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set
	On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,
	And darkness be the burier of the dead!
</NORTHUMBERLAND>

<TRAVERS>	<6%>
	This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.
</TRAVERS>

<BARDOLPH>	<6%>
	Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.
</BARDOLPH>

<MORTON>	<6%>
	The lives of all your loving complices
	Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er
	To stormy passion must perforce decay.
	You cast the event of war, my noble lord,
	And summ'd the account of chance, before you said,
	'Let us make head.' It was your presurmise
	That in the dole of blows your son might drop:
	You knew he walk'd o'er perils, on an edge,
	More likely to fall in than to get o'er;
	You were advis'd his flesh was capable
	Of wounds and scars, and that his forward spirit
	Would lift him where most trade of danger rang'd:
	Yet did you say, 'Go forth;' and none of this,
	Though strongly apprehended, could restrain
	The stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,
	Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,
	More than that being which was like to be?
</MORTON>

<BARDOLPH>	<7%>
	We all that are engaged to this loss
	Knew that we ventur'd on such dangerous seas
	That if we wrought out life 'twas ten to one;
	And yet we ventur'd, for the gain propos'd
	Chok'd the respect of likely peril fear'd;
	And since we are o'erset, venture again.
	Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.
</BARDOLPH>

<MORTON>	<7%>
	'Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord,
	I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,
	The gentle Archbishop of York is up,
	With well-appointed powers: he is a man
	Who with a double surety binds his followers.
	My lord your son had only but the corpse',
	But shadows and the shows of men to fight;
	For that same word, rebellion, did divide
	The action of their bodies from their souls;
	And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,
	As men drink potions, that their weapons only
	Seem'd on our side: but, for their spirits and souls,
	This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,
	As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop
	Turns insurrection to religion:
	Suppos'd sincere and holy in his thoughts,
	He's follow'd both with body and with mind,
	And doth enlarge his rising with the blood
	Of fair King Richard, scrap'd from Pomfret stones;
	Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;
	Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,
	Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;
	And more and less do flock to follow him.
</MORTON>

<NORTHUMBERLAND>	<8%>
	I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,
	This present grief had wip'd it from my mind.
	Go in with me; and counsel every man
	The aptest way for safety and revenge:
	Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed:
	Never so few, and never yet more need.

<London. A Street.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Sir John Falstaff, with his Page bearing his sword and buckler.>
</STAGE DIR>
<FALSTAFF>	<8%>
	Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?
</FALSTAFF>

<PAGE>	<8%>
	He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy water; but, for the party that owed it, he might have more diseases than he knew for.
</PAGE>

<FALSTAFF>	<8%>
	Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: the brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not able to invent anything that tends to laughter, more than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off, why then I have no judgment. Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never manned with an agate till now; but I will set you neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and send you back again to your master, for a jewel; the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his cheek; and yet he will not stick to say, his face is a face-royal: God may finish it when he will, it is not a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still as a face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it; and yet he will be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He may keep his own grace, but he is almost out of mine, I can assure him. What said Master Dombledon about the satin for my short cloak and my slops?
</FALSTAFF>

<PAGE>	<9%>
	He said, sir, you should procure him better assurance than Bardolph; he would not take his bond and yours: he liked not the security.
</PAGE>

<FALSTAFF>	<9%>
	Let him be damned like the glutton! may his tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! a rascally yea-forsooth knave! to bear a gentleman in hand, and then stand upon security. The whoreson smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is thorough with them in honest taking up, then they must stand upon security. I had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with security. I looked a' should have sent me two and twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he sends me security. Well, he may sleep in security; for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness of his wife shines through it: and yet cannot he see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him. Where's Bardolph?
</FALSTAFF>

<PAGE>	<10%>
	He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse.
</PAGE>

<FALSTAFF>	<10%>
	I bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse in Smithfield: an I could get me but a wife in the stews, I were manned, horsed, and wived.

	Falstaff, an't please your lordship.

<CH. JUSTICE>	<10%>
	He that was in question for the robbery?
</CH. JUSTICE>

<SERVANT>	<10%>
	He, my lord; but he hath since done good service at Shrewsbury, and, as I hear, is now going with some charge to the Lord John of Lancaster.

	What, to York? Call him back again.

	You must speak louder, my master is deaf.

</CH. JUSTICE>

<SERVANT>	<10%>
	Sir John!
</SERVANT>

<FALSTAFF>	<10%>
	What! a young knave, and beg! Is there not wars? is there not employment? doth not the king lack subjects? do not the rebels want soldiers? Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side, were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it.
</FALSTAFF>

<SERVANT>	<11%>
	You mistake me, sir.
</SERVANT>

<FALSTAFF>	<11%>
	Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied in my throat if I had said so.
</FALSTAFF>

<SERVANT>	<11%>
	I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and your soldiership aside, and give me leave to tell you you lie in your throat if you say I am any other than an honest man.
</SERVANT>

<FALSTAFF>	<11%>
	I give thee leave to tell me so! I lay aside that which grows to me! If thou gett'st any leave of me, hang me: if thou takest leave, thou wert better be hanged. You hunt-counter: hence! avaunt!

<SERVANT>	<11%>
	Sir, my lord would speak with you.
</SERVANT>

<CH. JUSTICE>	<11%>
	Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.
</CH. JUSTICE>

<FALSTAFF>	<11%>
	My good lord! God give your lordship good time of day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad; I heard say your lordship was sick: I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I most humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverend care of your health.
</FALSTAFF>

<CH. JUSTICE>	<11%>
	Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to Shrewsbury.
</CH. JUSTICE>

<FALSTAFF>	<11%>
	An't please your lordship, I hear his majesty is returned with some discomfort from Wales.
</FALSTAFF>

<CH. JUSTICE>	<11%>
	I talk not of his majesty. You would not come when I sent for you.
</CH. JUSTICE>

<FALSTAFF>	<11%>
	And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into this same whoreson apoplexy.
</FALSTAFF>

<CH. JUSTICE>	<11%>
	Well, heaven mend him! I pray you, let me speak with you.
</CH. JUSTICE>

<FALSTAFF>	<11%>
	This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy, an't please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the blood, a whoreson tingling.
</FALSTAFF>

<CH. JUSTICE>	<12%>
	What tell you me of it? be it as it is.
</CH. JUSTICE>

<FALSTAFF>	<12%>
	It hath its original from much grief, from study and perturbation of the brain. I have read the cause of his effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness.
</FALSTAFF>

<CH. JUSTICE>	<12%>
	I think you are fallen into the disease, for you hear not what I say to you.
</CH. JUSTICE>

<FALSTAFF>	<12%>
	Very well, my lord, very well: rather, an't please you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady of not marking, that I am troubled withal.
</FALSTAFF>

<CH. JUSTICE>	<12%>
	To punish you by the heels would amend the attention of your ears; and I care not if I do become your physician.
</CH. JUSTICE>

<FALSTAFF>	<12%>
	I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient: your lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how I should be your patient to follow your prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.
</FALSTAFF>

<CH. JUSTICE>	<12%>
	I sent for you, when there were matters against you for your life, to come speak with me.
</CH. JUSTICE>

<FALSTAFF>	<12%>
	As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the laws of this land-service, I did not come.
</FALSTAFF>

<CH. JUSTICE>	<12%>
	Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.

<CH. JUSTICE>	<12%>
	You have misled the youthful prince.

	The young prince hath misled me: I am the fellow with the great belly, and he my dog.
</FALSTAFF>

<CH. JUSTICE>	<12%>
	Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound: your day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your night's exploit on Gadshill: you may thank the unquiet time for your quiet o'er-posting that action.

	Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light, but I hope he that looks upon me will take me without weighing: and yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go, I cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these costermonger times that true valour is turned bear-herd: pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings: all the other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry. You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young; you measure the heat of our livers with the bitterness of your galls; and we that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess, are wags too.
</FALSTAFF>

<CH. JUSTICE>	<13%>
	Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth, that are written down old with all the characters of age? Have you not a moist eye, a dry hand, a yellow cheek, a white beard, a decreasing leg, an increasing belly? Is not your voice broken, your wind short, your chin double, your wit single, and every part about you blasted with antiquity, and will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!
</CH. JUSTICE>

<FALSTAFF>	<14%>
	My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon, with a white head, and something a round belly. For my voice, I have lost it with hollaing, and singing of anthems. To approve my youth further, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in judgment and understanding; and he that will caper with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the money, and have at him! For the box o' the ear that the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince, and you took it like a sensible lord. I have checked him for it, and the young lion repents; marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk and old sack.

	Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry. I hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster against the archbishop and the Earl of Northumberland.
</CH. JUSTICE>

<FALSTAFF>	<14%>
	Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home, that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day, and I brandish anything but my bottle, I would I might never spit white again. There is not a dangerous action can peep out his head but I am thrust upon it. Well, I cannot last ever. But it was always yet the trick of our English nation, if they have a good thing, to make it too common. If you will needs say I am an old man, you should give me rest. I would to God my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is: I were better to be eaten to death with rust than to be scoured to nothing with perpetual motion.

<SCROOP>	<16%>
	Thus have you heard our cause and known our means;
	And, my most noble friends, I pray you all,
	Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes:
	And first, Lord Marshal, what say you to it?
</SCROOP>

<MOWBRAY>	<16%>
	I well allow the occasion of our arms;
	But gladly would be better satisfied
	How in our means we should advance ourselves
	To look with forehead bold and big enough
	Upon the power and puissance of the king.
</MOWBRAY>

<HASTINGS>	<16%>
	Our present musters grow upon the file
	To five-and-twenty thousand men of choice;
	And our supplies live largely in the hope
	Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns
	With an incensed fire of injuries.
</HASTINGS>

<BARDOLPH>	<16%>
	The question, then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus:
	Whether our present five-and-twenty thousand
	May hold up head without Northumberland.
</BARDOLPH>

<HASTINGS>	<16%>
	With him, we may.
</HASTINGS>

<BARDOLPH>	<16%>
	Ay, marry, there's the point:
	But if without him we be thought too feeble,
	My judgment is, we should not step too far
	Till we had his assistance by the hand;
	For in a theme so bloody-fao'd as this,
	Conjecture, expectation, and surmise
	Of aids incertain should not be admitted.
</BARDOLPH>

<SCROOP>	<16%>
	'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for, indeed
	It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.
</SCROOP>

<BARDOLPH>	<17%>
	It was, my lord; who lin'd himself with hope,
	Eating the air on promise of supply,
	Flattering himself with project of a power
	Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts;
	And so, with great imagination
	Proper to madmen, led his powers to death,
	And winking leap'd into destruction.
</BARDOLPH>

<HASTINGS>	<17%>
	But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt
	To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.
</HASTINGS>

<BARDOLPH>	<17%>
	Yes, if this present quality of war,—
	Indeed the instant action,—a cause on foot,
	Lives so in hope, as in an early spring
	We see the appearing buds; which, to prove fruit,
	Hope gives not so much warrant as despair
	That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,
	We first survey the plot, then draw the model;
	And when we see the figure of the house,
	Then must we rate the cost of the erection;
	Which if we find outweighs ability,
	What do we then but draw anew the model
	In fewer offices, or at last desist
	To build at all? Much more, in this great work,—
	Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
	And set another up,—should we survey
	The plot of situation and the model,
	Consent upon a sure foundation,
	Question surveyors, know our own estate,
	How able such a work to undergo,
	To weigh against his opposite; or else,
	We fortify in paper, and in figures,
	Using the names of men instead of men:
	Like one that draws the model of a house
	Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,
	Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost
	A naked-subject to the weeping clouds,
	And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.
</BARDOLPH>

<HASTINGS>	<17%>
	Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth,
	Should be still-born, and that we now possess'd
	The utmost man of expectation;
	I think we are a body strong enough,
	Even as we are, to equal with the king.
</HASTINGS>

<BARDOLPH>	<18%>
	What! is the king but five-and-twenty thousand?
</BARDOLPH>

<HASTINGS>	<18%>
	To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph.
	For his divisions, as the times do brawl,
	Are in three heads: one power against the French,
	And one against Glendower; perforce, a third
	Must take up us: so is the unfirm king
	In three divided, and his coffers sound
	With hollow poverty and emptiness.
</HASTINGS>

<SCROOP>	<18%>
	That he should draw his several strengths together
	And come against us in full puissance,
	Need not be dreaded.
</SCROOP>

<HASTINGS>	<18%>
	If he should do so,
	He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh
	Baying him at the heels: never fear that.
</HASTINGS>

<BARDOLPH>	<18%>
	Who is it like should lead his forces hither?
</BARDOLPH>

<HASTINGS>	<18%>
	The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;
	Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth:
	But who is substituted 'gainst the French
	I have no certain notice.
</HASTINGS>

<SCROOP>	<18%>
	Let us on
	And publish the occasion of our arms.
	The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;

	Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.
	O thou fond many! with what loud applause
	Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke
	Before he was what thou wouldst have him be:
	And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,
	Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him
	That thou provok'st thyself to cast him up.
	So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge
	Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard,
	And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,
	And howl'st to find it. What trust is in these times?
	They that, when Richard liv'd, would have him die,
	Are now become enamour'd on his grave:
	Thou, that threw'st dust upon his goodly head,
	When through proud London he came sighing on
	After the admired heels of Bolingbroke,
	Cry'st now, 'O earth! yield us that king again,
	And take thou this!' O, thoughts of men accurst!
	Past and to come seem best; things present worst.

A hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to bear; and I have borne, and borne, and borne; and have been fubbed off, and fubbed off, and fubbed off, from this day to that day, that it is a shame to be thought on. There is no honesty in such dealing; unless a woman should be made an ass, and a beast, to bear every knave's wrong. Yonder he comes; and that arrant malmseynose knave, Bardolph, with him.

Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife Keech, the butcher's wife, come in then and call me gossip Quickly? coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar; telling us she had a good dish of prawns; whereby thou didst desire to eat some, whereby I told thee they were ill for a green wound? And didst thou not, when she was gone down-stairs, desire me to be no more so familiarity with such poor people; saying that ere long they should call me madam? And didst thou not kiss me and bid me fetch thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thy book-oath: deny it if thou canst.

What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name, or to know thy face to-morrow! or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast; viz. these, and those that were thy peach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy shirts; as, one for superfluity, and one other for use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better than I, for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done a great while, because the rest of thy low-countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland: and God knows whether those that bawl out the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom; but the midwives say the children are not in the fault; whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are mightily strengthened.

	By this hand, thou thinkest me as far in the devil's book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency: let the end try the man. But I tell thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick; and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.
</PRINCE>

<POINS>	<26%>
	The reason?

	It would be every man's thought; and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks: never a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way better than thine: every man would think me a hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most worshipful thought to think so?
</PRINCE>

<NORTHUMBERLAND>	<30%>
	I pray thee, loving wife, and gentle daughter,

	And be like them to Percy troublesome.
</NORTHUMBERLAND>

<LADY NORTHUMBERLAND>	<30%>

	Alas! sweet wife, my honour is at pawn;
	And, but my going, nothing can redeem it.
</NORTHUMBERLAND>

<LADY PERCY>	<30%>
	O! yet for God's sake, go not to these wars.
	The time was, father, that you broke your word
	When you were more endear'd to it than now;
	When your own Percy, when my heart's dear Harry,
	Threw many a northward look to see his father
	Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.
	Who then persuaded you to stay at home?
	There were two honours lost, yours and your son's:
	For yours, the God of heaven brighten it!
	For his, it stuck upon him as the sun
	In the grey vault of heaven; and by his light
	Did all the chivalry of England move
	To do brave acts: he was indeed the glass
	Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves:
	He had no legs, that practis'd not his gait;
	And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,
	Became the accents of the valiant;
	For those that could speak low and tardily,
	Would turn their own perfection to abuse,
	To seem like him: so that, in speech, in gait,
	In diet, in affections of delight,
	In military rules, humours of blood,
	He was the mark and glass, copy and book,
	That fashion'd others. And him, O wondrous him!
	O miracle of men! him did you leave,—
	Second to none, unseconded by you,—
	To look upon the hideous god of war
	In disadvantage; to abide a field
	Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur's name
	Did seem defensible: so you left him.
	Never, O! never, do his ghost the wrong
	To hold your honour more precise and nice
	With others than with him: let them alone.
	The marshal and the archbishop are strong:
	Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,
	To-day might I, hanging on Hotspur's neck,
	Have talk'd of Monmouth's grave.
</LADY PERCY>

<NORTHUMBERLAND>	<31%>
	Beshrew your heart,
	Fair daughter! you do draw my spirits from me
	With new lamenting ancient oversights.
	But I must go and meet with danger there,
	Or it will seek me in another place,
	And find me worse provided.
</NORTHUMBERLAND>

<LADY NORTHUMBERLAND>	<31%>
	O! fly to Scotland,
	Till that the nobles and the armed commons
	Have of their puissance made a little taste.
</LADY NORTHUMBERLAND>

<LADY PERCY>	<32%>
	If they get ground and vantage of the king,
	Then join you with them, like a rib of steel,
	To make strength stronger; but, for all our loves,
	First let them try themselves. So did your son;
	He was so suffer'd: so came I a widow;
	And never shall have length of life enough
	To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes,
	That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven,
	For recordation to my noble husband.
</LADY PERCY>

<NORTHUMBERLAND>	<32%>
	Come, come, go in with me. 'Tis with my mind
	As with the tide swell'd up unto its height,
	That makes a still-stand, running neither way:
	Fain would I go to meet the archbishop,
	But many thousand reasons hold me back.
	I will resolve for Scotland: there am I,
	Till time and vantage crave my company.

	Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,

	And steep my senses in forgetfulness?
	Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,
	Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,
	And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,
	Than in the perfum'd chambers of the great,
	Under the canopies of costly state,
	And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody?
	O thou dull god! why liest thou with the vile
	In loathsome beds, and leav'st the kingly couch
	A watch-case or a common 'larum bell?
	Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
	Seel up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains
	In cradle of the rude imperious surge,
	And in the visitation of the winds,
	Who take the ruffian billows by the top,
	Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them
	With deaf'ning clamour in the slippery clouds,
	That with the hurly death itself awakes?
	Canst thou, O partial sleep! give thy repose
	To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,
	And in the calmest and most stillest night,
	With all appliances and means to boot,
	Deny it to a king? Then, happy low, lie down!

	It is but as a body, yet, distemper'd,

<K. HENRY>	<45%>
	O God! that one might read the book of fate,
	And see the revolution of the times
	Make mountains level, and the continent,—
	Weary of solid firmness,—melt itself
	Into the sea! and, other times, to see
	The beachy girdle of the ocean
	Too wide for Neptune's hips; how chances mock,
	And changes fill the cup of alteration
	With divers liquors! O! if this were seen,
	The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,
	What perils past, what crosses to ensue,
	Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.
	'Tis not ten years gone
	Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,
	Did feast together, and in two years after
	Were they at wars: it is but eight years since
	This Percy was the man nearest my soul,
	Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs
	And laid his love and life under my foot;
	Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard
	Gave him defiance. But which of you was by,—
<STAGE DIR>
<To Warwick.>
</STAGE DIR> You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember,—
	When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,
	Then check'd and rated by Northumberland,
	Did speak these words, now prov'd a prophecy?
	'Northumberland, thou ladder, by the which
	My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne;'
	Though then, God knows, I had no such intent,
	But that necessity so bow'd the state
	That I and greatness were compelled to kiss:
	'The time shall come,' thus did he follow it,
	'The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,
	Shall break into corruption:'—so went on,
	Foretelling this same time's condition
	And the division of our amity.
</K. HENRY>

<WARWICK>	<46%>
	There is a history in all men's lives,
	Figuring the nature of the times deceas'd;
	The which observ'd, a man may prophesy,
	With a near aim, of the main chance of things
	As yet not come to life, which in their seeds
	And weak leginnings lie intreasured.
	Such things become the hatch and brood of time;
	And by the necessary form of this
	King Richard might create a perfect guess
	That great Northumberland, then false to him,
	Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness,
	Which should not find a ground to root upon,
	Unless on you.
</WARWICK>

<K. HENRY>	<47%>

<WARWICK>	<47%>
	It cannot be, my lord!
	Rumour doth double, like the voice and echo,
	The numbers of the fear'd. Please it your Grace
	To go to bed: upon my soul, my lord,
	The powers that you already have sent forth
	Shall bring this prize in very easily.
	To comfort you the more, I have receiv'd
	A certain instance that Glendower is dead.
	Your majesty hath been this fortnight ill,
	And these unseason'd hours perforce must add
	Unto your sickness.

	You were called 'lusty Shallow' then, cousin.

<SHALLOW>	<48%>
	By the mass, I was called any thing; and I would have done any thing indeed too, and roundly too. There was I, and Little John Doit of Staffordshire, and black George Barnes, and Francis Pickbone, and Will Squele a Cotswold man; you had not four such swinge-bucklers in all the inns of court again: and, I may say to you, we knew where the bona-robas were, and had the best of them all at commandment. Then was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a boy, and page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.
</SHALLOW>

<SILENCE>	<48%>
	This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about soldiers?

	The same Sir John, the very same. I saw him break Skogan's head at the court gate, when a' was a crack not thus high: and the very same day did I fight with one Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer, behind Gray's Inn. Jesu!

	It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well said indeed too. 'Better accommodated!' it is good; yea indeed, is it: good phrases are surely and ever were, very commendable. Accommodated! it comes of accommodo: very good; a good phrase.
</SHALLOW>

<BARDOLPH>	<49%>
	Pardon me, sir; I have heard the word. 'Phrase,' call you it? By this good day, I know not the phrase; but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a soldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good command, by heaven. Accommodated; that is, when a man is, as they say, accommodated; or, when a man is, being, whereby, a' may be thought to be accommodated, which is an excellent thing.

	Have you provided me here half a dozen sufficient men?
</FALSTAFF>

<SHALLOW>	<50%>
	Marry, have we, sir. Will you sit?
</SHALLOW>

<FALSTAFF>	<50%>
	Let me see them, I beseech you.
</FALSTAFF>

<SHALLOW>	<50%>
	Where's the roll? where's the roll? where's the roll? Let me see, let me see, let me see. So, so, so, so, so, so, so: yea, marry, sir: Ralph Mouldy! let them appear as I call; let them do so, let them do so. Let me see; where is Mouldy?
</SHALLOW>

<MOULDY>	<50%>
	Here, an't please you.
</MOULDY>

<SHALLOW>	<50%>
	What think you, Sir John? a goodlimbed fellow; young, strong, and of good friends.
</SHALLOW>

<FALSTAFF>	<50%>
	Is thy name Mouldy?

	Ha, ha, ha! most excellent, i' faith! things that are mouldy lack use: very singular good. In faith, well said, Sir John; very well said.
</SHALLOW>

<FALSTAFF>	<50%>
	Prick him.
</FALSTAFF>

<MOULDY>	<50%>
	I was pricked well enough before, an you could have let me alone: my old dame will be undone now for one to do her husbandry and her drudgery: you need not to have pricked me; there are other men fitter to go out than I.
</MOULDY>

<FALSTAFF>	<51%>
	Go to: peace, Mouldy! you shall go. Mouldy, it is time you were spent.

	Peace, fellow, peace! stand aside: know you where you are? For the other, Sir John: let me see. Simon Shadow!

<FALSTAFF>	<51%>
	Yea, marry, let me have him to sit under: he's like to be a cold soldier.

	Where's Shadow?
</SHALLOW>

<SHADOW>	<51%>
	Here, sir.
</SHADOW>

<FALSTAFF>	<51%>
	Shadow, whose son art thou?
</FALSTAFF>

<SHADOW>	<51%>
	My mother's son, sir.
</SHADOW>

<FALSTAFF>	<51%>
	Thy mother's son! like enough, and thy father's shadow: so the son of the female is the shadow of the male: it is often so, indeed; but not of the father's substance.
</FALSTAFF>

<SHALLOW>	<51%>
	Do you like him, Sir John?
</SHALLOW>

<FALSTAFF>	<51%>
	Shadow will serve for summer; prick him, for we have a number of shadows to fill up the muster-book.

<SHALLOW>	<51%>
	Thomas Wart?
</SHALLOW>

<FALSTAFF>	<51%>
	Where's he?

<WART>	<51%>
	Here, sir.
</WART>

<FALSTAFF>	<51%>
	Is thy name Wart?
</FALSTAFF>

<WART>	<51%>
	Yea, sir.
</WART>

<FALSTAFF>	<51%>
	Thou art a very ragged wart.
</FALSTAFF>

<SHALLOW>	<51%>
	Shall I prick him, Sir John?
</SHALLOW>

<FALSTAFF>	<51%>
	It were superfluous; for his apparel is built upon his back, and the whole frame stands upon pins: prick him no more.
</FALSTAFF>

<SHALLOW>	<51%>
	Ha, ha, ha! you can do it, sir; you can do it: I commend you well. Francis Feeble!
</SHALLOW>

	Here, sir.
</FEEBLE>

<FALSTAFF>	<51%>
	What trade art thou, Feeble?
</FALSTAFF>

<FEEBLE>	<51%>
	A woman's tailor, sir.
</FEEBLE>

<SHALLOW>	<51%>
	Shall I prick him, sir?
</SHALLOW>

<FALSTAFF>	<51%>
	You may; but if he had been a man's tailor he'd have pricked you. Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemy's battle as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?
</FALSTAFF>

<FEEBLE>	<52%>
	I will do my good will, sir: you can have no more.
</FEEBLE>

<FALSTAFF>	<52%>
	Well said, good woman's tailor! well said, courageous Feeble! Thou wilt be as valiant as the wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse. Prick the woman's tailor; well, Master Shallow; deep, Master Shallow.
</FALSTAFF>

<FEEBLE>	<52%>
	I would Wart might have gone, sir.
</FEEBLE>

<FALSTAFF>	<52%>
	I would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightst mend him, and make him fit to go. I cannot put him to a private soldier that is the leader of so many thousands: let that suffice, most forcible Feeble.
</FALSTAFF>

<FEEBLE>	<52%>
	It shall suffice, sir.
</FEEBLE>

<FALSTAFF>	<52%>
	I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble.

	What disease hast thou?

	A whoreson cold, sir; a cough, sir, which I caught with ringing in the king's affairs upon his coronation day, sir.
</BULLCALF>

	Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown; we will have away thy cold; and I will take such order that thy friends shall ring for thee. Is here all?

	Here is two more called than your number; you must have but four here, sir: and so, I pray you, go in with me to dinner.
</SHALLOW>

	Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarry dinner. I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow.

	O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night in the windmill in Saint George's fields?

	She never could away with me.

	Never, never; she would always say she could not abide Master Shallow.
</FALSTAFF>

<SHALLOW>	<53%>
	By the mass, I could anger her to the heart. She was then a bona-roba. Doth she hold her own well?
</SHALLOW>

<FALSTAFF>	<53%>
	Old, old, Master Shallow.
</FALSTAFF>

<SHALLOW>	<53%>
	Nay she must be old; she cannot choose but be old; certain she's old; and had Robin Nightwork by old Nightwork before I came to Clement's Inn.

	Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong: they are your likeliest men, and I would have you served with the best.
</SHALLOW>

<FALSTAFF>	<54%>
	Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a man? Care I for the limb, the thewes, the stature, bulk, and big assemblance of a man! Give me the spirit, Master Shallow. Here's Wart; you see what a ragged appearance it is: a' shall charge you and discharge you with the motion of a pewterer's hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets on the brewer's bucket. And this same half-faced fellow, Shadow, give me this man: he presents no mark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great aim level at the edge of a penknife. And, for a retreat; how swiftly will this Feeble the woman's tailor run off! O! give me the spare men, and spare me the great ones. Put me a caliver into Wart's hand, Bardolph.
</FALSTAFF>

<BARDOLPH>	<55%>
	Hold, Wart, traverse; thus, thus, thus.
</BARDOLPH>

<FALSTAFF>	<55%>
	Come, manage me your caliver. So: very well: go to: very good: exceeding good. O, give me always a little, lean, old, chopp'd, bald shot. Well said, i' faith, Wart; thou'rt a good scab: hold, there's a tester for thee.
</FALSTAFF>

<SHALLOW>	<55%>
	He is not his craft's master, he doth not do it right. I remember at Mile-end Green, when I lay at Clement's Inn,—I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's show,—there was a little quiver fellow, and a' would manage you his piece thus: and a' would about and about, and come you in, and come you in; 'rah, tah, tah,' would a' say; 'bounce,' would a' say; and away again would a' go, and again would a' come: I shall never see such a fellow.

	These fellows will do well, Master Shallow. God keep you, Master Silence: I will not use many words with you. Fare you well, gentlemen both: I thank you: I must a dozen mile to-night. Bardolph, give the soldiers coats.

<Exeunt Shallow and Silence.] On, Bardolph; lead the men away. [Exeunt Bardolph, Recruits, &c.>
</STAGE DIR> As I return, I will fetch off these justices: I do see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord! how subject we old men are to this vice of lying. This same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street; and every third word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk's tribute. I do remember him at Clement's Inn like a man made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a' was naked he was for all the world like a forked radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife: a' was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a' was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a monkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a' came ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those tunes to the over-scutched huswives that he heard the carmen whistle, and sware they were his fancies or his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and I'll be sworn a' never saw him but once in the Tilt-yard, and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal's men. I saw it and told John a Gaunt he beat his own name; for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a court; and now has he land and beefs. Well, I will be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall go hard but I will make him a philosopher's two stones to me. If the young dace be a bait for the old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.

<SCROOP>	<57%>
	What is this forest call'd?

	We have sent forth already.
</HASTINGS>

<SCROOP>	<57%>
	'Tis well done.
	My friends and brethren in these great affairs,
	I must acquaint you that I have receiv'd
	New-dated letters from Northumberland;
	Their cold intent, tenour and substance, thus:
	Here doth he wish his person, with such powers
	As might hold sortance with his quality;
	The which he could not levy; whereupon
	He is retir'd, to ripe his growing fortunes,
	To Scotland; and concludes in hearty prayers
	That your attempts may overlive the hazard
	And fearful meeting of their opposite.

<MESSENGER>	<57%>
	West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,
	In goodly form comes on the enemy;
	And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number
	Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand.
</MESSENGER>

<MOWBRAY>	<58%>
	The just proportion that we gave them out.
	Let us sway on and face them in the field.

</MOWBRAY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Westmoreland.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SCROOP>	<58%>
	What well-appointed leader fronts us here?
</SCROOP>

<MOWBRAY>	<58%>
	I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.
</MOWBRAY>

<WESTMORELAND>	<58%>
	Health and fair greeting from our general.
	The Prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.
</WESTMORELAND>

<SCROOP>	<58%>
	Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace,
	What doth concern your coming.
</SCROOP>

<WESTMORELAND>	<58%>
	Then, my lord,
	Unto your Grace do I in chief address
	The substance of my speech. If that rebellion
	Came like itself, in base and abject routs,
	Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,
	And countenanc'd by boys and beggary;
	I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd,
	In his true, native, and most proper shape,
	You, reverend father, and these noble lords
	Had not been here, to dress the ugly form
	Of base and bloody insurrection
	With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,
	Whose see is by a civil peace maintain'd,
	Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,
	Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,
	Whose white investments figure innocence,
	The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,
	Wherefore do you so ill translate yourself
	Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace
	Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;
	Turning your books to greaves, your ink to blood,
	Your pens to lances, and your tongue divine
	To a loud trumpet and a point of war?
</WESTMORELAND>

<SCROOP>	<59%>
	Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.
	Briefly to this end: we are all diseas'd;
	And, with our surfeiting and wanton hours
	Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,
	And we must bleed for it: of which disease
	Our late king, Richard, being infected, died.
	But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,
	I take not on me here as a physician,
	Nor do I as an enemy to peace
	Troop in the throngs of military men;
	But rather show a while like fearful war,
	To diet rank minds sick of happiness
	And purge the obstructions which begin to stop
	Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly:
	I have in equal balance justly weigh'd
	What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,
	And find our griefs heavier than our offences.
	We see which way the stream of time doth run
	And are enforc'd from our most quiet sphere
	By the rough torrent of occasion;
	And have the summary of all our griefs,
	When time shall serve, to show in articles,
	Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,
	And might by no suit gain our audience.
	When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,
	We are denied access unto his person
	Even by those men that most have done us wrong.
	The dangers of the days but newly gone,—
	Whose memory is written on the earth
	With yet appearing blood,—and the examples
	Of every minute's instance, present now,
	Have put us in these ill-beseeming arms;
	Not to break peace, or any branch of it,
	But to establish here a peace indeed,
	Concurring both in name and quality.
</SCROOP>

<WESTMORELAND>	<59%>
	When ever yet was your appeal denied?
	Wherein have you been galled by the king?
	What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you,
	That you should seal this lawless bloody book
	Of forg'd rebellion with a seal divine,
	And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?
</WESTMORELAND>

<SCROOP>	<60%>
	My brother general, the commonwealth,
	To brother born an household cruelty,
	I make my quarrel in particular.
</SCROOP>

<WESTMORELAND>	<60%>
	There is no need of any such redress;
	Or if there were, it not belongs to you.
</WESTMORELAND>

<MOWBRAY>	<60%>
	Why not to him in part, and to us all
	That feel the bruises of the days before,
	And suffer the condition of these times
	To lay a heavy and unequal hand
	Upon our honours?
</MOWBRAY>

<WESTMORELAND>	<60%>
	O! my good Lord Mowbray,
	Construe the times to their necessities,
	And you shall say indeed, it is the time,
	And not the king, that doth you injuries.
	Yet, for your part, it not appears to me
	Either from the king or in the present time
	That you should have an inch of any ground
	To build a grief on: were you not restor'd
	To all the Duke of Norfolk's signories,
	Your noble and right well-remember'd father's?
</WESTMORELAND>

<MOWBRAY>	<60%>
	What thing, in honour, had my father lost,
	That need to be reviv'd and breath'd in me?
	The king that lov'd him as the state stood then,
	Was force perforce compell'd to banish him:
	And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,
	Being mounted and both roused in their seats,
	Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,
	Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,
	Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel,
	And the loud trumpet blowing them together,
	Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd
	My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,
	O! when the king did throw his warder down,
	His own life hung upon the staff he threw;
	Then threw he down himself and all their lives
	That by indictment and by dint of sword
	Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.
</MOWBRAY>

<WESTMORELAND>	<61%>
	You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.
	The Earl of Hereford was reputed then
	In England the most valiant gentleman:
	Who knows on whom Fortune would then have smil'd?
	But if your father had been victor there,
	He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry;
	For all the country in a general voice
	Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love
	Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on
	And bless'd and grac'd indeed, more than the king.
	But this is mere digression from my purpose.
	Here come I from our princely general
	To know your griefs; to tell you from his Grace
	That he will give you audience; and wherein
	It shall appear that your demands are just,
	You shall enjoy them; every thing set off
	That might so much as think you enemies.
</WESTMORELAND>

<MOWBRAY>	<61%>
	But he hath forc'd us to compel this offer,
	And it proceeds from policy, not love.
</MOWBRAY>

<WESTMORELAND>	<61%>
	Mowbray, you overween to take it so.
	This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:
	For, lo! within a ken our army lies
	Upon mine honour, all too confident
	To give admittance to a thought of fear.
	Our battle is more full of names than yours,
	Our men more perfect in the use of arms,
	Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;
	Then reason will our hearts should be as good:
	Say you not then our offer is compell'd.
</WESTMORELAND>

<MOWBRAY>	<61%>
	Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.
</MOWBRAY>

<WESTMORELAND>	<61%>
	That argues but the shame of your offence:
	A rotten case abides no handling.
</WESTMORELAND>

	Acquitted by a true substantial form

	And knit our powers to the arm of peace.

	This will I show the general. Please you, lords,
	In sight of both our battles we may meet;

	Fear you not that: if we can make our peace

<MOWBRAY>	<62%>
	Yea, but our valuation shall be such
	That every slight and false-derived cause,

	Shall to the king taste of this action;
	That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,
	We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind
	That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff
	And good from bad find no partition.

<SCROOP>	<63%>
	No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary
	Of dainty and such picking grievances:
	For he hath found to end one doubt by death
	Revives two greater in the heirs of life;
	And therefore will he wipe his tables clean,
	And keep no tell-tale to his memory
	That may repeat and history his loss
	To new remembrance; for full well he knows
	He cannot so precisely weed this land
	As his misdoubts present occasion:
	His foes are so enrooted with his friends
	That, plucking to unfix an enemy,
	He doth unfasten so and shake a friend.
	So that this land, like an offensive wife,
	That hath enrag'd him on to offer strokes,
	As he is striking, holds his infant up
	And hangs resolv'd correction in the arm
	That was uprear'd to execution.

<HASTINGS>	<63%>
	Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods
	On late offenders, that he now doth lack

	So that his power, like to a fangless lion,
	May offer, but not hold.
</HASTINGS>

<SCROOP>	<63%>
	'Tis very true:

	You are well encounter'd here, my cousin Mowbray:
	Good day to you, gentle lord archbishop;
	And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.
	My Lord of York, it better show'd with you,
	When that your flock, assembled by the bell,
	Encircled you to hear with reverence
	Your exposition on the holy text
	Than now to see you here an iron man,
	Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,
	Turning the word to sword and life to death.
	That man that sits within a monarch's heart
	And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,
	Would he abuse the countenance of the king,
	Alack! what mischief might he set abroach
	In shadow of such greatness. With you, lord bishop,
	It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken
	How deep you were within the books of God?
	To us, the speaker in his parliament;
	To us the imagin'd voice of God himself;
	The very opener and intelligencer
	Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven,
	And our dull workings. O! who shall believe
	But you misuse the reverence of your place,
	Employ the countenance and grace of heaven,
	As a false favourite doth his prince's name,
	In deeds dishonourable? You have taken up,
	Under the counterfeited zeal of God,
	The subjects of his substitute, my father;
	And both against the peace of heaven and him
	Have here upswarm'd them.
</LANCASTER>

<SCROOP>	<64%>
	Good my Lord of Lancaster,
	I am not here against your father's peace;
	But, as I told my Lord of Westmoreland,
	The time misorder'd doth, in common sense,
	Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,
	To hold our safety up. I sent your Grace
	The parcels and particulars of our grief,—
	The which hath been with scorn shov'd from the court,—
	Whereon this Hydra son of war is born;
	Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep
	With grant of our most just and right desires,
	And true obedience, of this madness cur'd,
	Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.

	My father's purposes have been mistook,
	And some about him have too lavishly
	Wrested his meaning and authority.
	My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress'd;
	Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,
	Discharge your powers unto their several counties,
	As we will ours: and here between the armies
	Let's drink together friendly and embrace,

I have speeded hither with the very extremest inch of possibility; I have foundered nine score and odd posts; and here, travel-tainted as I am, have, in my pure and immaculate valour, taken Sir John Colevile of the dale, a most furious knight and valorous enemy. But what of that? he saw me, and yielded; that I may justly say with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome, 'I came, saw, and overcame.'

To the which course if I be enforced, if you do not all show like gilt two-pences to me, and I in the clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full moon doth the cinders of the element, which show like pins' heads to her, believe not the word of the noble.

	I would you had but the wit: 'twere better than your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine. There's never none of these demure boys come to any proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood, and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a kind of male green-sickness; and then, when they marry, they get wenches. They are generally fools and cowards, which some of us should be too but for inflammation. A good sherris-sack hath a two-fold operation in it. It ascends me into the brain; dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes; which, deliver'd o'er to the voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The second property of your excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood; which, before cold and settled, left the liver white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice: but the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extreme. It illumineth the face, which, as a beacon, gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom, man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain, the heart, who, great and puffed up with this retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and leaining, a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack commences it and sets it in act and use. Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father, he hath, like lean, sterile, and bare land, manured, husbanded, and tilled, with excellent endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If I had a thousand sons, the first human principle I would teach them should be, to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack.

</CLARENCE>

<K. HENRY>	<73%>
	Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.
	How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother?
	He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas;
	Thou hast a better place in his affection
	Than all thy brothers: cherish it, my boy,
	And noble offices thou mayst effect
	Of mediation, after I am dead,
	Between his greatness and thy other brethren:
	Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,
	Nor lose the good advantage of his grace
	By seeming cold or careless of his will;
	For he is gracious, if he be observ'd:
	He hath a tear for pity and a hand
	Open as day for melting charity;
	Yet, notwithstanding, being incens'd, he's flint;
	As humorous as winter, and as sudden
	As flaws congealed in the spring of day.
	His temper therefore must be well observ'd:
	Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,
	When you perceive his blood inclin'd to mirth;
	But, being moody, give him line and scope,
	Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,
	Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,
	And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,
	A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,
	That the united vessel of their blood,
	Mingled with venom of suggestion—
	As, force perforce, the age will pour it in—
	Shall never leak, though it do work as strong
	As aconitum or rash gunpowder.

	Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;

	The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape
	In forms imaginary the unguided days
	And rotten times that you shall look upon
	When I am sleeping with my ancestors.
	For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,
	When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,

	O! with what wings shall his affections fly

	Be look'd upon, and learn'd; which once attain'd,
	Your highness knows, comes to no further use
	But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,
	The prince will in the perfectness of time
	Cast off his followers; and their memory
	Shall as a pattern or a measure live,
	By which his Grace must mete the lives of others,
	Turning past evils to advantages.

	So many English kings. Thy due from me

<PRINCE>	<79%>
	I never thought to hear you speak again.
</PRINCE>

<K. HENRY>	<79%>
	Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought:
	I stay too long by thee, I weary thee.
	Dost thou so hunger for my empty chair
	That thou wilt needs invest thee with mine honours
	Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth!
	Thou seek'st the greatness that will overwhelm thee.
	Stay but a little; for my cloud of dignity
	Is held from falling with so weak a wind
	That it will quickly drop: my day is dim.
	Thou hast stol'n that which after some few hours
	Were thine without offence; and at my death
	Thou hast seal'd up my expectation:
	Thy life did manifest thou lov'dst me not,
	And thou wilt have me die assur'd of it.
	Thou hid'st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,
	Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,
	To stab at half an hour of my life.
	What! canst thou not forbear me half an hour?
	Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,
	And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
	That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.
	Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
	Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head:
	Only compound me with forgotten dust;
	Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.
	Pluck down my officers, break my decrees;
	For now a time is come to mock at form.
	Harry the Fifth is crown'd! Up, vanity!
	Down, royal state! all you sage counsellors, hence!
	And to the English court assemble now,
	From every region, apes of idleness!
	Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum:
	Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance,
	Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit
	The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?
	Be happy, he will trouble you no more:
	England shall double gild his treble guilt.
	England shall give him office, honour, might;
	For the fifth Harry from curb'd licence plucks
	The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog
	Shall flesh his tooth in every innocent.
	O my poor kingdom! sick with civil blows.
	When that my care could not withhold thy riots,
	What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?
	O! thou wilt be a wilderness again,
	Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants.
</K. HENRY>

<PRINCE>	<80%>
	O! pardon me, my liege; but for my tears,
	The moist impediments unto my speech,
	I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke
	Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
	The course of it so far. There is your crown;
	And he that wears the crown immortally
	Long guard it yours! If I affect it more
	Than as your honour and as your renown,
	Let me no more from this obedience rise,—
	Which my most true and inward duteous spirit
	Teacheth,—this prostrate and exterior bending.
	God witness with me, when I here came in,
	And found no course of breath within your majesty,
	How cold it struck my heart! if I do feign,
	O! let me in my present wildness die
	And never live to show the incredulous world
	The noble change that I have purposed.
	Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,
	And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,
	I spake unto the crown as having sense,
	And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending
	Hath fed upon the body of my father;
	Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:
	Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,
	Preserving life in medicine potable:
	But thou most fine, most honour'd, most renown'd,
	Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,
	Accusing it, I put it on my head,
	To try with it, as with an enemy
	That had before my face murder'd my father,
	The quarrel of a true inheritor.
	But if it did infect my blood with joy,
	Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;
	If any rebel or vain spirit of mine
	Did with the least affection of a welcome
	Give entertainment to the might of it,
	Let God for ever keep it from my head,
	And make me as the poorest vassal is
	That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!
</PRINCE>

<K. HENRY>	<81%>
	O my son!
	God put it in thy mind to take it hence,
	That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,
	Pleading so wisely in excuse of it.
	Come hither, Harry: sit thou by my bed;
	And hear, I think, the very latest counsel
	That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,
	By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways
	I met this crown; and I myself know well
	How troublesome it sat upon my head:
	To thee it shall descend with better quiet,
	Better opinion, better confirmation;
	For all the soil of the achievement goes
	With me into the earth. It seem'd in me
	But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,
	And I had many living to upbraid
	My gain of it by their assistances;
	Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,
	Wounding supposed peace. All these bold fears
	Thou seest with peril I have answered;
	For all my reign hath been but as a scene
	Acting that argument; and now my death
	Changes the mode: for what in me was purchas'd,
	Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;
	So thou the garment wear'st successively.
	Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,
	Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;
	And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,
	Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;
	By whose fell working I was first advanc'd,
	And by whose power I well might lodge a fear
	To be again displac'd: which to avoid,
	I cut them off; and had a purpose now
	To lead out many to the Holy Land,
	Lest rest and lying still might make them look
	Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,
	Be it thy course to busy giddy minds
	With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,
	May waste the memory of the former days.
	More would I, but my lungs are wasted so
	That strength of speech is utterly denied me.
	How I came by the crown, O God, forgive!
	And grant it may with thee in true peace live.
</K. HENRY>

<PRINCE>	<83%>
	My gracious liege,

I have served your worship truly, sir, this eight years; and if I cannot once or twice in a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I have but a very little credit with your worship.

If I were sawed into quantities, I should make four dozen of such bearded hermit's staves as Master Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his: they, by observing him, do bear themselves like foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is turned into a justice-like serving-man. Their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent, like so many wild-geese. If I had a suit to Master Shallow, I would humour his men with the imputation of being near their master: if to his men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man could better command his servants. It is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught, as men take diseases, one of another: therefore let men take heed of their company. I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions,—which is four terms, or two actions,—and a' shall laugh without intervallums. O! it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders. O! you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up!

<CH. JUSTICE>	<87%>
	Good morrow, and God save your majesty!
</CH. JUSTICE>

<K. HENRY>	<87%>
	This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,
	Sits not so easy on me as you think.
	Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear:
	This is the English, not the Turkish court;
	Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
	But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers,
	For, to speak truth, it very well becomes you:
	Sorrow so royally in you appears
	That I will deeply put the fashion on
	And wear it in my heart. Why then, be sad;
	But entertain no more of it, good brothers,
	Than a joint burden laid upon us all.
	For me, by heaven, I bid you be assur'd,
	I'll be your father and your brother too;
	Let me but bear your love, I'll bear your cares:
	Yet weep that Harry's dead, and so will I;
	But Harry lives that shall convert those tears
	By number into hours of happiness.
</K. HENRY>

<LANCASTER ETC.>	<88%>
	We hope no other from your majesty.
</LANCASTER ETC.>

<K. HENRY>	<88%>
	You all look strangely on me: <STAGE DIR>
<To the Chief Justice.>
</STAGE DIR> and you most;
	You are, I think, assur'd I love you not.
</K. HENRY>

<CH. JUSTICE>	<88%>
	I am assur'd, if I be measur'd rightly,
	Your majesty hath no just cause to hate me.
</CH. JUSTICE>

<K. HENRY>	<88%>
	No!
	How might a prince of my great hopes forget
	So great indignities you laid upon me?
	What! rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison
	The immediate heir of England! Was this easy?
	May this be wash'd in Lethe, and forgotten?
</K. HENRY>

<CH. JUSTICE>	<88%>
	I then did use the person of your father;
	The image of his power lay then in me:
	And, in the administration of his law,
	Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,
	Your highness pleased to forget my place,
	The majesty and power of law and justice,
	The image of the king whom I presented,
	And struck me in my very seat of judgment;
	Whereon, as an offender to your father,
	I gave bold way to my authority,
	And did commit you. If the deed were ill,
	Be you contented, wearing now the garland,
	To have a son set your decrees at nought,
	To pluck down justice from your awful bench,
	To trip the course of law, and blunt the sword
	That guards the peace and safety of your person:
	Nay, more, to spurn at your most royal image
	And mock your workings in a second body.
	Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;
	Be now the father and propose a son,
	Hear your own dignity so much profan'd,
	See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,
	Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd;
	And then imagine me taking your part,
	And in your power soft silencing your son:
	After this cold considerance, sentence me;
	And, as you are a king, speak in your state
	What I have done that misbecame my place,
	My person, or my liege's sov'reignty.
</CH. JUSTICE>

<K. HENRY>	<89%>
	You are right, justice; and you weigh this well;
	Therefore still bear the balance and the sword:
	And I do wish your honours may increase
	Till you do live to see a son of mine
	Offend you and obey you, as I did.
	So shall I live to speak my father's words:
	'Happy am I, that have a man so bold
	That dares do justice on my proper son;
	And not less happy, having such a son,
	That would deliver up his greatness so
	Into the hands of justice.' You did commit me:
	For which, I do commit into your hand
	The unstained sword that you have us'd to bear;
	With this remembrance, that you use the same
	With the like bold, just, and impartial spirit
	As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand:
	You shall be as a father to my youth;
	My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,
	And I will stoop and humble my intents
	To your well-practis'd wise directions.
	And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;
	My father is gone wild into his grave,
	For in his tomb lie my affections;
	And with his spirit sadly I survive,
	To mock the expectation of the world,
	To frustrate prophecies, and to raze out
	Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down
	After my seeming. The tide of blood in me
	Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now:
	Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,
	Where it shall mingle with the state of floods
	And flow henceforth in formal majesty.
	Now call we our high court of parliament;
	And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,
	That the great body of our state may go
	In equal rank with the best govern'd nation;
	That war or peace, or both at once, may be
	As things acquainted and familiar to us;
	In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.
	Our coronation done, we will accite,
	As I before remember'd, all our state:
	And, God consigning to my good intents,
	No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,
	God shorten Harry's happy life one day.

	I like this fair proceeding of the king's.
	He hath intent his wonted followers
	Shall all be very well provided for;
	But all are banish'd till their conversations
	Appear more wise and modest to the world.

	I will lay odds, that, ere this year expire,

	Come, will you hence?

<Spoken by a>

<Dancer.>
	First, my fear; then, my curtsy; last my speech. My fear is, your displeasure, my curtsy, my duty, and my speech, to beg your pardon. If you look for a good speech now, you undo me; for what I have to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring. But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it known to you,—as it is very well,—I was lately here in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better. I did mean indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here, I promised you I would be, and here I commit my body to your mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some; and, as most debtors do, promise you infinitely.
	If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a good conscience will make any possible satisfaction, and so will I. All the gentlewomen here have forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which was never seen before in such an assembly.
	One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for anything I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat, unless already a' be killed with your hard opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen.
