<SCENE 1>
<London. A Street.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Gloucester.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<0%>
	Now is the winter of our discontent
	Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
	And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
	In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
	Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
	Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
	Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings;
	Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
	Grim-visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
	And now,—instead of mounting barbed steeds,
	To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,—
	He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
	To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
	But I, that am not shap'd for sportive tricks,
	Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
	I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
	To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
	I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
	Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
	Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time
	Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
	And that so lamely and unfashionable
	That dogs bark at me, as I halt by them;
	Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
	Have no delight to pass away the time,
	Unless to see my shadow in the sun
	And descant on mine own deformity:
	And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
	To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
	I am determined to prove a villain,
	And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
	Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
	By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,
	To set my brother Clarence and the king
	In deadly hate the one against the other:
	And if King Edward be as true and just
	As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,
	This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
	About a prophecy, which says, that G
	Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
	Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here Clarence comes.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Clarence, guarded, and Brakenbury.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Brother, good day: what means this armed guard
</GLOUCESTER>
	That waits upon your Grace?
<CLARENCE>	<1%>
	His majesty,
	Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
	This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
</CLARENCE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<1%>
	Upon what cause?
</GLOUCESTER>

<CLARENCE>	<1%>
	Because my name is George.
</CLARENCE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<1%>
	Alack! my lord, that fault is none of yours;
	He should, for that, commit your godfathers.
	O! belike his majesty hath some intent
	That you should be new-christen'd in the Tower.
	But what's the matter, Clarence? may I know?
</GLOUCESTER>

<CLARENCE>	<2%>
	Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
	As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
	He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
	And from the cross-row plucks the letter G,
	And says a wizard told him that by G
	His issue disinherited should be;
	And, for my name of George begins with G,
	It follows in his thought that I am he.
	These, as I learn, and such like toys as these,
	Have mov'd his highness to commit me now.
</CLARENCE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<2%>
	Why, this it is, when men are rul'd by women:
	'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower;
	My Lady Grey, his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
	That tempers him to this extremity.
	Was it not she and that good man of worship,
	Antony Woodville, her brother there,
	That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
	From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
	We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
</GLOUCESTER>

<CLARENCE>	<2%>
	By heaven, I think there is no man secure
	But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
	That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
	Heard you not what a humble suppliant
	Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?
</CLARENCE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<2%>
	Humbly complaining to her deity
	Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
	I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,
	If we will keep in favour with the king,
	To be her men and wear her livery:
	The jealous o'er-worn widow and herself,
	Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen,
	Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.
</GLOUCESTER>

<BRAKENBURY>	<2%>
	I beseech your Graces both to pardon me;
	His majesty hath straitly given in charge
	That no man shall have private conference,
	Of what degree soever, with your brother.
</BRAKENBURY>

<GLOUCESTER>	<2%>
	Even so; an please your worship, Brakenbury,
	You may partake of anything we say:
	We speak no treason, man: we say the king
	Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
	Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
	We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
	A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
	And that the queen's kindred are made gentlefolks.
	How say you, sir? can you deny all this?
</GLOUCESTER>

<BRAKENBURY>	<3%>
	With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.
</BRAKENBURY>

<GLOUCESTER>	<3%>
	Naught to do with Mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
	He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
	Were best to do it secretly, alone.
</GLOUCESTER>

<BRAKENBURY>	<3%>
	What one, my lord?
</BRAKENBURY>

<GLOUCESTER>	<3%>
	Her husband, knave. Wouldst thou betray me?
</GLOUCESTER>

<BRAKENBURY>	<3%>
	I beseech your Grace to pardon me; and withal
	Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
</BRAKENBURY>

<CLARENCE>	<3%>
	We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
</CLARENCE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<3%>
	We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
	Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
	And whatsoe'er you will employ me in,
	Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,
	I will perform it to enfranchise you.
	Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
	Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
</GLOUCESTER>

<CLARENCE>	<3%>
	I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
</CLARENCE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<3%>
	Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
	I will deliver you, or else lie for you:
	Meantime, have patience.
</GLOUCESTER>

<CLARENCE>	<3%>
	I must perforce: farewell.
</CLARENCE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Clarence, Brakenbury, and Guard.>
</STAGE DIR>

<GLOUCESTER>	<3%>
	Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return,
	Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so
	That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
	If heaven will take the present at our hands.
	But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings!

</GLOUCESTER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Hastings.>
</STAGE DIR>
<HASTINGS>	<3%>
	Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
</HASTINGS>

<GLOUCESTER>	<3%>
	As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
	Well are you welcome to this open air.
	How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
</GLOUCESTER>

<HASTINGS>	<3%>
	With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
	But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
	That were the cause of my imprisonment.
</HASTINGS>

<GLOUCESTER>	<4%>
	No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
	For they that were your enemies are his,
	And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
</GLOUCESTER>

<HASTINGS>	<4%>
	More pity that the eagles should be mew'd,
	While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
</HASTINGS>

<GLOUCESTER>	<4%>
	What news abroad?
</GLOUCESTER>

<HASTINGS>	<4%>
	No news so bad abroad as this at home;
	The king is sickly, weak, and melancholy,
	And his physicians fear him mightily.
</HASTINGS>

<GLOUCESTER>	<4%>
	Now by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
	O! he hath kept an evil diet long,
	And over-much consum'd his royal person:
	'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
	What, is he in his bed?
</GLOUCESTER>

<HASTINGS>	<4%>
	He is.
</HASTINGS>

<GLOUCESTER>	<4%>
	Go you before, and I will follow you.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Hastings.>
</STAGE DIR>
	He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
	Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
	I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
	With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
	And, if I fail not in my deep intent,
	Clarence hath not another day to live:
	Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
	And leave the world for me to bustle in!
	For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
	What though I kill'd her husband and her father,
	The readiest way to make the wench amends
	Is to become her husband and her father:
	The which will I; not all so much for love
	As for another secret close intent,
	By marrying her, which I must reach unto.
	But yet I run before my horse to market:
	Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
	When they are gone, then must I count my gains.
</GLOUCESTER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

</SCENE 1>


<SCENE 2>
<London. Another Street.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter the corpse of King Henry the Sixth, borne in...>
<... an open coffin; Gentlemen bearing halberds to guard it; and Lady Anne, as mourner.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ANNE>	<5%>
	Set down, set down your honourable load,
	If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
	Whilst I a while obsequiously lament
	The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
	Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
	Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
	Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
	Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
	To hear the lamentations of poor Anne,
	Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,
	Stabb'd by the self-same hand that made these wounds!
	Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
	I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
	O! cursed be the hand that made these holes;
	Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it!
	Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
	More direful hap betide that hated wretch,
	That makes us wretched by the death of thee,
	Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
	Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
	If ever he have child, abortive be it,
	Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
	Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
	May fright the hopeful mother at the view;
	And that be heir to his unhappiness!
	If ever he have wife, let her be made
	More miserable by the death of him
	Than I am made by my young lord and thee!
	Come, now toward Chertsey with your holy load,
	Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
	And still, as you are weary of the weight,
	Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.
<STAGE DIR>
<The Bearers take up the corpse and advance.>
</STAGE DIR>

</ANNE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Gloucester.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<5%>
	Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<5%>
	What black magician conjures up this fiend,
	To stop devoted charitable deeds?
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<5%>
	Villains! set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
	I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.
</GLOUCESTER>

<GENTLEMAN 1>	<5%>
	My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.
</GENTLEMAN 1>

<GLOUCESTER>	<5%>
	Unmanner'd dog! stand thou when I command:
	Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,
	Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
	And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
</GLOUCESTER>
<STAGE DIR>
<The Bearers set down the coffin.>
</STAGE DIR>

<ANNE>	<6%>
	What! do you tremble? are you all afraid?
	Alas! I blame you not; for you are mortal,
	And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
	Avaunt! thou dreadful minister of hell,
	Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
	His soul thou canst not have: therefore, be gone.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<6%>
	Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<6%>
	Foul devil, for God's sake hence, and trouble us not;
	For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
	Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
	If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
	Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
	O! gentlemen; see, see! dead Henry's wounds
	Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh.
	Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity,
	For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
	From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells:
	Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
	Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
	O God! which this blood mad'st, revenge his death;
	O earth! which this blood drink'st, revenge his death;
	Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead,
	Or earth, gape open wide, and eat him quick,
	As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood,
	Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<6%>
	Lady, you know no rules of charity,
	Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<6%>
	Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
	No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<6%>
	But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<6%>
	O! wonderful, when devils tell the truth.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<6%>
	More wonderful when angels are so angry.
	Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
	Of these supposed evils, to give me leave,
	By circumstance, but to acquit myself.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<7%>
	Vouchsafe, diffus'd infection of a man,
	For these known evils, but to give me leave,
	By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<7%>
	Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
	Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<7%>
	Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
	No excuse current, but to hang thyself.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<7%>
	By such despair I should accuse myself.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<7%>
	And by despairing shouldst thou stand excus'd
	For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
	Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<7%>
	Say that I slew them not.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<7%>
	Then say they were not slain:
	But dead they are, and, devilish slave, by thee.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<7%>
	I did not kill your husband.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<7%>
	Why, then he is alive.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<7%>
	Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<7%>
	In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
	Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;
	The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
	But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<7%>
	I was provoked by her sland'rous tongue,
	That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<7%>
	Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,
	That never dreamt on aught but butcheries.
	Didst thou not kill this king?
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<7%>
	I grant ye.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<7%>
	Dost grant me, hedge-hog? Then, God grant me too
	Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
	O! he was gentle, mild, and virtuous.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<7%>
	The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<7%>
	He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<7%>
	Let him thank me, that help'd to send him thither;
	For he was fitter for that place than earth.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<7%>
	And thou unfit for any place but hell.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<7%>
	Yes, one place else, if you will bear me name it.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<7%>
	Some dungeon.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<7%>
	Your bed-chamber.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<8%>
	Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<8%>
	So will it, madam, till I lie with you.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<8%>
	I hope so.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<8%>
	I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
	To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
	And fall somewhat into a slower method,
	Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
	Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
	As blameful as the executioner?
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<8%>
	Thou wast the cause, and most accurs'd effect.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<8%>
	Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
	Your beauty, that did haunt me in my sleep
	To undertake the death of all the world,
	So might I live one hour in your sweet bosom.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<8%>
	If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
	These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<8%>
	These eyes could not endure that beauty's wrack;
	You should not blemish it if I stood by:
	As all the world is cheered by the sun,
	So I by that; it is my day, my life.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<8%>
	Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<8%>
	Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<8%>
	I would I were, to be reveng'd on thee.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<8%>
	It is a quarrel most unnatural,
	To be reveng'd on him that loveth thee.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<8%>
	It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
	To be reveng'd on him that kill'd my husband.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<8%>
	He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
	Did it to help thee to a better husband.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<8%>
	His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<8%>
	He lives that loves thee better than he could.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<8%>
	Name him.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<8%>
	Plantagenet.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<8%>
	Why, that was he.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<8%>
	The self-same name, but one of better nature.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<8%>
	Where is he?
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<8%>
	Here. <STAGE DIR>
<She spitteth at him.>
</STAGE DIR> Why dost thou spit at me?
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<8%>
	Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<8%>
	Never came poison from so sweet a place.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<9%>
	Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
	Out of my sight! thou dost infect mine eyes.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<9%>
	Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<9%>
	Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<9%>
	I would they were, that I might die at once;
	For now they kill me with a living death.
	Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
	Sham'd their aspects with store of childish drops;
	These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear;
	No, when my father York and Edward wept
	To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
	When black-fac'd Clifford shook his sword at him;
	Nor when thy war-like father like a child,
	Told the sad story of my father's death,
	And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
	That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks,
	Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time,
	My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
	And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
	Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
	I never su'd to friend, nor enemy;
	My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing words;
	But, now thy beauty is propos'd my fee,
	My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
<STAGE DIR>
<She looks scornfully at him.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Teach not thy lip such scorn, for it was made
	For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
	If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
	Lo! here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
	Which if thou please to hide in this true breast,
	And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
	I lay it open to the deadly stroke,
	And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
<STAGE DIR>
<He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry;
	But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
	Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward;
<STAGE DIR>
<She again offers at his breast.>
</STAGE DIR>
	But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
<STAGE DIR>
<She lets fall the sword.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Take up the sword again, or take up me.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<10%>
	Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
	I will not be thy executioner.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<10%>
	Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<10%>
	I have already.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<10%>
	That was in thy rage:
	Speak it again, and, even with the word,
	This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,
	Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love:
	To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<10%>
	I would I knew thy heart.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<10%>
	'Tis figur'd in my tongue.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<10%>
	I fear me both are false.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<10%>
	Then never man was true.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<10%>
	Well, well, put up your sword.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<10%>
	Say, then, my peace is made.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<10%>
	That shalt thou know hereafter.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<10%>
	But shall I live in hope?
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<10%>
	All men, I hope, live so.
</ANNE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<10%>
	Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
</GLOUCESTER>

<ANNE>	<10%>
	To take is not to give.
</ANNE>
<STAGE DIR>
<She puts on the ring.>
</STAGE DIR>

<GLOUCESTER>	<10%>
	Look, how my ring encompasseth thy finger,
	Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
	Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
	And if thy poor devoted servant may
	But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,

	Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
	Was ever woman in this humour won?
	I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
	What! I, that kill'd her husband, and his father,
	To take her in her heart's extremest hate;
	With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
	The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
	Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me,
	And nothing I to back my suit withal
	But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
	And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
	Ha!
	Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
	Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
	Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
	A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
	Fram'd in the prodigality of nature,
	Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
	The spacious world cannot again afford:
	And will she yet abase her eyes on me,
	That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
	And made her widow to a woeful bed?
	On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
	On me, that halt and am misshapen thus?
	My dukedom to a beggarly denier
	I do mistake my person all this while:
	Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
	Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
	I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
	And entertain a score or two of tailors,
	To study fashions to adorn my body:
	Since I am crept in favour with myself,
	I will maintain it with some little cost.
	But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave,
	And then return lamenting to my love.
	Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
	That I may see my shadow as I pass.

	They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:
	Who are they that complain unto the king,
	That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?
	By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly
	That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
	Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
	Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive, and cog,
	Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
	I must be held a rancorous enemy.
	Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
	But thus his simple truth must be abus'd
	By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
</GLOUCESTER>

<GREY>	<13%>

	Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.

	That in your outward action shows itself
	Against my children, brothers, and myself,
	Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
	The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.
</Q. ELIZABETH>

<GLOUCESTER>	<14%>
	I cannot tell; the world is grown so bad
	That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:

<GLOUCESTER>	<14%>
	Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:
	Our brother is imprison'd by your means,
	Myself disgrac'd, and the nobility
	Held in contempt; while great promotions
	Are daily given to ennoble those
	That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.
</GLOUCESTER>

<Q. ELIZABETH>	<14%>
	By him that rais'd me to this careful height
	From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,

	My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne

<GLOUCESTER>	<20%>
	I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
	The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
	I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
	Clarence, whom I, indeed, have cast in darkness,
	I do beweep to many simple gulls;
	Namely, to Stanley, Hastings, Buckingham;
	And tell them 'tis the queen and her allies
	That stir the king against the duke my brother.
	Now they believe it; and withal whet me
	To be reveng'd on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey;
	But then I sigh, and, with a piece of scripture,
	Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
	And thus I clothe my naked villany
	With odd old ends stol'n forth of holy writ,
	And seem a saint when most I play the devil.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter two Murderers.>
</STAGE DIR>
	But soft! here come my executioners.
	How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!
</GLOUCESTER>
	Are you now going to dispatch this thing?
<MURDERER 1>	<21%>
	We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant,
	That we may be admitted where he is.
</MURDERER 1>

<GLOUCESTER>	<21%>
	Well thought upon; I have it here about me:
<STAGE DIR>
<Gives the warrant.>
</STAGE DIR>
	When you have done, repair to Crosby-place.
	But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
	Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
	For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
	May move your hearts to pity, if you mark him.
</GLOUCESTER>

<MURDERER 1>	<21%>
	Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to prate;
	Talkers are no good doers: be assur'd
	We go to use our hands and not our tongues.
</MURDERER 1>

	I like you, lads; about your business straight;

<SCENE 4>
<The Same. The Tower.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Clarence and Brakenbury.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BRAKENBURY>	<21%>
	Why looks your Grace so heavily to-day?
</BRAKENBURY>

<CLARENCE>	<21%>
	O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
	So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
	That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
	I would not spend another such a night,
	Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
	So full of dismal terror was the time.
</CLARENCE>

<BRAKENBURY>	<21%>
	What was your dream, my lord? I pray you, tell me.
</BRAKENBURY>

<CLARENCE>	<21%>
	Methought that I had broken from the Tower,
	And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
	And in my company my brother Gloucester,
	Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
	Upon the hatches: thence we look'd toward England,
	And cited up a thousand heavy times,
	During the wars of York and Lancaster,
	That had befall'n us. As we pac'd along
	Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
	Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
	Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
	Into the tumbling billows of the main.
	Lord, Lord! methought what pain it was to drown:
	What dreadful noise of water in mine ears!
	What sights of ugly death within mine eyes!
	Methought I saw a thousand fearful wracks;
	A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
	Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
	Inestimable stones, unvalu'd jewels,
	All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea.
	Some lay in dead men's skulls; and in those holes
	Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
	As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
	That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
	And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.
</CLARENCE>

<BRAKENBURY>	<22%>
	Had you such leisure in the time of death
	To gaze upon those secrets of the deep?
</BRAKENBURY>

<CLARENCE>	<22%>
	Methought I had; and often did I strive
	To yield the ghost; but still the envious flood
	Stopt in my soul, and would not let it forth
	To find the empty, vast, and wandering air;
	But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
	Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.
</CLARENCE>

<BRAKENBURY>	<22%>
	Awak'd you not with this sore agony?
</BRAKENBURY>

<CLARENCE>	<22%>
	No, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
	O! then began the tempest to my soul.
	I pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
	With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
	Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
	The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
	Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
	Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
	Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
	And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
	A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
	Dabbled in blood; and he shriek'd out aloud,
	'Clarence is come,—false, fleeting, perjur'd Clarence,
	That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;—
	Seize on him! Furies, take him unto torment.'
	With that, methought, a legion of foul fiends
	Environ'd me, and howled in mine ears
	Such hideous cries, that, with the very noise
	I trembling wak'd, and, for a season after
	Could not believe but that I was in hell,
	Such terrible impression made my dream.
</CLARENCE>

<BRAKENBURY>	<23%>
	No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;
	I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.
</BRAKENBURY>

<CLARENCE>	<23%>
	O Brakenbury! I have done these things
	That now give evidence against my soul,
	For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me.
	O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
	But thou wilt be aveng'd on my misdeeds,
	Yet execute thy wrath on me alone:
	O! spare my guiltless wife and my poor children.
	I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
	My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
</CLARENCE>

<BRAKENBURY>	<23%>
	I will, my lord. God give your Grace good rest!
<STAGE DIR>
<Clarence sleeps.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
	Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.
	Princes have but their titles for their glories,
	An outward honour for an inward toil;
	And, for unfelt imaginations,
	They often feel a world of restless cares:
	So that, between their titles and low names,
	There's nothing differs but the outward fame.

<MURDERER 1>	<23%>
	Ho! who's here?
</MURDERER 1>

<BRAKENBURY>	<23%>
	What wouldst thou, fellow? and how cam'st thou hither?
</BRAKENBURY>

<MURDERER 1>	<23%>
	I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.
</MURDERER 1>

<BRAKENBURY>	<23%>
	What! so brief?
</BRAKENBURY>

<MURDERER 2>	<23%>
	'Tis better, sir, than to be tedious.—

<A paper is delivered to Brakenbury, who reads it.>
</STAGE DIR>

<BRAKENBURY>	<24%>
	I am, in this, commanded to deliver
	The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
	I will not reason what is meant hereby,
	Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.
	There lies the duke asleep, and there the keys.
	I'll to the king; and signify to him
	That thus I have resign'd to you my charge.

</STAGE DIR>

<MURDERER 2>	<24%>
	What! shall we stab him as he sleeps?
</MURDERER 2>

<MURDERER 1>	<24%>
	No; he'll say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.
</MURDERER 1>

<MURDERER 2>	<24%>
	When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till the judgment-day.
</MURDERER 2>

<MURDERER 1>	<24%>
	Why, then he'll say we stabbed him sleeping.
</MURDERER 1>

<MURDERER 2>	<24%>
	The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind of remorse in me.
</MURDERER 2>

<MURDERER 1>	<24%>
	What! art thou afraid?
</MURDERER 1>

<MURDERER 2>	<24%>
	Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be damn'd for killing him, from the which no warrant can defend me.
</MURDERER 2>

<MURDERER 1>	<24%>
	I thought thou hadst been resolute.
</MURDERER 1>

<MURDERER 2>	<24%>
	So I am, to let him live.
</MURDERER 2>

<MURDERER 1>	<24%>
	I'll back to the Duke of Gloucester, and tell him so.
</MURDERER 1>

<MURDERER 2>	<24%>
	Nay, I prithee, stay a little: I hope my holy humour will change; it was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty.
</MURDERER 2>

<MURDERER 1>	<24%>
	How dost thou feel thyself now?
</MURDERER 1>

<MURDERER 2>	<24%>
	Some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me.
</MURDERER 2>

<MURDERER 1>	<24%>
	Remember our reward when the deed's done.
</MURDERER 1>

<MURDERER 2>	<24%>
	'Zounds! he dies: I had forgot the reward.
</MURDERER 2>

<MURDERER 1>	<24%>
	Where's thy conscience now?
</MURDERER 1>

<MURDERER 2>	<24%>
	In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.
</MURDERER 2>

<MURDERER 1>	<24%>
	So when he opens his purse to give us our reward, thy conscience flies out.
</MURDERER 1>

<MURDERER 2>	<24%>
	'Tis no matter; let it go: there's few or none will entertain it.
</MURDERER 2>

<MURDERER 1>	<24%>
	What if it come to thee again?
</MURDERER 1>

<MURDERER 2>	<25%>
	I'll not meddle with it; it makes a man a coward; a man cannot steal, but it accuseth him; a man cannot swear, but it checks him; a man cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit, that mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of obstacles; it made me once restore a purse of gold that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it; it is turned out of all towns and cities for a dangerous thing; and every man that means to live well, endeavours to trust to himself and live without it.

	'Zounds! it is even now at my elbow, persuading me not to kill the duke.

	The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
	Before I be convict by course of law,
	To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
	I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
	By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,

	To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
</CLARENCE>

<MURDERER 2>	<26%>
	And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
	For false forswearing and for murder too:

	Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
	For Edward, for my brother, for his sake:
	He sends you not to murder me for this;
	For in that sin he is as deep as I.
	If God will be avenged for the deed,
	O! know you yet, he doth it publicly:
	Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
	He needs no indirect or lawless course
	To cut off those that have offended him.

<GLOUCESTER>	<30%>
	Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen;
	And princely peers, a happy time of day!
</GLOUCESTER>

<K. EDWARD>	<30%>
	Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
	Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity;
	Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,
	Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.
</K. EDWARD>

<GLOUCESTER>	<30%>
	A blessed labour, my most sovereign lord.
	Among this princely heap, if any here,
	By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,
	Hold me a foe;
	If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
	Have aught committed that is hardly borne
	By any in this presence, I desire
	To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
	'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
	I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
	First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
	Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
	Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
	If ever any grudge were lodg'd between us;
	Of you, Lord Rivers, and Lord Grey, of you,
	That all without desert have frown'd on me;
	Of you, Lord Woodvile, and Lord Scales, of you;
	Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
	I do not know that Englishman alive
	With whom my soul is any jot at odds
	More than the infant that is born to-night:
	I thank my God for my humility.
</GLOUCESTER>

<Q. ELIZABETH>	<30%>
	A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:
	I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
	My sov'reign lord, I do beseech your highness
	To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
</Q. ELIZABETH>

	Is Clarence dead? the order was revers'd.
</K. EDWARD>

<GLOUCESTER>	<31%>
	But he, poor man, by your first order died,
	And that a winged Mercury did bear;
	Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,
	That came too lag to see him buried.
	God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
	Nearer in bloody thoughts, and not in blood,
	Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
	And yet go current from suspicion.

	Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
</STANLEY>

<K. EDWARD>	<31%>
	Have I a tongue to doom my brother's death,
	And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave?
	My brother kill'd no man, his fault was thought;
	And yet his punishment was bitter death.
	Who su'd to me for him? who, in my wrath,
	Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advis'd?
	Who spoke of brotherhood? who spoke of love?
	Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
	The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?
	Who told me, in the field at Tewksbury,
	When Oxford had me down, he rescu'd me,
	And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king?'
	Who told me, when we both lay in the field
	Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
	Even in his garments; and did give himself,
	All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
	All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
	Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
	Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
	But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
	Have done a drunken slaughter, and defac'd
	The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
	You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
	And I, unjustly too, must grant it you;
	But for my brother not a man would speak,
	Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
	For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
	Have been beholding to him in his life,
	Yet none of you would once beg for his life.
	O God! I fear, thy justice will take hold
	On me and you and mine and yours for this.
	Come, Hastings, help me to my closet. O! poor Clarence!

</BOY>

<DUCHESS>	<33%>
	My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
	I do lament the sickness of the king,

	It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
</DUCHESS>

<BOY>	<33%>
	Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.

	Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
	Told me, the king, provok'd to't by the queen,
	Devis'd impeachments to imprison him:

	Ah! so much interest have I in thy sorrow

	Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
	And I for comfort have but one false glass,
	That grieves me when I see my shame in him.
	Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,
	And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:
	But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,
	And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,
	Clarence and Edward. O! what cause have I—
	Thine being but a moiety of my grief—
	To overgo thy plaints, and drown thy cries!

	The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,

<BUCKINGHAM>	<36%>
	Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,

	Which would be so much the more dangerous,

	And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
	Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.
</YORK>

<DUCHESS>	<38%>
	Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold

	Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord.
</MESSENGER>

<Q. ELIZABETH>	<39%>
	Ah me! I see the ruin of my house!
	The tiger now hath seiz'd the gentle hind;
	Insulting tyranny begins to jet
	Upon the innocent and aweless throne:
	Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!
	I see, as in a map, the end of all.
</Q. ELIZABETH>

<DUCHESS>	<39%>
	Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
	How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
	My husband lost his life to get the crown,
	And often up and down my sons were toss'd,
	For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
	And being seated, and domestic broils
	Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors,
	Make war upon themselves; brother to brother,
	Blood to blood, self against self: O! preposterous
	And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
	Or let me die, to look on death no more.
</DUCHESS>

<Q. ELIZABETH>	<40%>
	Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.
	Madam, farewell.
</Q. ELIZABETH>

	Stay, I will go with you.

<The Trumpets sound. Enter the Prince of Wales, Gloucester,...>
<... Buckingham, Catesby, Cardinal Bourchier, and Others.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<40%>
	Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<GLOUCESTER>	<40%>
	Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign;
	The weary way hath made you melancholy.
</GLOUCESTER>

<PRINCE>	<40%>
	No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
	Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy:
	I want more uncles here to welcome me.
</PRINCE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<40%>
	Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
	Hath not yet div'd into the world's deceit:
	No more can you distinguish of a man
	Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,
	Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
	Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
	Your Grace attended to their sugar'd words,
	But look'd not on the poison of their hearts:
	God keep you from them, and from such false friends!
</GLOUCESTER>

<PRINCE>	<41%>
	God keep me from false friends! but they were none.
</PRINCE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<41%>
	My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet you.

</GLOUCESTER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter the Lord Mayor and his Train.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MAYOR>	<41%>
	God bless your Grace with health and happy days!
</MAYOR>

<PRINCE>	<41%>
	I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.
	I thought my mother and my brother York
	Would long ere this have met us on the way:
	Fie! what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not
	To tell us whether they will come or no.

</PRINCE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Hastings.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<41%>
	And in good time here comes the sweating lord.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<PRINCE>	<41%>
	Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?
</PRINCE>

<HASTINGS>	<41%>
	On what occasion, God he knows, not I,
	The queen your mother, and your brother York,
	Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince
	Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace,
	But by his mother was perforce withheld.
</HASTINGS>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<41%>
	Fie! what an indirect and peevish course
	Is this of hers! Lord Cardinal, will your Grace
	Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
	Unto his princely brother presently?
	If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
	And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<CARDINAL>	<41%>
	My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
	Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
	Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
	To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
	We should infringe the holy privilege
	Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land
	Would I be guilty of so great a sin.
</CARDINAL>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<41%>
	You are too senseless-obstinate, my lord,
	Too ceremonious and traditional:
	Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
	You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
	The benefit thereof is always granted
	To those whose dealings have deserv'd the place
	And those who have the wit to claim the place:
	This prince hath neither claim'd it, nor deserv'd it;
	And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:
	Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
	You break no privilege nor charter there.
	Oft have I heard of sanctuary men,
	But sanctuary children ne'er till now.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<CARDINAL>	<42%>
	My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.
	Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
</CARDINAL>

<HASTINGS>	<42%>
	I go, my lord.
</HASTINGS>

<PRINCE>	<42%>
	Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Cardinal Bourchier and Hastings.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
	Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
</PRINCE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<42%>
	Where it seems best unto your royal self.
	If I may counsel you, some day or two
	Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:
	Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
	For your best health and recreation.
</GLOUCESTER>

<PRINCE>	<42%>
	I do not like the Tower, of any place:
	Did Julius Cæsar build that place, my lord?
</PRINCE>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<42%>
	He did, my gracious lord, begin that place,
	Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<PRINCE>	<42%>
	Is it upon record, or else reported
	Successively from age to age, he built it?
</PRINCE>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<42%>
	Upon record, my gracious lord.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<PRINCE>	<42%>
	But say, my lord, it were not register'd,
	Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
	As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
	Even to the general all-ending day.
</PRINCE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<42%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> So wise so young, they say, do never live long.
</GLOUCESTER>

<PRINCE>	<42%>
	What say you, uncle?
</PRINCE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<42%>
	I say, without characters, fame lives long.
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Thus, like the formal Vice, Iniquity,
	I moralize two meanings in one word.
</GLOUCESTER>

<PRINCE>	<42%>
	That Julius Cæsar was a famous man;
	With what his valour did enrich his wit,
	His wit set down to make his valour live:
	Death makes no conquest of this conqueror,
	For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
	I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,—
</PRINCE>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<43%>
	What, my gracious lord?
</BUCKINGHAM>

<PRINCE>	<43%>
	An if I live until I be a man,
	I'll win our ancient right in France again,
	Or die a soldier, as I liv'd a king.
</PRINCE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<43%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Short summers lightly have a forward spring.

</GLOUCESTER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter York, Hastings, and Cardinal Bourchier.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<43%>
	Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<PRINCE>	<43%>
	Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?
</PRINCE>

<YORK>	<43%>
	Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.
</YORK>

<PRINCE>	<43%>
	Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:
	Too late he died that might have kept that title,
	Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
</PRINCE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<43%>
	How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
</GLOUCESTER>

<YORK>	<43%>
	I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
	You said that idle weeds are fast in growth:
	The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
</YORK>

<GLOUCESTER>	<43%>
	He hath, my lord.
</GLOUCESTER>

<YORK>	<43%>
	And therefore is he idle?
</YORK>

<GLOUCESTER>	<43%>
	O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
</GLOUCESTER>

<YORK>	<43%>
	Then he is more beholding to you than I.
</YORK>

<GLOUCESTER>	<43%>
	He may command me as my sovereign;
	But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
</GLOUCESTER>

<YORK>	<43%>
	I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
</YORK>

<GLOUCESTER>	<43%>
	My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.
</GLOUCESTER>

<PRINCE>	<43%>
	A beggar, brother?
</PRINCE>

<YORK>	<43%>
	Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
	And, being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
</YORK>

<GLOUCESTER>	<43%>
	A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
</GLOUCESTER>

<YORK>	<43%>
	A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.
</YORK>

<GLOUCESTER>	<43%>
	Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.
</GLOUCESTER>

<YORK>	<43%>
	O, then, I see, you'll part but with light gifts;
	In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
</YORK>

<GLOUCESTER>	<43%>
	It is too weighty for your Grace to wear.
</GLOUCESTER>

<YORK>	<43%>
	I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
</YORK>

<GLOUCESTER>	<43%>
	What! would you have my weapon, little lord?
</GLOUCESTER>

<YORK>	<43%>
	I would, that I might thank you, as you call me.
</YORK>

<GLOUCESTER>	<44%>
	How?
</GLOUCESTER>

<YORK>	<44%>
	Little.
</YORK>

<PRINCE>	<44%>
	My Lord of York will still be cross in talk.
	Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.
</PRINCE>

<YORK>	<44%>
	You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:
	Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me.
	Because that I am little, like an ape,
	He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
</YORK>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<44%>
	With what a sharp provided with he reasons!
	To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
	He prettily and aptly taunts himself:
	So cunning and so young is wonderful.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<GLOUCESTER>	<44%>
	My lord, will't please you pass along?
	Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
	Will to your mother, to entreat of her
	To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
</GLOUCESTER>

<YORK>	<44%>
	What! will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
</YORK>

<PRINCE>	<44%>
	My Lord Protector needs will have it so.
</PRINCE>

<YORK>	<44%>
	I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
</YORK>

<GLOUCESTER>	<44%>
	Why, what would you fear?
</GLOUCESTER>

<YORK>	<44%>
	Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:
	My grandam told me he was murder'd there.
</YORK>

<PRINCE>	<44%>
	I fear no uncles dead.
</PRINCE>

<GLOUCESTER>	<44%>
	Nor none that live, I hope.
</GLOUCESTER>

<PRINCE>	<44%>
	An if they live, I hope, I need not fear.
	But come, my lord; and, with a heavy heart,
	Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.
</PRINCE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Sennet. Exeunt all but Gloucester, Buckingham, and Catesby.>
</STAGE DIR>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<44%>
	Think you, my lord, this little prating York
	Was not incensed by his subtle mother
	To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
</BUCKINGHAM>

<GLOUCESTER>	<44%>
	No doubt, no doubt: O! 'tis a parlous boy;
	Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable:
	He's all the mother's, from the top to toe.
</GLOUCESTER>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<44%>
	Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby; thou art sworn
	As deeply to effect what we intend
	As closely to conceal what we impart.
	Thou know'st our reasons urg'd upon the way:
	What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter
	To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
	For the instalment of this noble duke
	In the seat royal of this famous isle?
</BUCKINGHAM>

<CATESBY>	<45%>
	He for his father's sake so loves the prince
	That he will not be won to aught against him.
</CATESBY>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<45%>
	What think'st thou then of Stanley? what will he?
</BUCKINGHAM>

<CATESBY>	<45%>
	He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
</CATESBY>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<45%>
	Well then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
	And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings,
	How he doth stand affected to our purpose;
	And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
	To sit about the coronation.
	If thou dost find him tractable to us,
	Encourage him, and tell him all our reasons:
	If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,
	Be thou so too, and so break off the talk,
	And give us notice of his inclination;
	For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
	Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<GLOUCESTER>	<45%>
	Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
	His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
	To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle;
	And bid my lord, for joy of this good news,
	Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.
</GLOUCESTER>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<45%>
	Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<CATESBY>	<45%>
	My good lords both, with all the heed I can.
</CATESBY>

<GLOUCESTER>	<45%>
	Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
</GLOUCESTER>

<CATESBY>	<45%>
	You shall, my lord.
</CATESBY>

<GLOUCESTER>	<45%>
	At Crosby-place, there shall you find us both.
</GLOUCESTER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Catesby.>
</STAGE DIR>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<45%>
	Now, my lord, what shall we do if we perceive
	Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
</BUCKINGHAM>

<GLOUCESTER>	<45%>
	Chop off his head; something we will determine:
	And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me
	The earldom of Hereford, and all the moveables
	Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.
</GLOUCESTER>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<45%>
	I'll claim that promise at your Grace's hand.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<GLOUCESTER>	<45%>
	And look to have it yielded with all kindness.
	Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
	We may digest our complots in some form.

</STAGE DIR> Who knocks?
</HASTINGS>

<STAGE DIR>
<Within.>
</STAGE DIR> What is't o'clock?
</HASTINGS>

<MESSENGER>	<46%>
	Upon the stroke of four.

</MESSENGER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Hastings.>
</STAGE DIR>
<HASTINGS>	<46%>
	Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights?
</HASTINGS>

<MESSENGER>	<46%>
	So it appears by that I have to say.
	First, he commends him to your noble self.
</MESSENGER>

<HASTINGS>	<46%>
	What then?
</HASTINGS>

<MESSENGER>	<46%>
	Then certifies your lordship, that this night
	He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm:
	Besides, he says there are two councils held;
	And that may be determin'd at the one
	Which may make you and him to rue at the other.
	Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,
	If you will presently take horse with him,
	And with all speed post with him towards the north,
	To shun the danger that his soul divines.
</MESSENGER>

<HASTINGS>	<46%>
	Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
	Bid him not fear the separated councils:
	His honour and myself are at the one,
	And at the other is my good friend Catesby;
	Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
	Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
	Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:
	And for his dreams, I wonder he's so fond
	To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers.
	To fly the boar before the boar pursues,
	Were to incense the boar to follow us
	And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
	Go, bid thy master rise and come to me;
	And we will both together to the Tower,
	Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.
</HASTINGS>

<MESSENGER>	<46%>
	I'll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.

<CATESBY>	<47%>

</CATESBY>

<HASTINGS>	<47%>
	Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring.
	What news, what news, in this our tottering state?
</HASTINGS>

<CATESBY>	<47%>
	It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;
	And I believe will never stand upright
	Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.
</CATESBY>

<HASTINGS>	<47%>
	How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?
</HASTINGS>

<CATESBY>	<47%>
	Ay, my good lord.
</CATESBY>

<HASTINGS>	<47%>
	I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
	Before I'll see the crown so foul misplac'd.
	But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
</HASTINGS>

<CATESBY>	<47%>
	Ay, on my life; and hopes to find you forward
	Upon his party for the gain thereof:
	And thereupon he sends you this good news,
	That this same very day your enemies,
	The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.
</CATESBY>

<HASTINGS>	<47%>
	Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
	Because they have been still my adversaries;
	But that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,
	To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
	God knows I will not do it, to the death.
</HASTINGS>

<CATESBY>	<47%>
	God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
</CATESBY>

<HASTINGS>	<47%>
	But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
	That they which brought me in my master's hate,
	I live to look upon their tragedy.
	Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older,
	I'll send some packing that yet think not on't.
</HASTINGS>

<CATESBY>	<47%>
	'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
	When men are unprepar'd and look not for it.
</CATESBY>

<HASTINGS>	<47%>
	O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
	With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so 'twill do
	With some men else, who think themselves as safe
	As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear
	To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
</HASTINGS>

<CATESBY>	<47%>

<STAGE DIR>

	Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
</HASTINGS>
	Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?
<STANLEY>	<48%>
	My lord, good morrow; good morrow Catesby:
	You may jest on, but by the holy rood,
	I do not like these several councils, I.
</STANLEY>

<HASTINGS>	<48%>
	My lord, I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
	And never, in my days, I do protest,
	Was it so precious to me as 'tis now.
	Think you, but that I know our state secure,
	I would be so triumphant as I am?
</HASTINGS>

<STANLEY>	<48%>
	The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
	Were jocund and suppos'd their state was sure,
	And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
	But yet you see how soon the day o'ercast.
	This sudden stab of rancour I misdoubt;
	Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
	What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.
</STANLEY>

<HASTINGS>	<48%>
	Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
	To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.
</HASTINGS>

<STANLEY>	<48%>
	They, for their truth, might better wear their heads,

	I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
	Than when I met thee last where now we meet:
	Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,
	By the suggestion of the queen's allies;
	But now, I tell thee,—keep it to thyself,—
	This day those enemies are put to death,

	So dear I lov'd the man, that I must weep.
	I took him for the plainest harmless creature
	That breath'd upon the earth a Christian;
	Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded
	The history of all her secret thoughts:
	So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
	That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
	I mean his conversation with Shore's wife,
	He liv'd from all attainder of suspect.
</GLOUCESTER>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<54%>
	Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor

	This day had plotted, in the council-house,
	To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?

<GLOUCESTER>	<54%>
	What! think you we are Turks or infidels?

	Proceed thus rashly in the villain's death,
	But that the extreme peril of the case,
	The peace of England and our person's safety,
	Enforc'd us to this execution?
</GLOUCESTER>

<MAYOR>	<54%>
	Now, fair befall you! he deserv'd his death;
	And your good Graces both have well proceeded,
	To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
	I never look'd for better at his hands,
	After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
</MAYOR>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<54%>
	Yet had we not determin'd he should die,
	Until your lordship came to see his end;
	Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
	Something against our meaning, hath prevented:
	Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
	The traitor speak, and timorously confess
	The manner and the purpose of his treason;
	That you might well have signified the same
	Unto the citizens, who haply may
	Misconster us in him, and wail his death.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<MAYOR>	<55%>
	But, my good lord, your Grace's word shall serve,
	As well as I had seen and heard him speak:

	With all your just proceedings in this cause.

	Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
	The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
	There, at your meetest vantage of the time,
	Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
	Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,
	Only for saying he would make his son
	Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,
	Which by the sign thereof was termed so.
	Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
	And bestial appetite in change of lust;
	Which stretch'd unto their servants, daughters, wives,
	Even where his raging eye or savage heart
	Without control lusted to make a prey.
	Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
	Tell them, when that my mother went with child
	Of that insatiate Edward, noble York
	My princely father then had wars in France;
	And, by true computation of the time,
	Found that the issue was not his begot;
	Which well appeared in his lineaments,
	Being nothing like the noble duke my father.
	Yet touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off;
	Because, my lord, you know my mother lives.
</GLOUCESTER>

	Eleven hours I have spent to write it over,
	For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me.
	The precedent was full as long a-doing;
	And yet within these five hours Hastings liv'd,
	Untainted, unexamin'd, free, at liberty.
	Here's a good world the while! Who is so gross

	Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?

	I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
	And his contract by deputy in France;
	The insatiate greediness of his desires,
	And his enforcement of the city wives;
	His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
	As being got, your father then in France,
	And his resemblance, being not like the duke:
	Withal I did infer your lineaments,
	Being the right idea of your father,
	Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
	Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
	Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace,
	Your bounty, virtue, fair humility;
	Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose
	Untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse;

	I bade them that did love their country's good
	Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'
</BUCKINGHAM>

<GLOUCESTER>	<57%>
	And did they so?
</GLOUCESTER>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<57%>
	No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
	But, like dumb statuas or breathing stones,
	Star'd each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
	Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
	And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
	His answer was, the people were not wont
	To be spoke to but by the recorder.
	Then he was urg'd to tell my tale again:
	'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'
	But nothing spoke in warrant from himself.
	When he had done, some followers of mine own,
	At lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,
	And some ten voices cried, 'God save King Richard!'
	And thus I took the vantage of those few,
	'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;
	'This general applause and cheerful shout
	Argues your wisdom and your love to Richard:'
	And even here brake off, and came away.

</BUCKINGHAM>

<GLOUCESTER>	<59%>
	My lord, there needs no such apology;
	I do beseech your Grace to pardon me,
	Who, earnest in the service of my God,
	Deferr'd the visitation of my friends.
	But, leaving this, what is your Grace's pleasure?
</GLOUCESTER>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<59%>
	Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
	And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<GLOUCESTER>	<59%>
	I do suspect I have done some offence
	That seems disgracious in the city's eye;
	And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
</GLOUCESTER>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<59%>
	You have, my lord: would it might please your Grace,
	On our entreaties to amend your fault!
</BUCKINGHAM>

<GLOUCESTER>	<59%>
	Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
</GLOUCESTER>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<59%>
	Know then, it is your fault that you resign
	The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
	The sceptred office of your ancestors,
	Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
	The lineal glory of your royal house,
	To the corruption of a blemish'd stock;
	Whiles, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,—
	Which here we waken to our country's good,—
	This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
	Her face defac'd with scars of infamy,
	Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
	And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
	Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion.
	Which to recure we heartily solicit
	Your gracious self to take on you the charge
	And kingly government of this your land;
	Not as protector, steward, substitute,
	Or lowly factor for another's gain;
	But as successively from blood to blood,
	Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
	For this, consorted with the citizens,
	Your very worshipful and loving friends,
	And by their vehement instigation,
	In this just cause come I to move your Grace.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<GLOUCESTER>	<60%>
	I cannot tell, if to depart in silence
	Or bitterly to speak in your reproof,
	Best fitteth my degree or your condition:
	If not to answer, you might haply think
	Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
	To bear the golden yoke of sov'reignty,
	Which fondly you would here impose on me;
	If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
	So season'd with your faithful love to me,
	Then, on the other side, I check'd my friends.
	Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
	And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
	Definitively thus I answer you.
	Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
	Unmeritable shuns your high request.
	First, if all obstacles were cut away,
	And that my path were even to the crown,
	As the ripe revenue and due of birth,
	Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
	So mighty and so many my defects,
	That I would rather hide me from my greatness,
	Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
	Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
	And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
	But, God be thank'd, there is no need of me;
	And much I need to help you, were there need;
	The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
	Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
	Will well become the seat of majesty,
	And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
	On him I lay that you would lay on me,
	The right and fortune of his happy stars;
	Which God defend that I should wring from him!
</GLOUCESTER>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<61%>
	My lord, this argues conscience in your Grace;
	But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
	All circumstances well considered.
	You say that Edward is your brother's son:
	So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
	For first was he contract to Lady Lucy,
	Your mother lives a witness to his vow,
	And afterward by substitute betroth'd
	To Bona, sister to the King of France.
	These both put by, a poor petitioner,
	A care-craz'd mother to a many sons,
	A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
	Even in the afternoon of her best days,
	Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,
	Seduc'd the pitch and height of his degree
	To base declension and loath'd bigamy:
	By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
	This Edward, whom our manners call the prince.
	More bitterly could I expostulate,
	Save that, for reverence to some alive,
	I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
	Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
	This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
	If not to bless us and the land withal,
	Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
	From the corruption of abusing times,
	Unto a lineal true-derived course.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<MAYOR>	<61%>
	Do, good my lord; your citizens entreat you.
</MAYOR>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<61%>
	Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<CATESBY>	<61%>
	O! make them joyful: grant their lawful suit:
</CATESBY>

<GLOUCESTER>	<61%>
	Alas! why would you heap those cares on me?
	I am unfit for state and majesty:
	I do beseech you, take it not amiss,
	I cannot nor I will not yield to you.
</GLOUCESTER>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<62%>
	If you refuse it, as, in love and zeal,
	Loath to depose the child, your brother's son;
	As well we know your tenderness of heart
	And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
	Which we have noted in you to your kindred,
	And egally, indeed, to all estates,
	Yet whether you accept our suit or no,
	Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
	But we will plant some other in the throne,
	To the disgrace and downfall of your house:
	And in this resolution here we leave you.
	Come, citizens, we will entreat no more.

	Cousin of Buckingham, and sage, grave men,
	Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
	To bear her burden, whe'r I will or no,
	I must have patience to endure the load:
	But if black scandal or foul-fac'd reproach
	Attend the sequel of your imposition,
	Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
	From all the impure blots and stains thereof;

</STAGE DIR>
<DUCHESS>	<63%>
	Who meets us here? my niece Plantagenet,

<ANNE>	<63%>
	No further than the Tower; and, as I guess,

	Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together:—

	Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
</Q. ELIZABETH>
	How doth the prince, and my young son of York?
<BRAKENBURY>	<63%>
	Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
	I may not suffer you to visit them:
	The king hath strictly charg'd the contrary.
</BRAKENBURY>

<Q. ELIZABETH>	<63%>
	The king! who's that?
</Q. ELIZABETH>

<BRAKENBURY>	<63%>
	I mean the Lord Protector.
</BRAKENBURY>

<Q. ELIZABETH>	<63%>
	The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
	Hath he set bounds between their love and me?

	I am their father's mother; I will see them.
</DUCHESS>

<ANNE>	<63%>
	Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:
	Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame,
	And take thy office from thee, on my peril.

	No, madam, no, I may not leave it so:

</STAGE DIR> Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,

<Q. ELIZABETH>	<64%>
	Ah! cut my lace asunder,

</ANNE>

<DORSET>	<64%>
	Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your Grace?
</DORSET>

<Q. ELIZABETH>	<64%>
	O, Dorset! speak not to me, get thee gone;
	Death and destruction dog thee at the heels:
	Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
	If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
	And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell:
	Go, hie thee, hie thee, from this slaughter-house,
	Lest thou increase the number of the dead,
	And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
	Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.
</Q. ELIZABETH>

<STANLEY>	<64%>
	Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
<STAGE DIR>
<To Dorset.>
</STAGE DIR> Take all the swift advantage of the hours;

	Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.

<DUCHESS>	<64%>
	O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
	O! my accursed womb, the bed of death,
	A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,

<STANLEY>	<64%>
	Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.
</STANLEY>

<ANNE>	<64%>
	And I with all unwillingness will go.
	O! would to God that the inclusive verge
	Of golden metal that must round my brow
	Were red-hot steel to sear me to the brain.
	Anointed let me be with deadly venom;
	And die, ere men can say 'God save the queen!'
</ANNE>

<Q. ELIZABETH>	<65%>
	Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory;
	To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.
</Q. ELIZABETH>

<ANNE>	<65%>
	No! why? When he, that is my husband now
	Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse;
	When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands,
	Which issu'd from my other angel husband,
	And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;
	O! when I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
	This was my wish, 'Be thou,' quoth I, 'accurs'd,
	For making me so young, so old a widow!
	And, when thou wedd'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
	And be thy wife—if any be so mad—
	More miserable by the life of thee
	Than thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!'
	Lo! ere I can repeat this curse again,
	Within so small a time, my woman's heart
	Grossly grew captive to his honey words,
	And prov'd the subject of mine own soul's curse:
	Which hitherto hath held mine eyes from rest;
	For never yet one hour in his bed
	Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep,
	But with his timorous dreams was still awak'd.
	Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick,
	And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.
</ANNE>

<Q. ELIZABETH>	<65%>
	Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.
</Q. ELIZABETH>

</DUCHESS>

<Q. ELIZABETH>	<65%>
	Stay yet, look back with me unto the Tower.
	Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
	Whom envy hath immur'd within your walls,

	Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
	For tender princes, use my babies well.
	So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.

<BUCKINGHAM>	<69%>
	My lord, your promise for the earldom,—
</BUCKINGHAM>

<K. RICHARD>	<69%>
	Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
	The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,
	And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,
	Because a bard of Ireland told me once
	I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
</K. RICHARD>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<69%>
	My lord!

<K. RICHARD>	<69%>

</K. RICHARD>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<69%>
	Upon the stroke of ten.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<K. RICHARD>	<69%>
	Well, let it strike.
</K. RICHARD>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<69%>
	Why let it strike?
</BUCKINGHAM>

<K. RICHARD>	<69%>
	Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke
	Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
	I am not in the giving vein to-day.
</K. RICHARD>

<BUCKINGHAM>	<69%>

<TYRRELL>	<69%>
	The tyrannous and bloody act is done;
	The most arch deed of piteous massacre
	That ever yet this land was guilty of.
	Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn
	To do this piece of ruthless butchery,
	Albeit they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
	Melting with tenderness and mild compassion,
	Wept like to children in their death's sad story.
	'Oh! thus,' quoth Dighton, 'lay the gentle babes:'
	'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another
	Within their alabaster innocent arms:
	Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
	Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
	A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
	Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost chang'd my mind;
	But, O, the devil'—there the villain stopp'd;
	When Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
	The most replenished sweet work of nature,
	That from the prime creation e'er she fram'd.'
	Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse;
	They could not speak; and so I left them both,
	To bear this tidings to the bloody king:
	And here he comes.

	Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard kill'd him.

<MARGARET>	<72%>
	Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.
	From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
	A hellhound that doth hunt us all to death:
	That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
	To worry lambs, and lap their gentle blood,
	That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
	That excellent grand-tyrant of the earth,
	That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
	Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.
	O! upright, just, and true-disposing God,
	How do I thank thee that this carnal cur
	Preys on the issue of his mother's body,
	And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan.
</MARGARET>

	O! Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes:

	Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
	And now I cloy me with beholding it.
	Thy Edward he is dead, that kill'd my Edward;
	Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
	Young York he is but boot, because both they
	Match not the high perfection of my loss:
	Thy Clarence he is dead that stabb'd my Edward;
	And the beholders of this tragic play,
	The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
	Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
	Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
	Only reserv'd their factor, to buy souls
	And send them thither; but at hand, at hand,
	Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:
	Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray,
	To have him suddenly convey'd from hence.
	Cancel his bond of life, dear God! I pray,
	That I may live to say, The dog is dead.

<Q. ELIZABETH>	<73%>

</Q. ELIZABETH>

<MARGARET>	<73%>
	I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;
	I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;
	The presentation of but what I was;
	The flattering index of a direful pageant;
	One heav'd a-high to be hurl'd down below;
	A mother only mock'd with two fair babes;
	A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
	A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
	To be the aim of every dangerous shot;
	A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
	Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
	Where are thy children? wherein dost thou joy?
	Who sues and kneels and cries God save the queen?
	Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
	Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?
	Decline all this, and see what now thou art:
	For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
	For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
	For one being su'd to, one that humbly sues;
	For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;
	For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
	For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;
	For one commanding all, obey'd of none.
	Thus hath the course of justice whirl'd about,
	And left thee but a very prey to time;
	Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
	To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
	Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
	Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
	Now thy proud neck bears half my burden'd yoke;
	From which even here, I slip my wearied head,
	And leave the burden of it all on thee.
	Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:
	These English woes shall make me smile in France.

	To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
	But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
	My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys

	Look, what is done cannot be now amended:
	Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,

	If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
	To make amends I'll give it to your daughter.
	If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
	To quicken your increase, I will beget
	Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter:
	A grandam's name is little less in love
	Than is the doting title of a mother;
	They are as children but one step below,
	Even of your mettle, of your very blood;
	Of all one pain, save for a night of groans
	Endur'd of her for whom you bid like sorrow.
	Your children were vexation to your youth,
	But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
	The loss you have is but a son being king,
	And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
	I cannot make you what amends I would,
	Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
	Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
	Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
	This fair alliance quickly shall call home
	To high promotions and great dignity:
	The king that calls your beauteous daughter wife,
	Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
	Again shall you be mother to a king,
	And all the ruins of distressful times
	Repair'd with double riches of content.
	What! we have many goodly days to see:
	The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
	Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
	Advantaging their loan with interest
	Of ten times double gain of happiness.
	Go then, my mother; to thy daughter go:
	Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
	Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale;
	Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
	Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess
	With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys:
	And when this arm of mine hath chastised
	The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
	Bound with triumphant garlands will I come,
	And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
	To whom I will retail my conquest won,
	And she shall be sole victress, Cæsar's Cæsar.

	Why, then, by God,—

<Q. ELIZABETH>	<81%>
	God's wrong is most of all.
	If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by him,
	The unity the king my husband made
	Had not been broken, nor my brothers died:
	If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by him,
	The imperial metal, circling now thy head,
	Had grac'd the tender temples of my child,
	And both the princes had been breathing here,
	Which now, too tender bed-fellows for dust,
	Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
	What canst thou swear by now?
</Q. ELIZABETH>

<K. RICHARD>	<81%>
	The time to come.
</K. RICHARD>

<Q. ELIZABETH>	<81%>
	That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;
	For I myself have many tears to wash
	Hereafter time for time past wrong'd by thee.
	The children live, whose parents thou hast slaughter'd,
	Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age:
	The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,
	Old barren plants, to wail it with their age.
	Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
	Misus'd ere us'd, by times ill-us'd o'erpast.

	Death, desolation, ruin, and decay:
	It cannot be avoided but by this;
	It will not be avoided but by this.
	Therefore, dear mother,—I must call you so,—
	Be the attorney of my love to her:
	Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
	Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
	Urge the necessity and state of times,

	His oration to his Soldiers.
	More than I have said, loving countrymen,
	The leisure and enforcement of the time
	Forbids to dwell on: yet remember this,
	God and our good cause fight upon our side;
	The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
	Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
	Richard except, those whom we fight against
	Had rather have us win than him they follow.
	For what is he they follow? truly, gentlemen,
	A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
	One rais'd in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
	One that made means to come by what he hath,
	And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;
	A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
	Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
	One that hath ever been God's enemy.
	Then, if you fight against God's enemy,
	God will in justice, ward you as his soldiers;
	If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
	You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
	If you do fight against your country's foes,
	Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;
	If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
	Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
	If you do free your children from the sword,
	Your children's children quit it in your age.
	Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
	Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
	For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
	Shall be this cold corse on the earth's cold face;
	But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
	The least of your shall share his part thereof.
	Sound drums and trumpets, boldly and cheerfully;
	God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!

	Long kept in Britaine at our mother's cost?

	Lash hence these overweening rags of France,
	These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
	Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,

	Divided in their dire division,
	O! now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,
	The true succeeders of each royal house,
	By God's fair ordinance conjoin together;
	And let their heirs—God, if thy will be so,—
	Enrich the time to come with smooth-fac'd peace,
	With smiling plenty, and fair prosperous days!
	Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
	That would reduce these bloody days again,
	And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
	Let them not live to taste this land's increase,
	That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
	Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
	That she may long live here, God say amen!
