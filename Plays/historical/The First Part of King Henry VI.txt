<ACT 1>


<SCENE 1>
<Westminster Abbey.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Dead March. Enter the Funeral of King Henry the Fifth...>
<... attended on by the Dukes of Bedford, Gloucester,...>
<... and Exeter; the Earl of Warwick, the Bishop of Winchester, Heralds, &c.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BEDFORD>	<1%>
	Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!
	Comets, importing change of times and states,
	Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,
	And with them scourge the bad revolting stars,
	That have consented unto Henry's death!
	King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!
	England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
</BEDFORD>

<GLOUCESTER>	<1%>
	England ne'er had a king until his time.
	Virtue he had, deserving to command:
	His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams;
	His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;
	His sparkling eyes, replete with wrathful fire,
	More dazzled and drove back his enemies
	Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.
	What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:
	He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.
</GLOUCESTER>

<EXETER>	<1%>
	We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?
	Henry is dead and never shall revive.
	Upon a wooden coffin we attend,
	And death's dishonourable victory
	We with our stately presence glorify,
	Like captives bound to a triumphant car.
	What! shall we curse the planets of mishap
	That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?
	Or shall we think the subtle-witted French
	Conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him,
	By magic verses have contriv'd his end?
</EXETER>

<WINCHESTER>	<1%>
	He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.
	Unto the French the dreadful judgment-day
	So dreadful will not be as was his sight.
	The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:
	The church's prayers made him so prosperous.
</WINCHESTER>

<GLOUCESTER>	<2%>
	The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd
	His thread of life had not so soon decay'd:
	None do you like but an effeminate prince,
	Whom like a school-boy you may over-awe.
</GLOUCESTER>

<WINCHESTER>	<2%>
	Gloucester, whate'er we like thou art protector,
	And lookest to command the prince and realm.
	Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,
	More than God or religious churchmen may.
</WINCHESTER>

<GLOUCESTER>	<2%>
	Name not religion, for thou lov'st the flesh,
	And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st,
	Except it be to pray against thy foes.
</GLOUCESTER>

<BEDFORD>	<2%>
	Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace!
	Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:
	Instead of gold we'll offer up our arms,
	Since arms avail not, now that Henry's dead.
	Posterity, await for wretched years,
	When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck,
	Our isle be made a marish of salt tears,
	And none but women left to wail the dead.
	Henry the Fifth! thy ghost I invocate:
	Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils!
	Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!
	A far more glorious star thy soul will make,
	Than Julius Cæsar, or bright—

<Enter a Messenger.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MESSENGER>	<2%>
	My honourable lords, health to you all!
	Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,
	Of loss, of slaughter, and discomfiture:
	Guienne, Champaigne, Rheims, Orleans,
	Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.
</MESSENGER>

<BEDFORD>	<3%>
	What sayst thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?
	Speak softly; or the loss of those great towns
	Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.
</BEDFORD>

<GLOUCESTER>	<3%>
	Is Paris lost? is Roan yielded up?
	If Henry were recall'd to life again
	These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.
</GLOUCESTER>

<EXETER>	<3%>
	How were they lost? what treachery was us'd?
</EXETER>

<MESSENGER>	<3%>
	No treachery; but want of men and money.
	Among the soldiers this is muttered,
	That here you maintain several factions;
	And, whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,
	You are disputing of your generals.
	One would have lingering wars with little cost;
	Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;
	A third thinks, without expense at all,
	By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.
	Awake, awake, English nobility!
	Let not sloth dim your honours new-begot:
	Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;
	Of England's coat one half is cut away.
</MESSENGER>

<EXETER>	<3%>
	Were our tears wanting to this funeral
	These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.
</EXETER>

<BEDFORD>	<3%>
	Me they concern; Regent I am of France.
	Give me my steeled coat: I'll fight for France.
	Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!
	Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,
	To weep their intermissive miseries.

<Enter another Messenger.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MESSENGER 2>	<4%>
	Lords, view these letters, full of bad mischance.
	France is revolted from the English quite,
	Except some petty towns of no import:
	The Dauphin Charles is crowned king in Rheims;
	The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd;
	Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;
	The Duke of Alençon flieth to his side.
</MESSENGER 2>

<EXETER>	<4%>
	The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!
	O! whither shall we fly from this reproach?
</EXETER>

<GLOUCESTER>	<4%>
	We will not fly, but to our enemies' throats.
	Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out.
</GLOUCESTER>

<BEDFORD>	<4%>
	Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?
	An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,
	Wherewith already France is overrun.

</BEDFORD>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter a third Messenger.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MESSENGER 3>	<4%>
	My gracious lords, to add to your laments,
	Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,
	I must inform you of a dismal fight
	Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.
</MESSENGER 3>

<WINCHESTER>	<4%>
	What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?
</WINCHESTER>

<MESSENGER 3>	<4%>
	O, no! wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:
	The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.
	The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,
	Retiring from the siege of Orleans,
	Having full scarce six thousand in his troop,
	By three-and-twenty thousand of the French
	Was round encompassed and set upon.
	No leisure had he to enrank his men;
	He wanted pikes to set before his archers;
	Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges
	They pitched in the ground confusedly,
	To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.
	More than three hours the fight continued;
	Where valiant Talbot above human thought
	Enacted wonders with his sword and lance.
	Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;
	Here, there, and every where, enrag'd he flew:
	The French exclaim'd the devil was in arms;
	All the whole army stood agaz'd on him.
	His soldiers, spying his undaunted spirit,
	A Talbot! A Talbot! cried out amain,
	And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.
	Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,
	If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward.
	He, being in the vaward,—plac'd behind,
	With purpose to relieve and follow them,—
	Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.
	Hence grew the general wrack and massacre;
	Enclosed were they with their enemies.
	A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,
	Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back;
	Whom all France, with their chief assembled strength,
	Durst not presume to look once in the face.
</MESSENGER 3>

<BEDFORD>	<5%>
	Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,
	For living idly here in pomp and ease
	Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,
	Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.
</BEDFORD>

<MESSENGER 3>	<5%>
	O no! he lives; but is took prisoner,
	And Lord Scales with him, and Lord Hungerford:
	Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.
</MESSENGER 3>

<BEDFORD>	<5%>
	His ransom there is none but I shall pay:
	I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne;
	His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;
	Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.
	Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;
	Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,
	To keep our great Saint George's feast withal:
	Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,
	Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.
</BEDFORD>

<MESSENGER 3>	<6%>
	So you had need; for Orleans is besieg'd;
	The English army is grown weak and faint;
	The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,
	And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,
	Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.
</MESSENGER 3>

<EXETER>	<6%>
	Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
	Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,
	Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.
</EXETER>

<BEDFORD>	<6%>
	I do remember it; and here take my leave,
	To go about my preparation.
</BEDFORD>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<GLOUCESTER>	<6%>
	I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can,
	To view the artillery and munition;
	And then I will proclaim young Henry king.
</GLOUCESTER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<EXETER>	<6%>
	To Eltham will I, where the young king is,
	Being ordain'd his special governor;
	And for his safety there I'll best devise.
</EXETER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<WINCHESTER>	<6%>
	Each hath his place and function to attend:
	I am left out; for me nothing remains.
	But long I will not be Jack-out-of-office.
	The king from Eltham I intend to steal,
	And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.

</STAGE DIR>
<CHARLES>	<7%>
	Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens
	So in the earth, to this day is not known.
	Late did he shine upon the English side;
	Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.
	What towns of any moment but we have?
	At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;
	Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts,
	Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.
</CHARLES>

<ALENÇON>	<7%>
	They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves:
	Either they must be dieted like mules
	And have their provender tied to their mouths,
	Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
</ALENÇON>

<REIGNIER>	<7%>
	Let's raise the siege: why live we idly here?
	Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear:
	Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury,
	And he may well in fretting spend his gall;
	Nor men nor money hath he to make war.
</REIGNIER>

<CHARLES>	<7%>
	Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.
	Now for the honour of the forlorn French!
	Him I forgive my death that killeth me
	When he sees me go back one foot or fly.

<CHARLES>	<7%>
	Who ever saw the like? what men have I!
	Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled
	But that they left me 'midst my enemies.
</CHARLES>

<REIGNIER>	<8%>
	Salisbury is a desperate homicide;
	He fighteth as one weary of his life:
	The other lords, like lions wanting food,
	Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.
</REIGNIER>

<ALENÇON>	<8%>
	Froissart, a countryman of ours, records,
	England all Olivers and Rowlands bred
	During the time Edward the Third did reign.
	More truly now may this be verified;
	For none but Samsons and Goliases,
	It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!
	Lean raw-bon'd rascals! who would e'er suppose
	They had such courage and audacity?
</ALENÇON>

<CHARLES>	<8%>
	Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd slaves,
	And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:
	Of old I know them; rather with their teeth
	The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.
</CHARLES>

<REIGNIER>	<8%>
	I think, by some odd gimmals or device,
	Their arms are set like clocks, still to strike on;
	Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
	By my consent, we'll e'en let them alone.
</REIGNIER>

	Be it so.

	Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us.
</CHARLES>

<BASTARD>	<8%>
	Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd:
	Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?
	Be not dismay'd, for succour is at hand:
	A holy maid hither with me I bring,
	Which by a vision sent to her from heaven
	Ordained is to raise this tedious siege,
	And drive the English forth the bounds of France.
	The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,
	Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome;
	What's past and what's to come she can descry.
	Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,
	For they are certain and unfallible.
</BASTARD>

<CHARLES>	<9%>
	Go, call her in. <STAGE DIR>
<Exit Bastard.>
</STAGE DIR> But first, to try her skill,
	Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:
	Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern:
	By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.

<JOAN>	<9%>
	Reignier, is't thou that thinkest to beguile me?
	Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind;
	I know thee well, though never seen before.
	Be not amaz'd, there's nothing hid from me:
	In private will I talk with thee apart.
	Stand back, you lords, and give us leave a while.
</JOAN>

<REIGNIER>	<9%>
	She takes upon her bravely at first dash.
</REIGNIER>

<JOAN>	<9%>
	Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,
	My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.
	Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleas'd
	To shine on my contemptible estate:
	Lo! whilst I waited on my tender lambs,
	And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,
	God's mother deigned to appear to me,
	And in a vision full of majesty
	Will'd me to leave my base vocation
	And free my country from calamity:
	Her aid she promis'd and assur'd success;
	In complete glory she reveal'd herself;
	And, whereas I was black and swart before,
	With those clear rays which she infus'd on me,
	That beauty am I bless'd with which you see.
	Ask me what question thou canst possible
	And I will answer unpremeditated:
	My courage try by combat, if thou dar'st,
	And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.
	Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate
	If thou receive me for thy war-like mate.
</JOAN>

<CHARLES>	<10%>
	Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms.
	Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,
	In single combat thou shalt buckle with me,
	And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;
	Otherwise I renounce all confidence.
</CHARLES>

<JOAN>	<10%>
	I am prepar'd: here is my keen-edg'd sword,
	Deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side;
	The which at Touraine, in Saint Katharine's churchyard,
	Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.
</JOAN>

<CHARLES>	<10%>
	Then come, o' God's name; I fear no woman.

	Christ's mother helps me, else I were too weak.
</JOAN>

<CHARLES>	<11%>
	Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me:
	Impatiently I burn with thy desire;
	My heart and hands thou hast at once subdu'd.
	Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,
	Let me thy servant and not sovereign be;
	'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.
</CHARLES>

<JOAN>	<11%>
	I must not yield to any rites of love,
	For my profession's sacred from above:
	When I have chased all thy foes from hence,
	Then will I think upon a recompense.

	My lord, where are you? what devise you on?
	Shall we give over Orleans, or no?
</REIGNIER>

<JOAN>	<11%>
	Why, no, I say, distrustful recreants!
	Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard.
</JOAN>

<CHARLES>	<11%>
	What she says, I'll confirm: we'll fight it out.
</CHARLES>

<JOAN>	<11%>
	Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.
	This night the siege assuredly I'll raise:
	Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyon days,
	Since I have entered into these wars.
	Glory is like a circle in the water,
	Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself,
	Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.
	With Henry's death the English circle ends;
	Dispersed are the glories it included.
	Now am I like that proud insulting ship
	Which Cæsar and his fortune bare at once.

<CHARLES>	<12%>
	Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?
	Thou with an eagle art inspired then.

	Wont through a secret gate of iron bars
	In yonder tower to overpeer the city,

</SALISBURY>

<TALBOT>	<17%>
	The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner
	Called the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;
	For him I was exchang'd and ransomed.
	But with a baser man at arms by far
	Once in contempt they would have barter'd me:
	Which I disdaining scorn'd, and craved death
	Rather than I would be so vile-esteem'd.
	In fine, redeem'd I was as I desir'd.
	But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart:
	Whom with my bare fists I would execute
	If I now had him brought into my power.
</TALBOT>

<SALISBURY>	<17%>
	Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.
</SALISBURY>

<TALBOT>	<17%>

	In open market-place produc'd they me,
	To be a public spectacle to all:
	Here, said they, is the terror of the French,
	The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
	Then broke I from the officers that led me,
	And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
	To hurl at the beholders of my shame.
	My grisly countenance made others fly.
	None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
	In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
	So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread
	That they suppos'd I could rend bars of steel
	And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:
	Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,
	That walk'd about me every minute-while;
	And if I did but stir out of my bed
	Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.

	What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?
	Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak:
	How far'st thou, mirror of all martial men?
	One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
	Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
	That hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy!
	In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;
	Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;
	Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up,
	His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.
	Yet liv'st thou, Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,
	One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace:
	The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
	Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,
	If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
	Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.
	Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?
	Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.
	Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort;
	Thou shalt not die, whiles—
	He beckons with his hand and smiles on me,
	As who should say, 'When I am dead and gone,
	Remember to avenge me on the French.'
	Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,
	Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:
	Wretched shall France be only in my name.

	Is this the scourge of France?

	I see report is fabulous and false:

	A second Hector, for his grim aspect,
	And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.

	And least proportion of humanity.
	I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,
	It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
	Your roof were not sufficient to contain it.

<COUNTESS>	<31%>
	Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse:

<TALBOT>	<31%>
	Be not dismay'd, fair lady; nor misconster
	The mind of Talbot as you did mistake
	The outward composition of his body.
	What you have done hath not offended me;

	But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,
	Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.
</WARWICK>

<PLANTAGENET>	<32%>
	Tut, tut! here is a mannerly forbearance:
	The truth appears so naked on my side,
	That any purblind eye may find it out.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SOMERSET>	<32%>
	And on my side it is so well apparell'd,

	Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,

	Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?
	His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood;
	And, till thou be restor'd, thou art a yeoman.
</SOMERSET>

<PLANTAGENET>	<35%>
	My father was attached, not attained;
	Condemn'd to die for treason, but no traitor;
	And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,
	Were growing time once ripen'd to my will.
	For your partaker Pole and you yourself,
	I'll note you in my book of memory,
	To scourge you for this apprehension:
	Look to it well and say you are well warn'd.

<MORTIMER>	<36%>
	Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,
	Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.
	Even like a man new haled from the rack,
	So fare my limbs with long imprisonment;
	And these gray locks, the pursuivants of death,
	Nestor-like aged, in an age of care,
	Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.
	These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,
	Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;
	Weak shoulders, overborne with burdening grief,
	And pithless arms, like to a wither'd vine
	That droops his sapless branches to the ground:
	Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,
	Unable to support this lump of clay,
	Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,
	As witting I no other comfort have.
	But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?
</MORTIMER>

<KEEPER 1>	<37%>
	Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:
	We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber.
	And answer was return'd that he will come.
</KEEPER 1>

<MORTIMER>	<37%>
	Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.
	Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.
	Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,
	Before whose glory I was great in arms,
	This loathsome sequestration have I had;
	And even since then hath Richard been obscur'd,
	Depriv'd of honour and inheritance.
	But now the arbitrator of despairs,
	Just death, kind umpire of men's miseries,
	With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:
	I would his troubles likewise were expir'd,
	That so he might recover what was lost.

	Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly us'd,
	Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes.
</PLANTAGENET>

<MORTIMER>	<38%>
	Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,
	And in his bosom spend my latter gasp:
	O! tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,
	That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.
	And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,
	Why didst thou say of late thou wert despis'd?
</MORTIMER>

<PLANTAGENET>	<38%>
	First, lean thine aged back against mine arm;
	And in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.
	This day, in argument upon a case,
	Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;
	Among which terms he us'd a lavish tongue
	And did upbraid me with my father's death:
	Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,
	Else with the like I had requited him.
	Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,
	In honour of a true Plantagenet,
	And for alliance sake, declare the cause
	My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.
</PLANTAGENET>

<MORTIMER>	<38%>
	That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me,
	And hath detain'd me all my flow'ring youth
	Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,
	Was cursed instrument of his decease.
</MORTIMER>

<PLANTAGENET>	<38%>
	Discover more at large what cause that was,
	For I am ignorant and cannot guess.
</PLANTAGENET>

<MORTIMER>	<38%>
	I will, if that my fading breath permit,
	And death approach not ere my tale be done.
	Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,
	Depos'd his nephew Richard, Edward's son,
	The first-begotten, and the lawful heir
	Of Edward king, the third of that descent:
	During whose reign the Percies of the North,
	Finding his usurpation most unjust,
	Endeavour'd my advancement to the throne.
	The reason mov'd these warlike lords to this
	Was, for that—young King Richard thus remov'd,
	Leaving no heir begotten of his body—
	I was the next by birth and parentage;
	For by my mother I derived am
	From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son
	To King Edward the Third; whereas he
	From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,
	Being but fourth of that heroic line.
	But mark: as, in this haughty great attempt
	They laboured to plant the rightful heir,
	I lost my liberty, and they their lives.
	Long after this, when Henry the Fifth
	Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,
	Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then deriv'd
	From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,
	Marrying my sister that thy mother was,
	Again in pity of my hard distress
	Levied an army, weening to redeem
	And have install'd me in the diadem;
	But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl,
	And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,
	In whom the title rested, were suppress'd.
</MORTIMER>

<PLANTAGENET>	<39%>
	Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.
</PLANTAGENET>

<MORTIMER>	<39%>
	True; and thou seest that I no issue have,
	And that my fainting words do warrant death:
	Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather:
	But yet be wary in thy studious care.
</MORTIMER>

<PLANTAGENET>	<40%>
	Thy grave admonishments prevail with me.
	But yet methinks my father's execution
	Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.
</PLANTAGENET>

<MORTIMER>	<40%>
	With silence, nephew, be thou politic:
	Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,
	And like a mountain, not to be remov'd.
	But now thy uncle is removing hence,
	As princes do their courts, when they are cloy'd
	With long continuance in a settled place.

	O uncle! would some part of my young years
	Might but redeem the passage of your age.

	Thou dost then wrong me,—as the slaughterer doth,
	Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.—

	Keepers, convey him hence; and I myself
	Will see his burial better than his life.

	Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,

	No one but he should be about the king;

<JOAN>	<56%>
	Look on thy country, look on fertile France,
	And see the cities and the towns defac'd
	By wasting ruin of the cruel foe.
	As looks the mother on her lowly babe
	When death doth close his tender dying eyes,
	See, see the pining malady of France;
	Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,
	Which thou thyself hast giv'n her woeful breast.
	O! turn thy edged sword another way;
	Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help.
	One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom,
	Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore:
	Return thee therefore, with a flood of tears,
	And wash away thy country's stained spots.

	Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,
	Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.
	Who join'st thou with but with a lordly nation
	That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?
	When Talbot hath set footing once in France,
	And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,
	Who then but English Henry will be lord,
	And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?
	Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof,
	Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe,
	And was he not in England prisoner?
	But when they heard he was thine enemy,
	They set him free, without his ransom paid,
	In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.
	See then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen!
	And join'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.
	Come, come, return; return thou wand'ring lord;
	Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.
</JOAN>

<BURGUNDY>	<57%>
	I am vanquished; these haughty words of hers
	Have batter'd me like roaring cannon-shot,
	And made me almost yield upon my knees.
	Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen!

	My forces and my power of men are yours.
	So, farewell, Talbot; I'll no longer trust thee.

</STAGE DIR>
<FASTOLFE>	<60%>
	My gracious sovereign; as I rode from Calais,

	Writ to your Grace from the Duke of Burgundy.
</FASTOLFE>

<TALBOT>	<60%>
	Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!
	I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next,
	To tear the garter from thy craven's leg;
<STAGE DIR>
<Plucking it off.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Which I have done, because unworthily
	Thou wast installed in that high degree.
	Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest:
	This dastard, at the battle of Patay,
	When but in all I was six thousand strong,
	And that the French were almost ten to one,
	Before we met or that a stroke was given,
	Like to a trusty squire did run away:
	In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;
	Myself, and divers gentlemen beside,
	Were there surpris'd and taken prisoners.
	Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss;
	Or whether that such cowards ought to wear
	This ornament of knighthood, yea, or no?
</TALBOT>

<GLOUCESTER>	<60%>
	To say the truth, this fact was infamous
	And ill beseeming any common man,
	Much more a knight, a captain and a leader.
</GLOUCESTER>

<TALBOT>	<60%>
	When first this order was ordain'd, my lords,
	Knights of the garter were of noble birth,
	Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,
	Such as were grown to credit by the wars;
	Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,
	But always resolute in most extremes.
	He then that is not furnish'd in this sort
	Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,
	Profaning this most honourable order;
	And should—if I were worthy to be judge—
	Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain
	That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.

	What's here? I have, upon especial cause,
	Mov'd with compassion of my country's wrack,
	Together with the pitiful complaints
	Of such as your oppression feeds upon,
	Forsaken your pernicious faction,
	And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.

	Crossing the sea from England into France,
	This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,

	Did represent my master's blushing cheeks,
	When stubbornly he did repugn the truth
	About a certain question in the law
	Argu'd betwixt the Duke of York and him;
	With other vile and ignominious terms:
	In confutation of which rude reproach,
	And in defence of my lord's worthiness,
	I crave the benefit of law of arms.
</BASSET>

<VERNON>	<63%>
	And that is my petition, noble lord:
	For though he seem with forged quaint conceit,
	To set a gloss upon his bold intent,
	Yet know, my lord, I was provok'd by him;

	Pronouncing, that the paleness of this flower
	Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.

	To trouble and disturb the king and us?—
	And you, my lords, methinks you do not well

	Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,
	Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.
	And you, my lords, remember where we are;
	In France, amongst a fickle wav'ring nation.
	If they perceive dissension in our looks,
	And that within ourselves we disagree,
	How will their grudging stomachs be provok'd
	To wilful disobedience, and rebel!
	Beside, what infamy will there arise,
	When foreign princes shall be certified
	That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
	King Henry's peers and chief nobility
	Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!
	O! think upon the conquest of my father,
	My tender years, and let us not forego
	That for a trifle that was bought with blood!
	Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
	I see no reason, if I wear this rose,
<STAGE DIR>
<Putting on a red rose.>
</STAGE DIR>
	That any one should therefore be suspicious
	I more incline to Somerset than York:
	Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.
	As well they may upbraid me with my crown,
	Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown'd.
	But your discretions better can persuade
	Than I am able to instruct or teach:
	And therefore, as we hither came in peace,
	So let us still continue peace and love.
	Cousin of York, we institute your Grace
	To be our regent in these parts of France:
	And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite
	Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;
	And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
	Go cheerfully together and digest
	Your angry choler on your enemies.
	Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest,
	After some respite will return to Calais;
	From thence to England; where I hope ere long
	To be presented by your victories,

	Lo! there thou stand'st, a breathing valiant man,

	It is too late; I cannot send them now:

	Too rashly plotted: all our general force

	Hath sullied all his gloss of former honour

	Cries out for noble York and Somerset,

	Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs,
	And, in advantage lingering, looks for rescue,
	You, his false hopes, the trust of England's honour,
	Keep off aloof with worthless emulation.
	Let not your private discord keep away
	The levied succours that should lend him aid,
	While he, renowned noble gentleman,
	Yields up his life unto a world of odds:
	Orleans the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy,

<TALBOT>	<72%>
	O young John Talbot! I did send for thee
	To tutor thee in stratagems of war,
	That Talbot's name might be in thee reviv'd
	When sapless age, and weak unable limbs
	Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.
	But,—O malignant and ill-boding stars!
	Now thou art come unto a feast of death,
	A terrible and unavoided danger:
	Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse,
	And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape
	By sudden flight: come, dally not, be gone.
</TALBOT>

<JOHN>	<72%>
	Is my name Talbot? and am I your son?
	And shall I fly? O! if you love my mother,
	Dishonour not her honourable name,
	To make a bastard and a slave of me:
	The world will say he is not Talbot's blood
	That basely fled when noble Talbot stood.
</JOHN>

<TALBOT>	<72%>
	Fly, to revenge my death, if I be slain.
</TALBOT>

<JOHN>	<73%>
	He that flies so will ne'er return again.
</JOHN>

<TALBOT>	<73%>
	If we both stay, we both are sure to die.
</TALBOT>

<JOHN>	<73%>
	Then let me stay; and, father, do you fly:
	Your loss is great, so your regard should be;
	My worth unknown, no loss is known in me.
	Upon my death the French can little boast;
	In yours they will, in you all hopes are lost.
	Flight cannot stain the honour you have won;
	But mine it will that no exploit have done:
	You fled for vantage everyone will swear;
	But if I bow, they'll say it was for fear.
	There is no hope that ever I will stay
	If the first hour I shrink and run away.
	Here, on my knee, I beg mortality,
	Rather than life preserv'd with infamy.
</JOHN>

<TALBOT>	<73%>
	Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?
</TALBOT>

<JOHN>	<73%>
	Ay, rather than I'll shame my mother's womb.
</JOHN>

<TALBOT>	<73%>
	Upon my blessing I command thee go.

<TALBOT>	<73%>
	Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain.

<JOHN>	<73%>
	You cannot witness for me, being slain.
	If death be so apparent, then both fly.
</JOHN>

<TALBOT>	<73%>
	And leave my followers here to fight and die?
	My age was never tainted with such shame.
</TALBOT>

<JOHN>	<73%>
	And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?
	No more can I be sever'd from your side
	Than can yourself yourself in twain divide.
	Stay, go, do what you will, the like do I;
	For live I will not if my father die.
</JOHN>

<TALBOT>	<74%>
	Then here I take my leave of thee, fair son,
	Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon.
	Come, side by side together live and die,
	And soul with soul from France to heaven fly.

	Saint George and victory! fight, soldiers, fight!

	Where is John Talbot? Pause, and take thy breath:
	I gave thee life and rescu'd thee from death.
</TALBOT>

<JOHN>	<74%>
	O! twice my father, twice am I thy son:
	The life thou gav'st me first was lost and done,
	Till with thy war-like sword, despite of fate,
	To my determin'd time thou gav'st new date.
</JOHN>

<TALBOT>	<74%>
	When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire,
	It warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire
	Of bold-fac'd victory. Then leaden age,
	Quicken'd with youthful spleen and war-like rage,
	Beat down Alençon, Orleans, Burgundy,
	And from the pride of Gallia rescu'd thee.
	The ireful bastard Orleans,—that drew blood
	From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood
	Of thy first fight,—I soon encountered
	And, interchanging blows, I quickly shed
	Some of his bastard blood; and, in disgrace,
	Bespoke him thus, 'Contaminated, base,
	And misbegotten blood I spill of thine,
	Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine
	Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy:'
	Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy,
	Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father's care,
	Art thou not weary, John? How dost thou fare?
	Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,
	Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry?
	Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead;
	The help of one stands me in little stead.
	O! too much folly is it, well I wot,
	To hazard all our lives in one small boat.
	If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage,
	To-morrow I shall die with mickle age:
	By me they nothing gain an if I stay;
	'Tis but the short'ning of my life one day.
	In thee thy mother dies, our household's name,
	My death's revenge, thy youth, and England's fame.
	All these and more we hazard by thy stay;
	All these are sav'd if thou wilt fly away.
</TALBOT>

<JOHN>	<75%>
	The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart;
	These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart.
	On that advantage, bought with such a shame,
	To save a paltry life and slay bright fame,
	Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly,
	The coward horse that bears me fall and die!
	And like me to the peasant boys of France,
	To be shame's scorn and subject of mischance!
	Surely, by all the glory you have won,
	An if I fly, I am not Talbot's son:
	Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot;
	If son to Talbot, die at Talbot's foot.
</JOHN>

<TALBOT>	<76%>
	Then follow thou thy desperate sire of Crete,
	Thou Icarus. Thy life to me is sweet:
	If thou wilt fight, fight by thy father's side,

	When he perceiv'd me shrink and on my knee,
	His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,
	And like a hungry lion did commence
	Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;
	But when my angry guardant stood alone,
	Tendering my ruin and assail'd of none,
	Dizzy-ey'd fury and great rage of heart
	Suddenly made him from my side to start
	Into the clust'ring battle of the French;

	Damsel of France, I think I have you fast:

	Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner.
<STAGE DIR>
<Gazes on her.>
</STAGE DIR>
	O fairest beauty! do not fear nor fly,

	I kiss these fingers for eternal peace,
	And lay them gently on thy tender side.
	What art thou? say, that I may honour thee.
</SUFFOLK>

<MARGARET>	<85%>
	Margaret my name, and daughter to a king,
	The King of Naples, whosoe'er thou art.
</MARGARET>

<SUFFOLK>	<85%>
	An earl I am, and Suffolk am I call'd.
	Be not offended, nature's miracle,
	Thou art allotted to be ta'en by me:
	So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,
	Keeping them prisoners underneath her wings.
	Yet if this servile usage once offend,
	Go and be free again, as Suffolk's friend.
<STAGE DIR>
<She turns away as going.>
</STAGE DIR>
	O stay! I have no power to let her pass;
	My hand would free her, but my heart says no.
	As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,
	Twinkling another counterfeited beam,
	So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.
	Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak:
	I'll call for pen and ink and write my mind.
	Fie, De la Pole! disable not thyself;
	Hast not a tongue? is she not here thy prisoner?
	Wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight?
	Ay; beauty's princely majesty is such
	Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.
</SUFFOLK>

<MARGARET>	<86%>
	Say, Earl of Suffolk,—if thy name be so,—
	What ransom must I pay before I pass?

</MARGARET>

</STAGE DIR> He talks of wood: it is some carpenter.
</MARGARET>

<SUFFOLK>	<86%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,
	And peace established between these realms.
	But there remains a scruple in that too;

	Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,
	And our nobility will scorn the match.

<SUFFOLK>	<87%>
	Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose
	Your bondage happy to be made a queen?
</SUFFOLK>

<MARGARET>	<87%>
	To be a queen in bondage is more vile
	Than is a slave in base servility;
	For princes should be free.
</MARGARET>

<SUFFOLK>	<87%>
	And so shall you,

</SUFFOLK>

<MARGARET>	<87%>
	Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?

<MARGARET>	<88%>
	I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.

	No, gentle madam; I unworthy am

	And have no portion in the choice myself.
	How say you, madam, are you so content?
</SUFFOLK>

<MARGARET>	<88%>
	An if my father please, I am content.
</MARGARET>

	Suffolk, what remedy?
	I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,

<SUFFOLK>	<88%>
	Yes, there is remedy enough; my lord:
	Consent, and for thy honour, give consent,
	Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king,
	Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto;
	And this her easy-held imprisonment
	Hath gain'd thy daughter princely liberty.
</SUFFOLK>

<REIGNIER>	<88%>
	Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?
</REIGNIER>

<SUFFOLK>	<88%>
	Fair Margaret knows

	Welcome, brave earl, into our territories:

</REIGNIER>

<SUFFOLK>	<89%>
	Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,
	Fit to be made companion with a king.
	What answer makes your Grace unto my suit?
</SUFFOLK>

<REIGNIER>	<89%>
	Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
	To be the princely bride of such a lord,
	Upon condition I may quietly
	Enjoy mine own, the county Maine and Anjou,
	Free from oppression or the stroke of war,
	My daughter shall be Henry's if he please.
</REIGNIER>

<SUFFOLK>	<89%>
	That is her ransom; I deliver her;
	And those two counties I will undertake
	Your Grace shall well and quietly enjoy.
</SUFFOLK>

<REIGNIER>	<89%>
	And I again, in Henry's royal name,
	As deputy unto that gracious king,
	Give thee her hand for sign of plighted faith.
</REIGNIER>

<SUFFOLK>	<89%>
	Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,
	Because this is in traffic of a king:
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> And yet, methinks, I could be well content
	To be mine own attorney in this case.
	I'll over then, to England with this news,
	And make this marriage to be solemniz'd.
	So farewell, Reignier: set this diamond safe,
	In golden palaces, as it becomes.
</SUFFOLK>

	I do embrace thee, as I would embrace

	Yes, my good lord; a pure unspotted heart,

	O! wert thou for myself! But Suffolk, stay;

	Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:
	Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount
	And natural graces that extinguish art;
	Repeat their semblance often on the seas,

	Out, out! My lords, an please you, 'tis not so;

</SHEPHERD>

<WARWICK>	<91%>
	Graceless! wilt thou deny thy parentage?

	Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!

	Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time
	Of thy nativity! I would the milk
	Thy mother gave thee, when thou suck'dst her breast,
	Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!
	Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field

</YORK>

<JOAN>	<92%>
	First, let me tell you whom you have condemn'd:
	Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,
	But issu'd from the progeny of kings;
	Virtuous and holy; chosen from above,
	By inspiration of celestial grace,
	To work exceeding miracles on earth.
	I never had to do with wicked spirits:
	But you,—that are polluted with your lusts,
	Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents,
	Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,—
	Because you want the grace that others have,
	You judge it straight a thing impossible
	To compass wonders but by help of devils.
	No misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been
	A virgin from her tender infancy,
	Chaste and immaculate in very thought;
	Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effus'd,
	Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.
</JOAN>

<YORK>	<92%>
	Ay, ay: away with her to execution!
</YORK>

<WARWICK>	<92%>
	And hark ye, sirs; because she is a maid,
	Spare for no fagots, let there be enow:
	Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake,
	That so her torture may be shortened.
</WARWICK>

<JOAN>	<92%>
	Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?
	Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity;
	That warranteth by law to be thy privilege.
	I am with child, ye bloody homicides:
	Murder not then the fruit within my womb,
	Although ye hale me to a violent death.

	Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.
</YORK>

<JOAN>	<93%>
	Then lead me hence; with whom I leave my curse:
	May never glorious sun reflex his beams

</CARDINAL>

	Is all our travail turn'd to this effect?
	After the slaughter of so many peers,
	So many captains, gentlemen, and soldiers,
	That in this quarrel have been overthrown,
	And sold their bodies for their country's benefit,
	Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?
	Have we not lost most part of all the towns,
	By treason, falsehood, and by treachery,
	Our great progenitors had conquered?
	O! Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief
	The utter loss of all the realm of France.
</YORK>

<WARWICK>	<94%>
	Be patient, York: if we conclude a peace,

	You shall become true liegemen to his crown:
	And, Charles, upon-condition thou wilt swear
	To pay him tribute, and submit thyself,
	Thou shalt be plac'd as viceroy under him,
	And still enjoy thy regal dignity.
</CARDINAL>

<ALENÇON>	<95%>
	Must he be then, as shadow of himself?
	Adorn his temples with a coronet,
	And yet, in substance and authority,
	Retain but privilege of a private man?
	This proffer is absurd and reasonless.
</ALENÇON>

<CHARLES>	<95%>
	'Tis known already that I am possess'd
	With more than half the Gallian territories,
	And therein reverenc'd for their lawful king:
	Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd,
	Detract so much from that prerogative
	As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole?
	No, lord ambassador; I'll rather keep
	That which I have than, coveting for more,
	Be cast from possibility of all.
</CHARLES>

<YORK>	<95%>
	Insulting Charles! hast thou by secret means
	Us'd intercession to obtain a league,
	And now the matter grows to compromise,
	Stand'st thou aloof upon comparison?
	Either accept the title thou usurp'st,
	Of benefit proceeding from our king
	And not of any challenge of desert,
	Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.
</YORK>

<REIGNIER>	<96%>
	My lord, you do not well in obstinacy

<Aside to Charles.>
</STAGE DIR> To say the truth, it is your policy

</ALENÇON>

<WARWICK>	<96%>
	How sayst thou, Charles? shall our condition stand?

<K. HENRY>	<97%>
	Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,
	Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:
	Her virtues, graced with external gifts
	Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:
	And like as rigour of tempestuous gusts
	Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,
	So am I driven by breath of her renown
	Either to suffer shipwrack, or arrive
	Where I may have fruition of her love.
</K. HENRY>

<SUFFOLK>	<97%>
	Tush! my good lord, this superficial tale
	Is but a preface of her worthy praise:
	The chief perfections of that lovely dame—
	Had I sufficient skill to utter them—
	Would make a volume of enticing lines,
	Able to ravish any dull conceit:
	And, which is more, she is not so divine,
	So full replete with choice of all delights,
	But with as humble lowliness of mind
	She is content to be at your command;
	Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,
	To love and honour Henry as her lord.
</SUFFOLK>

<K. HENRY>	<97%>
	And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.
	Therefore, my Lord Protector, give consent
	That Margaret may be England's royal queen.
</K. HENRY>

<GLOUCESTER>	<97%>
	So should I give consent to flatter sin.
	You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd
	Unto another lady of esteem;
	How shall we then dispense with that contract,
	And not deface your honour with reproach?
</GLOUCESTER>

<SUFFOLK>	<97%>
	As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;
	Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd
	To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists
	By reason of his adversary's odds.
	A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
	And therefore may be broke without offence.
</SUFFOLK>

<GLOUCESTER>	<98%>
	Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?
	Her father is no better than an earl,
	Although in glorious titles he excel.
</GLOUCESTER>

<SUFFOLK>	<98%>
	Yes, my good lord, her father is a king,
	The King of Naples and Jerusalem;
	And of such great authority in France
	As his alliance will confirm our peace,
	And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.
</SUFFOLK>

<GLOUCESTER>	<98%>
	And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,
	Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.
</GLOUCESTER>

<EXETER>	<98%>
	Beside, his wealth doth warrant liberal dower,
	Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.
</EXETER>

<SUFFOLK>	<98%>
	A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,
	That he should be so abject, base, and poor,
	To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.
	Henry is able to enrich his queen,
	And not to seek a queen to make him rich:
	So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,
	As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.
	Marriage is a matter of more worth
	Than to be dealt in by attorneyship:
	Not whom we will, but whom his Grace affects,
	Must be companion of his nuptial bed;
	And therefore, lords, since he affects her most
	It most of all these reasons bindeth us,
	In our opinions she should be preferr'd.
	For what is wedlock forced, but a hell,
	An age of discord and continual strife?
	Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,
	And is a pattern of celestial peace.
	Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,
	But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?
	Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,
	Approves her fit for none but for a king:
	Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit—
	More than in women commonly is seen—
	Will answer our hope in issue of a king;
	For Henry, son unto a conqueror,
	Is likely to beget more conquerors,
	If with a lady of so high resolve
	As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.
	Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me
	That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.
</SUFFOLK>

<K. HENRY>	<99%>
	Whether it be through force of your report,
	My noble lord of Suffolk, or for that
	My tender youth was never yet attaint
	With any passion of inflaming love,
	I cannot tell; but this I am assur'd,
	I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,
	Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,
	As I am sick with working of my thoughts.
	Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;
	Agree to any covenants, and procure
	That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come
	To cross the seas to England and be crown'd
	King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:
	For your expenses and sufficient charge,
	Among the people gather up a tenth.
	Be gone, I say; for till you do return
	I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.
	And you, good uncle, banish all offence:
	If you do censure me by what you were,
	Not what you are, I know it will excuse
	This sudden execution of my will.
	And so, conduct me, where, from company
	I may revolve and ruminate my grief.
</K. HENRY>

<GLOUCESTER>	<100%>
	Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.

<Exeunt Gloucester and Exeter.>
</STAGE DIR>

<SUFFOLK>	<100%>
	Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes,
	As did the youthful Paris once to Greece;
	With hope to find the like event in love,
	But prosper better than the Trojan did.
	Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king;
	But I will rule both her, the king, and realm.
