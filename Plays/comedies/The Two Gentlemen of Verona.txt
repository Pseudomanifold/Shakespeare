<ACT 1>


<SCENE 1>
<Verona. An open place.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Valentine and Proteus.>
</STAGE DIR>
<VALENTINE>	<0%>
	Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
	Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
	Were't not affection chains thy tender days
	To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
	I rather would entreat thy company
	To see the wonders of the world abroad
	Than, living dully sluggardiz'd at home,
	Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
	But since thou lov'st, love still, and thrive therein,
	Even as I would when I to love begin.
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<1%>
	Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
	Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
	Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
	Wish me partaker in thy happiness
	When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
	If ever danger do environ thee,
	Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
	For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<1%>
	And on a love-book pray for my success?
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<1%>
	Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<1%>
	That's on some shallow story of deep love,
	How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<1%>
	That's a deep story of a deeper love;
	For he was more than over shoes in love.
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<1%>
	'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
	And yet you never swum the Hellespont.
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<2%>
	Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<2%>
	No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<2%>
	What?
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<2%>
	To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;
	Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth
	With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:
	If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
	If lost, why then a grievous labour won:
	However, but a folly bought with wit,
	Or else a wit by folly vanquished.
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<2%>
	So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<2%>
	So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<2%>
	'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<2%>
	Love is your master, for he masters you;
	And he that is so yoked by a fool,
	Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<2%>
	Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
	The eating canker dwells, so eating love
	Inhabits in the finest wits of all.
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<2%>
	And writers say, as the most forward bud
	Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
	Even so by love the young and tender wit
	Is turned to folly; blasting in the bud,
	Losing his verdure even in the prime,
	And all the fair effects of future hopes.
	But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee
	That art a votary to fond desire?
	Once more adieu! my father at the road
	Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<3%>
	And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<3%>
	Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.
	To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
	Of thy success in love, and what news else
	Betideth here in absence of thy friend;
	And I likewise will visit thee with mine.
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<3%>
	All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<3%>
	As much to you at home! and so, farewell.
</VALENTINE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<PROTEUS>	<3%>
	He after honour hunts, I after love:
	He leaves his friends to dignify them more;
	I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.
	Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphos'd me;—
	Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
	War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
	Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.

</PROTEUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Speed.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SPEED>	<4%>
	Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<4%>
	But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<4%>
	Twenty to one, then, he is shipp'd already,
	And I have play'd the sheep, in losing him.
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<4%>
	Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,
	An if the shepherd be a while away.
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<4%>
	You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then, and I a sheep?
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<4%>
	I do.
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<4%>
	Why then my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<4%>
	A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<4%>
	This proves me still a sheep.
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<4%>
	True, and thy master a shepherd.
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<4%>
	Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<4%>
	It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<4%>
	The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks not me: therefore I am no sheep.
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<4%>
	The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd, the shepherd for food follows not the sheep; thou for wages followest thy master, thy master for wages follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<5%>
	Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<5%>
	But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia?
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<5%>
	Ay, sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a laced mutton; and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a lost mutton, nothing for my labour.
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<5%>
	Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<5%>
	If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<5%>
	Nay, in that you are astray; 'twere best pound you.
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<5%>
	Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter.
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<5%>
	You mistake: I mean the pound,—a pinfold.
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<5%>
	From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,
	'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover.
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<5%>
	But what said she? <STAGE DIR>
<Speed nods.>
</STAGE DIR> Did she nod?
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<5%>
	Ay.
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<5%>
	Nod, ay? why, that's noddy.
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<5%>
	You mistook, sir: I say she did nod; and you ask me if she did nod; and I say, Ay.
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<5%>
	And that set together is—noddy.
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<5%>
	Now you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for your pains.
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<6%>
	No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<6%>
	Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<6%>
	Why, sir, how do you bear with me?
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<6%>
	Marry, sir, the letter very orderly; having nothing but the word 'noddy' for my pains.
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<6%>
	Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<6%>
	And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<6%>
	Come, come; open the matter in brief: what said she?
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<6%>
	Open your purse, that the money and the matter may be both at once delivered.
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<6%>
	Well, sir, here is for your pains <STAGE DIR>
<giving him money].>
</STAGE DIR> What said she?
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<6%>
	Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<6%>
	Why? couldst thou perceive so much from her?
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<6%>
	Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter. And being so hard to me that brought your mind, I fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your mind. Give her no token but stones, for she's as hard as steel.
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<6%>
	What! said she nothing?
</PROTEUS>

<SPEED>	<7%>
	No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your letters yourself. And so, sir, I'll commend you to my master.
</SPEED>

<PROTEUS>	<7%>
	Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wrack;
	Which cannot perish, having thee aboard,
	Being destin'd to a drier death on shore.—
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Speed.>
</STAGE DIR>
	I must go send some better messenger:
	I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,
	Receiving them from such a worthless post.
</PROTEUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>

</SCENE 1>


<SCENE 2>
<The Same. The Garden of Julia's House.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Julia and Lucetta.>
</STAGE DIR>
<JULIA>	<7%>
	But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
	Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<7%>
	Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<7%>
	Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
	That every day with parle encounter me,
	In thy opinion which is worthiest love?
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<7%>
	Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind
	According to my shallow simple skill.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<8%>
	What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<8%>
	As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine;
	But, were I you, he never should be mine.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<8%>
	What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<8%>
	Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<8%>
	What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<8%>
	Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<8%>
	How now! what means this passion at his name?
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<8%>
	Pardon, dear madam; 'tis a passing shame
	That I, unworthy body as I am,
	Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<8%>
	Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<8%>
	Then thus,—of many good I think him best.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<8%>
	Your reason?
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<8%>
	I have no other but a woman's reason:
	I think him so because I think him so.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<8%>
	And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<8%>
	Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<8%>
	Why, he, of all the rest hath never mov'd me.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<8%>
	Yet he of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<8%>
	His little speaking shows his love but small.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<8%>
	Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<9%>
	They do not love that do not show their love.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<9%>
	O! they love least that let men know their love.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<9%>
	I would I knew his mind.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<9%>
	Peruse this paper, madam.
</LUCETTA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Gives a letter.>
</STAGE DIR>

<JULIA>	<9%>
	'To Julia.'—Say from whom?
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<9%>
	That the contents will show.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<9%>
	Say, say, who gave it thee?
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<9%>
	Sir Valentine's page, and sent, I think, from Proteus.
	He would have given it you, but I, being in the way,
	Did in your name receive it; pardon the fault, I pray.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<9%>
	Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
	Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
	To whisper and conspire against my youth?
	Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
	And you an officer fit for the place.
	There, take the paper: see it be return'd;
	Or else return no more into my sight.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<9%>
	To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<9%>
	Will ye be gone?
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<9%>
	That you may ruminate.
</LUCETTA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<JULIA>	<9%>
	And yet I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
	It were a shame to call her back again
	And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
	What fool is she, that knows I am a maid,
	And would not force the letter to my view!
	Since maids, in modesty, say 'No' to that
	Which they would have the profferer construe 'Ay.'
	Fie, fie! how wayward is this foolish love
	That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse
	And presently all humbled kiss the rod!
	How churlishly I child Lucetta hence,
	When willingly I would have had her here:
	How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
	When inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile.
	My penance is, to call Lucetta back
	And ask remission for my folly past.
	What ho! Lucetta!

</JULIA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Lucetta.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LUCETTA>	<10%>
	What would your ladyship?
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<10%>
	Is it near dinner-time?
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<10%>
	I would it were;
	That you might kill your stomach on your meat
	And not upon your maid.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<10%>
	What is't that you took up so gingerly?
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<10%>
	Nothing.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<10%>
	Why didst thou stoop, then?
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<10%>
	To take a paper up
	That I let fall.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<10%>
	And is that paper nothing?
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<11%>
	Nothing concerning me.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<11%>
	Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<11%>
	Madam, it will not lie where it concerns,
	Unless it have a false interpreter.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<11%>
	Some love of yours hath writ to you in rime.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<11%>
	That I might sing it, madam, to a tune:
	Give me a note: your ladyship can set.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<11%>
	As little by such toys as may be possible;
	Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' Love.'
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<11%>
	It is too heavy for so light a tune.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<11%>
	Heavy! belike it hath some burden, then?
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<11%>
	Ay; and melodious were it, would you sing it.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<11%>
	And why not you?
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<11%>
	I cannot reach so high.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<11%>
	Let's see your song. <STAGE DIR>
<Taking the letter.>
</STAGE DIR> How now, minion!
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<11%>
	Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:
	And yet methinks, I do not like this tune.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<11%>
	You do not?
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<11%>
	No, madam; it is too sharp.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<11%>
	You, minion, are too saucy.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<11%>
	Nay, now you are too flat
	And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:
	There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<12%>
	The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<12%>
	Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<12%>
	This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
	Here is a coil with protestation!—
<STAGE DIR>
<Tears the letter.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Go, get you gone, and let the papers lie:
	You would be fingering them, to anger me.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<12%>
	She makes it strange; but she would be best pleas'd
	To be so anger'd with another letter.
</LUCETTA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<JULIA>	<12%>
	Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!
	O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
	Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
	And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
	I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
	Look, here is writ 'kind Julia:' unkind Julia!
	As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
	I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
	Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
	And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus:'
	Poor wounded name! my bosom, as a bed
	Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal'd;
	And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
	But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down:
	Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
	Till I have found each letter in the letter,
	Except mine own name; that some whirlwind bear
	Unto a ragged, fearful hanging rock,
	And throw it thence into the raging sea!
	Lo! here in one line is his name twice writ,
	'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
	To the sweet Julia':—that I'll tear away;
	And yet I will not, sith so prettily
	He couples it to his complaining names:
	Thus will I fold them one upon another:
	Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.

</JULIA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Lucetta.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LUCETTA>	<13%>
	Madam,
	Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<13%>
	Well, let us go.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<13%>
	What! shall these papers he like tell-tales here?
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<13%>
	If you respect them, best to take them up.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<13%>
	Nay, I was taken up for laying them down;
	Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<13%>
	I see you have a month's mind to them.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<13%>
	Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;
	I see things too, although you judge I wink.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<13%>
	Come, come; will't please you go?

<SCENE 3>
<The Same. A Room in Antonio's House.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Antonio and Panthino.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ANTONIO>	<14%>
	Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
	Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?
</ANTONIO>

<PANTHINO>	<14%>
	'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.
</PANTHINO>

<ANTONIO>	<14%>
	Why, what of him?
</ANTONIO>

<PANTHINO>	<14%>
	He wonder'd that your lordship
	Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,
	While other men, of slender reputation,
	Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:
	Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;
	Some to discover islands far away;
	Some to the studious universities.
	For any or for all these exercises
	He said that Proteus your son was meet,
	And did request me to importune you
	To let him spend his time no more at home,
	Which would be great impeachment to his age,
	In having known to travel in his youth.
</PANTHINO>

<ANTONIO>	<14%>
	Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
	Whereon this month I have been hammering.
	I have consider'd well his loss of time,
	And how he cannot be a perfect man,
	Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:
	Experience is by industry achiev'd
	And perfected by the swift course of time.
	Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?
</ANTONIO>

<PANTHINO>	<15%>
	I think your lordship is not ignorant
	How his companion, youthful Valentine,
	Attends the emperor in his royal court.
</PANTHINO>

<ANTONIO>	<15%>
	I know it well.
</ANTONIO>

<PANTHINO>	<15%>
	'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:
	There shall be practise tilts and tournaments,
	Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen,
	And be in eye of every exercise
	Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.
</PANTHINO>

<ANTONIO>	<15%>
	I like thy counsel, well hast thou advis'd:
	And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it
	The execution of it shall make known.
	Even with the speediest expedition
	I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.
</ANTONIO>

<PANTHINO>	<15%>
	To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso
	With other gentlemen of good esteem,
	Are journeying to salute the emperor
	And to commend their service to his will.
</PANTHINO>

<ANTONIO>	<15%>
	Good company; with them shall Proteus go:
	And in good time:—now will we break with him.

</ANTONIO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Proteus.>
</STAGE DIR>
<PROTEUS>	<16%>
	Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!
	Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;
	Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
	O! that our fathers would applaud our loves,
	To seal our happiness with their consents!
	O heavenly Julia!

<ANTONIO>	<16%>
	How now! what letter are you reading there?
</ANTONIO>

<PROTEUS>	<16%>
	May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two
	Of commendations sent from Valentine,
	Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.
</PROTEUS>

<ANTONIO>	<16%>
	Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
</ANTONIO>

<PROTEUS>	<16%>
	There is no news, my lord; but that he writes
	How happily he lives, how well belov'd
	And daily graced by the emperor;
	Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.
</PROTEUS>

<ANTONIO>	<16%>
	And how stand you affected to his wish?
</ANTONIO>

<PROTEUS>	<16%>
	As one relying on your lordship's will
	And not depending on his friendly wish.
</PROTEUS>

<ANTONIO>	<16%>
	My will is something sorted with his wish.
	Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;
	For what I will, I will, and there an end.
	I am resolv'd that thou shalt spend some time
	With Valentinus in the emperor's court:
	What maintenance he from his friends receives,
	Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.
	To-morrow be in readiness to go:
	Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.
</ANTONIO>

<PROTEUS>	<17%>
	My lord, I cannot be so soon provided:
	Please you, deliberate a day or two.
</PROTEUS>

<ANTONIO>	<17%>
	Look, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee:
	No more of stay; to-morrow thou must go.
	Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ'd
	To hasten on his expedition.
</ANTONIO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Antonio and Panthino.>

<PROTEUS>	<17%>
	Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
	And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.
	I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,
	Lest he should take exceptions to my love;
	And with the vantage of mine own excuse
	Hath he excepted most against my love.
	O! how this spring of love resembleth
	The uncertain glory of an April day,
	Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
	And by and by a cloud takes all away!

	Sir, your glove.
</SPEED>
<STAGE DIR>
<Offering a glove.>
</STAGE DIR>

<VALENTINE>	<18%>
	Not mine; my gloves are on.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<18%>
	Why, then this may be yours, for this is but one.
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<18%>
	Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine;
	Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
	Ah Silvia! Silvia!
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<18%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Calling.>
</STAGE DIR> Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<18%>
	How now, sirrah?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<18%>
	She is not within hearing, sir.
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<18%>
	Why, sir, who bade you call her?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<18%>
	Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<18%>
	Well, you'll still be too forward.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<18%>
	And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<18%>
	Go to, sir. Tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<18%>
	She that your worship loves?
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<18%>
	Why, how know you that I am in love?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<19%>
	Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms, like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had the pestilence; to sigh, like a schoolboy that had lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes diet; to watch, like one that fears robbing; to speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look on you, I can hardly think you my master.
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<19%>
	Are all these things perceived in me?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<19%>
	They are all perceived without ye.
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<19%>
	Without me? they cannot.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<19%>
	Without you? nay, that's certain; for, without you were so simple, none else would: but you are so without these follies, that these follies are within you and shine through you like the water in an urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady.
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<20%>
	But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<20%>
	She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<20%>
	Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<20%>
	Why, sir, I know her not.
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<20%>
	Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet knowest her not?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<20%>
	Is she not hard-favoured, sir?
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<20%>
	Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<20%>
	Sir, I know that well enough.
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<20%>
	What dost thou know?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<20%>
	That she is not so fair, as, of you, well-favoured.
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<20%>
	I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<20%>
	That's because the one is painted and the other out of all count.
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<20%>
	How painted? and how out of count?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<20%>
	Marry, sir, so painted to make her fair, that no man counts of her beauty.
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<20%>
	How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<20%>
	You never saw her since she was deformed.
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<20%>
	How long hath she been deformed?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<21%>
	Ever since you loved her.
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<21%>
	I have loved her ever since I saw her, and still I see her beautiful.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<21%>
	If you love her you cannot see her.
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<21%>
	Why?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<21%>
	Because Love is blind. O! that you had mine eyes; or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going ungartered!
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<21%>
	What should I see then?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<21%>
	Your own present folly and her passing deformity: for he, being in love, could not see to garter his hose; and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<21%>
	Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<21%>
	True, sir; I was in love with my bed. I thank you, you swinged me for my love, which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours.
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<21%>
	In conclusion, I stand affected to her.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<21%>
	I would you were set, so your affection would cease.
</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<21%>
	Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to one she loves.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<21%>
	And have you?

<VALENTINE>	<21%>
	I have.

	I thank you, gentle servant. 'Tis very clerkly done.
</SILVIA>

<VALENTINE>	<22%>
	Now, trust me, madam, it came hardly off;
	For, being ignorant to whom it goes
	I writ at random, very doubtfully.
</VALENTINE>

<SILVIA>	<22%>
	Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
</SILVIA>

<VALENTINE>	<22%>
	No, madam; so it stead you, I will write,
	Please you command, a thousand times as much.
	And yet—
</VALENTINE>

<SILVIA>	<23%>
	A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;
	And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;
	And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,
	Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.
</SILVIA>

	What means your ladyship? do you not like it?

	Nay, take them.

<VALENTINE>	<23%>
	Madam, they are for you.
</VALENTINE>

	Ay, ay; you writ them, sir, at my request,

	I would have had them writ more movingly.
</SILVIA>

<VALENTINE>	<23%>
	Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.
</VALENTINE>

<SILVIA>	<23%>
	And when it's writ, for my sake read it over:

</SILVIA>

<VALENTINE>	<23%>
	If it please me, madam, what then?

	By a letter, I should say.

<VALENTINE>	<24%>
	No, believe me.

	No believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceive her earnest?

	She gave me none, except an angry word.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<24%>
	Why, she hath given you a letter.

<VALENTINE>	<24%>
	That's the letter I writ to her friend.

	I would it were no worse.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEED>	<25%>
	I'll warrant you, 'tis as well:
	'For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,
	Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;
	Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,
	Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.'
	All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.

</SPEED>

<VALENTINE>	<25%>
	I have dined.
</VALENTINE>

	Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping: all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I have received my proportion, like the prodigious son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the imperial's court. I think Crab my dog be the sourest-natured dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing her hands, and all our house in a great perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed one tear. He is a stone, a very pebble stone, and has no more pity in him than a dog; a Jew would have wept to have seen our parting: why, my grandam, having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, I'll show you the manner of it. This shoe is my father; no, this left shoe is my father: no, no, this left shoe is my mother; nay, that cannot be so neither:—yes, it is so; it is so; it hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in, is my mother, and this my father. A vengeance on't! there 'tis: now, sir, this staff is my sister; for, look you, she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I am the dog; no, the dog is himself, and I am the dog,—O! the dog is me, and I am myself: ay, so, so. Now come I to my father; 'Father, your blessing;' now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping: now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother;—O, that she could speak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there 'tis; here's my mother's breath up and down. Now come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes: Now the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.

<VALENTINE>	<30%>
	Yourself, sweet lady; for you gave the fire. Sir Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks, and spends what he borrows kindly in your company.

<THURIO>	<31%>
	Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall make your wit bankrupt.
</THURIO>

<VALENTINE>	<31%>
	I know it well, sir: you have an exchequer of words, and, I think, no other treasure to give your followers; for it appears by their bare liveries that they live by your bare words.

<DUKE>	<31%>
	Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.
	Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:
	What say you to a letter from your friends
	Of much good news?
</DUKE>

<VALENTINE>	<31%>
	My lord, I will be thankful
	To any happy messenger from thence.
</VALENTINE>

<DUKE>	<31%>
	Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?
</DUKE>

<VALENTINE>	<31%>
	Ay, my good lord; I know the gentleman
	To be of worth and worthy estimation,
	And not without desert so well reputed.
</VALENTINE>

<DUKE>	<31%>
	Hath he not a son?
</DUKE>

<VALENTINE>	<31%>
	Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves
	The honour and regard of such a father.
</VALENTINE>

<DUKE>	<31%>
	You know him well?
</DUKE>

<VALENTINE>	<32%>
	I know him as myself; for from our infancy
	We have convers'd and spent our hours together:
	And though myself have been an idle truant,
	Omitting the sweet benefit of time
	To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,
	Yet hath Sir Proteus,—for that's his name,—
	Made use and fair advantage of his days:
	His years but young, but his experience old;
	His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe;
	And, in a word,—for far behind his worth
	Come all the praises that I now bestow,—
	He is complete in feature and in mind
	With all good grace to grace a gentleman.
</VALENTINE>

<DUKE>	<32%>
	Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,
	He is as worthy for an empress' love
	As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.
	Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me
	With commendation from great potentates;
	And here he means to spend his time awhile:
	I think, 'tis no unwelcome news to you.
</DUKE>

<VALENTINE>	<32%>
	Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he.
</VALENTINE>

<DUKE>	<32%>
	Welcome him then according to his worth.

</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<35%>
	And how do yours?
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<35%>
	I left them all in health.
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<35%>
	How does your lady and how thrives your love?
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<35%>
	My tales of love were wont to weary you;
	I know you joy not in a love-discourse.
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<35%>
	Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:
	I have done penance for contemning love;
	Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
	With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
	With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;
	For, in revenge of my contempt of love,
	Love hath chas'd sleep from my enthralled eyes,
	And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.
	O, gentle Proteus! Love's a mighty lord,
	And hath so humbled me as I confess,
	There is no woe to his correction,
	Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
	Now no discourse, except it be of love;
	Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,
	Upon the very naked name of love.
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<35%>
	Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
	Was this the idol that you worship so?
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<35%>
	Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<35%>
	No; but she is an earthly paragon.
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<36%>
	Call her divine.
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<36%>
	I will not flatter her.
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<36%>
	O! flatter me, for love delights in praises.
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<36%>
	When I was sick you gave me bitter pills,
	And I must minister the like to you.
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<36%>
	Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
	Yet let her be a principality,
	Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<36%>
	Except my mistress.
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<36%>
	Sweet, except not any,
	Except thou wilt except against my love.
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<36%>
	Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<36%>
	And I will help thee to prefer her too:
	She shall be dignified with this high honour,—
	To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth
	Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss,
	And, of so great a favour growing proud,
	Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower,
	And make rough winter everlastingly.
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<36%>
	Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<36%>
	Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing
	To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing.
	She is alone.
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<36%>
	Then, let her alone.
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<36%>
	Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,
	And I as rich in having such a jewel
	As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
	The water nectar, and the rocks pure gold.
	Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,
	Because thou see'st me dote upon my love.
	My foolish rival, that her father likes
	Only for his possessions are so huge,
	Is gone with her along, and I must after,
	For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<37%>
	But she loves you?
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<37%>
	Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our marriage-hour,
	With all the cunning manner of our flight,
	Determin'd of: how I must climb her window,
	The ladder made of cords, and all the means
	Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.
	Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,
	In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<37%>
	Go on before, I shall inquire you forth:
	I must unto the road, to disembark
	Some necessaries that I needs must use,
	And then I'll presently attend you.

</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<37%>
	I will.

<Exit Valentine.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Even as one heat another heat expels,
	Or as one nail by strength drives out another,
	So the remembrance of my former love
	Is by a newer object quite forgotten.
	Is it mine eye, or Valentinus' praise,
	Her true perfection, or my false transgression,
	That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
	She's fair; and so is Julia that I love,—
	That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd,
	Which, like a waxen image 'gainst a fire,
	Bears no impression of the thing it was.
	Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,
	And that I love him not as I was wont:
	O! but I love his lady too-too much;
	And that's the reason I love him so little.
	How shall I dote on her with more advice,
	That thus without advice begin to love her?
	'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
	And that hath dazzled my reason's light;
	But when I look on her perfections,
	There is no reason but I shall be blind.
	If I can check my erring love, I will;
	If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.

	To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;
	To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;
	To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;
	And even that power which gave me first my oath
	Provokes me to this threefold perjury:
	Love bade me swear, and Love bids me forswear.
	O sweet-suggesting Love! if thou hast sinn'd,
	Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it.
	At first I did adore a twinkling star,
	But now I worship a celestial sun.
	Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken;
	And he wants wit that wants resolved will
	To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.
	Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,
	Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd
	With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.
	I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;
	But there I leave to love where I should love.
	Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:
	If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;
	If I lose them, thus find I by their loss,
	For Valentine, myself; for Julia, Silvia.
	I to myself am dearer than a friend,
	For love is still most precious in itself;
	And Silvia—witness heaven that made her fair!—
	Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
	I will forget that Julia is alive,
	Remembering that my love to her is dead;
	And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,
	Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.
	I cannot now prove constant to myself
	Without some treachery us'd to Valentine:
	This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
	To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,
	Myself in counsel, his competitor.
	Now presently, I'll give her father notice
	Of their disguising and pretended flight;
	Who, all enrag'd, will banish Valentine;
	For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;
	But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross,
	By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.
	Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,

	Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me:

	Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
	Are visibly character'd and engrav'd,
	To lesson me and tell me some good mean
	How, with my honour, I may undertake
	A journey to my loving Proteus.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<43%>
	Alas! the way is wearisome and long.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<43%>
	A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
	To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;
	Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,
	And when the flight is made to one so dear,
	Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<43%>
	Better forbear till Proteus make return.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<43%>
	O! know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
	Pity the dearth that I have pined in,
	By longing for that food so long a time.
	Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,
	Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
	As seek to quench the fire of love with words.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<44%>
	I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
	But qualify the fire's extreme rage,
	Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<44%>
	The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.
	The current that with gentle murmur glides,
	Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;
	But when his fair course is not hindered,
	He makes sweet music with th' enamell'd stones,
	Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
	He overtaketh in his pilgrimage;
	And so by many winding nooks he strays
	With willing sport, to the wild ocean.
	Then let me go and hinder not my course:
	I'll be as patient as a gentle stream
	And make a pastime of each weary step,
	Till the last step have brought me to my love;
	And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil
	A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<44%>
	But in what habit will you go along?
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<44%>
	Not like a woman; for I would prevent
	The loose encounters of lascivious men.
	Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
	As may beseem some well-reputed page.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<44%>
	Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<45%>
	No, girl; I'll knit it up in silken strings
	With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots:
	To be fantastic may become a youth
	Of greater time than I shall show to be.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<45%>
	What fashion, madam, shall I make your breeches?
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<45%>
	That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,
	What compass will you wear your farthingale?'
	Why, even what fashion thou best lik'st, Lucetta.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<45%>
	You must needs have them with a cod-piece, madam.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<45%>
	Out, out, Lucetta! that will be ill-favour'd.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<45%>
	A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,
	Unless you have a cod-piece to stick pins on.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<45%>
	Lucetta, as thou lov'st me, let me have
	What thou think'st meet and is most mannerly.
	But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me
	For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
	I fear me, it will make me scandaliz'd.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<45%>
	If you think so, then stay at home and go not.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<45%>
	Nay, that I will not.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<45%>
	Then never dream on infamy, but go.
	If Proteus like your journey when you come,
	No matter who's displeas'd when you are gone.
	I fear me, he will scarce be pleas'd withal.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<46%>
	That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:
	A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,
	And instances of infinite of love
	Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<46%>
	All these are servants to deceitful men.
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<46%>
	Base men, that use them to so base effect;
	But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth:
	His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,
	His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,
	His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,
	His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.
</JULIA>

<LUCETTA>	<46%>
	Pray heaven he prove so when you come to him!
</LUCETTA>

<JULIA>	<46%>
	Now, as thou lov'st me, do him not that wrong
	To bear a hard opinion of his truth:
	Only deserve my love by loving him,
	And presently go with me to my chamber,
	To take a note of what I stand in need of
	To furnish me upon my longing journey.
	All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,
	My goods, my lands, my reputation;
	Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.
	Come, answer not, but to it presently!
	I am impatient of my tarriance.

	Now tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?
</DUKE>

<PROTEUS>	<47%>
	My gracious lord, that which I would discover
	The law of friendship bids me to conceal;
	But when I call to mind your gracious favours
	Done to me, undeserving as I am,
	My duty pricks me on to utter that
	Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
	Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
	This night intends to steal away your daughter:
	Myself am one made privy to the plot.
	I know you have determin'd to bestow her
	On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;
	And should she thus be stol'n away from you
	It would be much vexation to your age.
	Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose
	To cross my friend in his intended drift,
	Than, by concealing it, heap on your head
	A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
	Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.
</PROTEUS>

<DUKE>	<48%>
	Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care,
	Which to requite, command me while I live.
	This love of theirs myself have often seen,
	Haply, when they have judg'd me fast asleep,
	And oftentimes have purpos'd to forbid
	Sir Valentine her company and my court;
	But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
	And so unworthily disgrace the man,—
	A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,—
	I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
	That which thyself hast now disclos'd to me.
	And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
	Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
	I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,
	The key whereof myself have ever kept;
	And thence she cannot be convey'd away.
</DUKE>

<PROTEUS>	<48%>
	Know, noble lord, they have devis'd a mean
	How he her chamber-window will ascend
	And with a corded ladder fetch her down;
	For which the youthful lover now is gone
	And this way comes he with it presently;
	Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.
	But, good my lord, do it so cunningly
	That my discovery be not aimed at;
	For love of you, not hate unto my friend,
	Hath made me publisher of this pretence.
</PROTEUS>

<DUKE>	<49%>
	Upon mine honour, he shall never know
	That I had any light from thee of this.

<VALENTINE>	<49%>
	Please it your Grace, there is a messenger

</VALENTINE>

<DUKE>	<49%>
	Nay then, no matter: stay with me awhile;
	I am to break with thee of some affairs
	That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.
	'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
	To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.
</DUKE>

<VALENTINE>	<49%>
	I know it well, my lord; and sure, the match
	Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman
	Is full of virtue, bounty, worth, and qualities
	Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter.
	Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?
</VALENTINE>

<DUKE>	<50%>
	No, trust me: she is peevish, sullen, froward,
	Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty;
	Neither regarding that she is my child,
	Nor fearing me as if I were her father:
	And, may I say to thee this pride of hers,
	Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;
	And, where I thought the remnant of mine age
	Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,
	I now am full resolv'd to take a wife
	And turn her out to who will take her in:
	Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;
	For me and my possessions she esteems not.
</DUKE>

<VALENTINE>	<50%>
	What would your Grace have me to do in this?
</VALENTINE>

<DUKE>	<50%>
	There is a lady of Verona here,
	Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy
	And nought esteems my aged eloquence:
	Now therefore, would I have thee to my tutor,
	For long agone I have forgot to court;
	Besides, the fashion of the time is chang'd,
	How and which way I may bestow myself
	To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.
</DUKE>

<VALENTINE>	<50%>
	Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:
	Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
	More than quick words do move a woman's mind.
</VALENTINE>

<DUKE>	<51%>
	But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
</DUKE>

<VALENTINE>	<51%>
	A woman sometime scorns what best contents her.
	Send her another; never give her o'er,
	For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
	If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,
	But rather to beget more love in you;
	If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;
	For why the fools are mad if left alone.
	Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;
	For, 'get you gone,' she doth not mean, 'away!'
	Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;
	Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.
	That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,
	If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.
</VALENTINE>

<DUKE>	<51%>
	But she I mean is promis'd by her friends
	Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,
	And kept severely from resort of men,
	That no man hath access by day to her.
</DUKE>

<VALENTINE>	<51%>
	Why then, I would resort to her by night.
</VALENTINE>

<DUKE>	<51%>
	Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,
	That no man hath recourse to her by night.
</DUKE>

<VALENTINE>	<51%>
	What lets but one may enter at her window?
</VALENTINE>

<DUKE>	<52%>
	Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
	And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
	Without apparent hazard of his life.
</DUKE>

<VALENTINE>	<52%>
	Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,
	To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,
	Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,

	Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,

<VALENTINE>	<52%>
	When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.
</VALENTINE>

	What letter is this same? What's here?—To Silvia!
	And here an engine fit for my proceeding!
	I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.

	My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly;
	And slaves they are to me that send them flying
	O! could their master come and go as lightly,
	Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!
	My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them;
	While I, their king, that thither them importune,
	Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,
	Because myself do want my servants' fortune:
	I curse myself, for they are sent by me,
	That they should harbour where their lord would be.

	What's here?

	Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee

	'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
	Why, Phaethon,—for thou art Merops' son,—
	Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
	And with thy daring folly burn the world?
	Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?
	Go, basc intruder! overweening slave!
	Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,
	And think my patience, more than thy desert,
	Is privilege for thy departure hence.
	Thank me for this more than for all the favours
	Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.
	But if thou linger in my territories
	Longer than swiftest expedition
	Will give thee time to leave our royal court,
	By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love
	I ever borc my daughter or thyself.
	Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;
	But, as thou lov'st thy life, make speed from hence.

	What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
	What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
	Unless it be to think that she is by
	And feed upon the shadow of perfection.
	Except I be by Silvia in the night,
	There is no music in the nightingale;
	Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
	There is no day for me to look upon.
	She is my essence; and I leave to be,
	If I be not by her fair influence
	Foster'd, illumin'd, cherish'd, kept alive.
	I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
	Tarry I here, I but attend on death;
	But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.

	As if but now they waxed pale for woe:
	But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,
	Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,
	Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;
	But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die.
	Besides, her intercession chaf'd him so,
	When she for thy repeal was suppliant,
	That to close prison he commanded her,

	Forsworn my company and rail'd at me,
	That I am desperate of obtaining her.
</THURIO>

<DUKE>	<63%>
	This weak impress of love is as a figure
	Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat
	Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
	A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,
	And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Proteus.>
</STAGE DIR>
	How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman
</DUKE>
	According to our proclamation gone?
<PROTEUS>	<63%>
	Gone, my good lord.
</PROTEUS>

<DUKE>	<63%>
	My daughter takes his going grievously.
</DUKE>

<PROTEUS>	<63%>
	A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.
</PROTEUS>

<DUKE>	<64%>
	So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.
	Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee,—
	For thou hast shown some sign of good desert,—
	Makes me the better to confer with thee.
</DUKE>

<PROTEUS>	<64%>
	Longer than I prove loyal to your Grace
	Let me not live to look upon your Grace.
</PROTEUS>

<DUKE>	<64%>
	Thou know'st how willingly I would effect
	The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.
</DUKE>

<PROTEUS>	<64%>
	I do, my lord.
</PROTEUS>

<DUKE>	<64%>
	And also, I think, thou art not ignorant
	How she opposes her against my will.
</DUKE>

<PROTEUS>	<64%>
	She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.
</PROTEUS>

<DUKE>	<64%>
	Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
	What might we do to make the girl forget
	The love of Valentine, and love Sir Thurio?
</DUKE>

<PROTEUS>	<64%>
	The best way is to slander Valentine
	With falsehood, cowardice, and poor descent,
	Three things that women highly hold in hate.
</PROTEUS>

<DUKE>	<64%>
	Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.
</DUKE>

<PROTEUS>	<64%>
	Ay, if his enemy deliver it:
	Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
	By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.
</PROTEUS>

<DUKE>	<64%>
	Then you must undertake to slander him.
</DUKE>

<PROTEUS>	<65%>
	And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:
	'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,
	Especially against his very friend.
</PROTEUS>

<DUKE>	<65%>
	Where your good word cannot advantage him,
	Your slander never can endamage him:
	Therefore the office is indifferent,
	Being entreated to it by your friend.
</DUKE>

<PROTEUS>	<65%>
	You have prevail'd, my lord. If I can do it,
	By aught that I can speak in his dispraise,
	She shall not long continue love to him.
	But say this weed her love from Valentine,
	It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.
</PROTEUS>

<THURIO>	<65%>
	Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,
	Lest it should ravel and be good to none,
	You must provide to bottom it on me;
	Which must be done by praising me as much
	As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.
</THURIO>

<DUKE>	<65%>
	And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,
	Because we know, on Valentine's report,
	You are already Love's firm votary
	And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
	Upon this warrant shall you have access
	Where you with Silvia may confer at large;
	For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,
	And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you;
	Where you may temper her, by your persuasion
	To hate young Valentine and love my friend.
</DUKE>

<PROTEUS>	<66%>
	As much as I can do I will effect.
	But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;
	You must lay lime to tangle her desires
	By wailful sonnets, whose composed rimes
	Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
</PROTEUS>

<DUKE>	<66%>
	Ay,
	Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.
</DUKE>

<PROTEUS>	<66%>
	Say that upon the altar of her beauty
	You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart.
	Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears
	Moist it again, and frame some feeling line
	That may discover such integrity:
	For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,
	Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,
	Make tigers tame and huge leviathans
	Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
	After your dire-lamenting elegies,
	Visit by night your lady's chamber-window
	With some sweet consort: to their instruments
	Tune a deploring dump; the night's dead silence
	Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.
	This, or else nothing, will inherit her.
</PROTEUS>

<DUKE>	<67%>
	This discipline shows thou hast been in love.
</DUKE>

<THURIO>	<67%>
	And thy advice this night I'll put in practice.
	Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,
	Let us into the city presently
	To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.
	I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
	To give the onset to thy good advice.
</THURIO>

<DUKE>	<67%>
	About it, gentlemen!
</DUKE>

<PROTEUS>	<67%>
	We'll wait upon your grace till aftersupper,
	And afterward determine our proceedings.
</PROTEUS>

<DUKE>	<67%>
	Even now about it! I will pardon you.

<OUTLAW 3>	<68%>
	Ay, by my beard, will we, for he is a proper man.
</OUTLAW 3>

<VALENTINE>	<68%>
	Then know, that I have little wealth to lose.
	A man I am cross'd with adversity:
	My riches are these poor habiliments,

	You take the sum and substance that I have.
</VALENTINE>

<OUTLAW 2>	<68%>

	Some sixteen months; and longer might have stay'd

</VALENTINE>

<OUTLAW 2>	<68%>
	What! were you banish'd thence?
</OUTLAW 2>

<VALENTINE>	<68%>
	I was.

	For what offence?
</OUTLAW 2>

<VALENTINE>	<68%>
	For that which now torments me to rehearse.

	Without false vantage or base treachery.
</VALENTINE>

<OUTLAW 1>	<68%>
	Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.

	Nothing, but my fortune.

<OUTLAW 3>	<69%>
	Know then, that some of us are gentlemen,
	Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth

	And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,
	Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.
</OUTLAW 2>

<OUTLAW 1>	<69%>
	And I for such like petty crimes as these.
	But to the purpose; for we cite our faults,
	That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives;
	And, partly, seeing you are beautified
	With goodly shape, and by your own report
	A linguist, and a man of such perfection
	As we do in our quality much want—
</OUTLAW 1>

<OUTLAW 2>	<70%>
	Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,
	Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you.
	Are you content to be our general?
	To make a virtue of necessity

	What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?

<PROTEUS>	<71%>
	Already have I been false to Valentine,
	And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.
	Under the colour of commending him,
	I have access my own love to prefer:
	But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,
	To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
	When I protest true loyalty to her,
	She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;
	When to her beauty I commend my vows,
	She bids me think how I have been forsworn
	In breaking faith with Julia whom I lov'd:
	And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
	The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,
	Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,
	The more it grows, and fawneth on her still.
	But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,
	And give some evening music to her ear.

	Ay, gentle Thurio; for you know that love

	Ay; but I hope, sir, that you love not here.
</THURIO>

	Who is Silvia? what is she?
	That all our swains commend her?
	Holy, fair, and wise is she;
	The heaven such grace did lend her,
	That she might admired be.
	Is she kind as she is fair?
	For beauty lives with kindness:
	Love doth to her eyes repair,
	To help him of his blindness;
	And, being help'd, inhabits there.
	Then to Silvia let us sing,
	That Silvia is excelling;
	She excels each mortal thing
	Upon the dull earth dwelling;
	To her let us garlands bring.

	You would have them always play but one thing?

	Often resort unto this gentlewoman?

<SILVIA>	<77%>
	O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman—
	Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not—
	Valiant, wise, remorseful, well-accomplish'd.
	Thou art not ignorant what dear good will
	I bear unto the banish'd Valentine,
	Nor how my father would enforce me marry
	Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.
	Thyself hast lov'd; and I have heard thee say
	No grief did ever come so near thy heart
	As when thy lady and thy true love died,
	Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity.
	Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,
	To Mantua, where, I hear he makes abode;
	And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,
	I do desire thy worthy company,
	Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
	Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour,
	But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,
	And on the justice of my flying hence,
	To keep me from a most unholy match,
	Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.
	I do desire thee, even from a heart
	As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,
	To bear me company and go with me:
	If not, to hide what I have said to thee,
	That I may venture to depart alone.

	Madam, I pity much your grievances;
	Which since I know they virtuously are plac'd,

	When will you go?

<The Same.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Launce with his dog.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LAUNCE>	<79%>
	When a man's servant shall play the cur with him, look you, it goes hard; one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it. I have taught him, even as one would say precisely, 'Thus would I teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master, and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg. O! 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies. I would have, as one should say, one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been hanged for't: sure as I live, he had suffered for't: you shall judge. He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentleman-like dogs under the duke's table: he had not been there—bless the mark—a pissing-while, but all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says one; 'What cur is that?' says another; 'Whip him out,' says the third; 'Hang him up,' says the duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't; thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? Didst thou ever see me do such a trick?

</LAUNCE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Proteus, and Julia in boy's clothes.>
</STAGE DIR>
<PROTEUS>	<81%>
	Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well
	And will employ thee in some service presently.
</PROTEUS>

<JULIA>	<81%>
	In what you please: I will do what I can.
</JULIA>

<PROTEUS>	<81%>
	I hope thou wilt. <STAGE DIR>
<To Launce.>
</STAGE DIR> How now, you whoreson peasant!
	Where have you been these two days loitering?
</PROTEUS>

<LAUNCE>	<81%>
	Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.
</LAUNCE>

<PROTEUS>	<81%>
	And what says she to my little jewel?
</PROTEUS>

<LAUNCE>	<81%>
	Marry, she says, your dog was a cur, and tells you, currish thanks is good enough for such a present.
</LAUNCE>

<PROTEUS>	<81%>
	But she received my dog?
</PROTEUS>

<LAUNCE>	<81%>
	No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought him back again.
</LAUNCE>

<PROTEUS>	<81%>
	What! didst thou offer her this from me?
</PROTEUS>

<LAUNCE>	<81%>
	Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me by the hangman boys in the marketplace; and then I offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of yours, and therefore the gift the greater.
</LAUNCE>

<PROTEUS>	<81%>
	Go, get thee hence, and find my dog again,
	Or ne'er return again into my sight.
	Away, I say! Stay'st thou to vex me here?
	A slave that still an end turns me to shame.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Launce.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Sebastian, I have entertained thee
	Partly, that I have need of such a youth,
	That can with some discretion do my business,
	For't is no trusting to yond foolish lout;
	But chiefly for thy face and thy behaviour,
	Which, if my augury deceive me not,
	Witness good bringing up, fortune, and truth:
	Therefore, know thou, for this I entertain thee.
	Go presently, and take this ring with thee.
	Deliver it to Madam Silvia:
	She lov'd me well deliver'd it to me.
</PROTEUS>

<JULIA>	<82%>
	It seems, you lov'd not her, to leave her token.
	She's dead, belike?
</JULIA>

<PROTEUS>	<82%>
	Not so: I think, she lives.
</PROTEUS>

<JULIA>	<82%>
	Alas!
</JULIA>

<PROTEUS>	<82%>
	Why dost thou cry 'alas?'
</PROTEUS>

<JULIA>	<82%>
	I cannot choose
	But pity her.
</JULIA>

<PROTEUS>	<82%>
	Wherefore should'st thou pity her?
</PROTEUS>

<JULIA>	<82%>
	Because methinks that she lov'd you as well
	As you do love your lady Silvia.
	She dreams on him that has forgot her love;
	You dote on her, that cares not for your love.
	'Tis pity, love should be so contrary;
	And thinking on it makes me cry, 'alas!'
</JULIA>

<PROTEUS>	<83%>
	Well, well, give her that ring and therewithal
	This letter: that's her chamber. Tell my lady
	I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.
	Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,
	Where thou shalt find me sad and solitary.
</PROTEUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<JULIA>	<83%>
	How many women would do such a message?
	Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd
	A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
	Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him
	That with his very heart despiseth me?
	Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
	Because I love him, I must pity him.
	This ring I gave him when he parted from me,
	To bind him to remember my good will;
	And now am I—unhappy messenger—
	To plead for that which I would not obtain,
	To carry that which I would have refus'd,
	To praise his faith which I would have disprais'd.
	I am my master's true-confirmed love,
	But cannot be true servant to my master,
	Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
	Yet will I woo for him; but yet so coldly
	As heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Silvia, attended.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean
</JULIA>
	To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.
<SILVIA>	<84%>
	What would you with her, if that I be she?
</SILVIA>

<JULIA>	<84%>
	If you be she, I do entreat your patience To hear me speak the message I am sent on.
</JULIA>

<SILVIA>	<84%>
	From whom?
</SILVIA>

<JULIA>	<84%>
	From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.
</JULIA>

<SILVIA>	<84%>
	O! he sends you for a picture?
</SILVIA>

<JULIA>	<84%>
	Ay, madam.
</JULIA>

<SILVIA>	<84%>
	Ursula, bring my picture there.
<STAGE DIR>
<A picture brought.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Go, give your master this: tell him from me,
	One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
	Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.
</SILVIA>

<JULIA>	<84%>
	Madam, please you peruse this letter.—
	Pardon me, madam, I have unadvis'd
	Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:
	This is the letter to your ladyship.
</JULIA>

<SILVIA>	<84%>
	I pray thee, let me look on that again.
</SILVIA>

<JULIA>	<84%>
	It may not be: good madam, pardon me.
</JULIA>

<SILVIA>	<84%>
	There, hold.
	I will not look upon your master's lines:
	I know, they are stuff'd with protestations
	And full of new-found oaths, which he will break
	As easily as I do tear his paper.
</SILVIA>

<JULIA>	<85%>
	Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.
</JULIA>

<SILVIA>	<85%>
	The more shame for him that he sends it me;
	For, I have heard him say a thousand times,
	His Julia gave it him at his departure.
	Though his false finger have profan'd the ring,
	Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.
</SILVIA>

<JULIA>	<85%>
	She thanks you.
</JULIA>

<SILVIA>	<85%>
	What say'st thou?
</SILVIA>

<JULIA>	<85%>
	I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
	Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.
</JULIA>

<SILVIA>	<85%>
	Dost thou know her?
</SILVIA>

<JULIA>	<85%>
	Almost as well as I do know myself:
	To think upon her woes, I do protest
	That I have wept a hundred several times.
</JULIA>

<SILVIA>	<85%>
	Belike, she thinks, that Proteus hath forsook her.
</SILVIA>

<JULIA>	<85%>
	I think she doth, and that's her cause of sorrow.
</JULIA>

<SILVIA>	<85%>
	Is she not passing fair?
</SILVIA>

<JULIA>	<85%>
	She hath been fairer, madam, than she is.
	When she did think my master lov'd her well,
	She, in my judgment, was as fair as you;
	But since she did neglect her looking-glass
	And threw her sun-expelling mask away,
	The air hath starv'd the roses in her cheeks
	And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,
	That now she is become as black as I.
</JULIA>

<SILVIA>	<86%>
	How tall was she?
</SILVIA>

<JULIA>	<86%>
	About my stature; for, at Pentecost,
	When all our pageants of delight were play'd,
	Our youth got me to play the woman's part,
	And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,
	Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,
	As if the garment had been made for me:
	Therefore I know she is about my height.
	And at that time I made her weep agood;
	For I did play a lamentable part.
	Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning
	For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;
	Which I so lively acted with my tears
	That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,
	Wept bitterly, and would I might be dead
	If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!
</JULIA>

<SILVIA>	<86%>
	She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.—
	Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
	I weep myself to think upon thy words.
	Here, youth, there is my purse: I give thee this
	For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lov'st her.
	Farewell.
</SILVIA>

<JULIA>	<87%>
	And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.—
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Silvia, with Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
	A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful.
	I hope my master's suit will be but cold,
	Since she respects my mistress' love so much.
	Alas, how love can trifle with itself!
	Here is her picture: let me see; I think,
	If I had such a tire, this face of mine
	Were full as lovely as is this of hers;
	And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,
	Unless I flatter with myself too much.
	Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:
	If that be all the difference in his love
	I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.
	Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:
	Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.
	What should it be that he respects in her
	But I can make respective in myself,
	If this fond Love were not a blinded god?
	Come, shadow, come, and take this shadow up,
	For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form!
	Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, lov'd, and ador'd,
	And, were there sense in his idolatry,
	My substance should be statue in thy stead.
	I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,
	That us'd me so; or else, by Jove I vow,
	I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes,
	To make my master out of love with thee.

	O, sir, I find her milder than she was;

</PROTEUS>

<THURIO>	<89%>
	What! that my leg is too long?
</THURIO>

<PROTEUS>	<89%>
	No, that it is too little.

	She says it is a fair one.
</PROTEUS>

<THURIO>	<89%>
	Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.

<DUKE>	<90%>
	Why then,
	She's fled unto that peasant Valentine,
	And Eglamour is in her company.
	'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,
	As he in penance wander'd through the forest;
	Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,
	But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it;
	Besides, she did intend confession
	At Patrick's cell this even, and there she was not.
	These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
	Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,
	But mount you presently and meet with me

	Thou friend of an ill fashion!
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<95%>
	Valentine!
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<95%>
	Thou common friend, that's without faith or love—
	For such is a friend now—treach'rous man!
	Thou hast beguil'd my hopes: naught but mine eye
	Could have persuaded me. Now I dare not say
	I have one friend alive: thou wouldst disprove me.
	Who should be trusted now, when one's right hand
	Is perjur'd to the bosom? Proteus,
	I am sorry I must never trust thee more,
	But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
	The private wound is deep'st. O time most curst!
	'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<96%>
	My shame and guilt confound me.
	Forgive me, Valentine. If hearty sorrow
	Be a sufficient ransom for offence,
	I tender't here: I do as truly suffer
	As e'er I did commit.
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<96%>
	Then, I am paid;
	And once again I do receive thee honest.
	Who by repentance is not satisfied
	Is nor of heaven, nor earth; for these are pleas'd.
	By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeas'd:
	And, that my love may appear plain and free,
	All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.
</VALENTINE>

<JULIA>	<96%>
	O me unhappy!
</JULIA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Swoons.>
</STAGE DIR>

<PROTEUS>	<96%>
	Look to the boy.
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<96%>
	Why, boy! why, wag! how now! what's the matter?
	Look up; speak.
</VALENTINE>

<JULIA>	<96%>
	O good sir, my master charg'd me
	To deliver a ring to Madam Silvia,
	Which out of my neglect was never done.
</JULIA>

<PROTEUS>	<96%>
	Where is that ring, boy?
</PROTEUS>

<JULIA>	<96%>
	Here 'tis this is it.
</JULIA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Gives a ring.>
</STAGE DIR>

<PROTEUS>	<96%>
	How! let me see.
	Why this is the ring I gave to Julia.
</PROTEUS>

<JULIA>	<96%>
	O, cry you mercy, sir; I have mistook:
	This is the ring you sent to Silvia.
</JULIA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Shows another ring.>
</STAGE DIR>

<PROTEUS>	<97%>
	But how cam'st thou by this ring?
	At my depart I gave this unto Julia.
</PROTEUS>

<JULIA>	<97%>
	And Julia herself did give it me;
	And Julia herself hath brought it hither.
</JULIA>

<PROTEUS>	<97%>
	How! Julia!
</PROTEUS>

<JULIA>	<97%>
	Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
	And entertain'd them deeply in her heart:
	How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
	O Proteus! let this habit make thee blush.
	Be thou asham'd that I have took upon me
	Such an immodest raiment; if shame live
	In a disguise of love.
	It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
	Women to change their shapes than men their minds.
</JULIA>

<PROTEUS>	<97%>
	Than men their minds! 'tis true. O heaven! were man
	But constant, he were perfect: that one error
	Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:
	Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
	What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy
	More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?
</PROTEUS>

<VALENTINE>	<97%>
	Come, come, a hand from either.
	Let me be blest to make this happy close:
	'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.
</VALENTINE>

<PROTEUS>	<98%>
	Bear witness, heaven, I have my wish, for ever.
</PROTEUS>

<JULIA>	<98%>
	And I mine.

<Enter Outlaws with Duke and Thurio.>
</STAGE DIR>
<OUTLAW>	<98%>
	A prize! a prize! a prize!
</OUTLAW>

<VALENTINE>	<98%>
	Forbear, forbear, I say; it is my lord the duke.
	Your Grace is welcome to a man disgrac'd,
	Banished Valentine.
</VALENTINE>

<DUKE>	<98%>
	Sir Valentine!
</DUKE>

<THURIO>	<98%>
	Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.
</THURIO>

<VALENTINE>	<98%>
	Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;
	Come not within the measure of my wrath;
	Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,
	Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
	Take but possession of her with a touch;
	I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.
</VALENTINE>

<THURIO>	<98%>
	Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I.
	I hold him but a fool that will endanger
	His body for a girl that loves him not:
	I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.
</THURIO>

<DUKE>	<98%>
	The more degenerate and base art thou,
	To make such means for her as thou hast done,
	And leave her on such slight conditions.
	Now, by the honour of my ancestry,
	I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,
	And think thee worthy of an empress' love.
	Know then, I here forget all former griefs,
	Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
	Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,
	To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,
	Thou art a gentleman and well deriv'd;
	Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserv'd her.
</DUKE>

<VALENTINE>	<99%>
	I thank your Grace; the gift hath made me happy.
	I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,
	To grant one boon that I shall ask of you.
</VALENTINE>

<DUKE>	<99%>
	I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.
</DUKE>

<VALENTINE>	<99%>
	These banish'd men, that I have kept withal
	Are men endu'd with worthy qualities:
	Forgive them what they have committed here,
	And let them be recall'd from their exile.
	They are reformed, civil, full of good,
	And fit for great employment, worthy lord.
</VALENTINE>

<DUKE>	<99%>
	Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them, and thee:
	Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.
	Come, let us go: we will include all jars
	With triumphs, mirth, and rare solemnity.
</DUKE>

<VALENTINE>	<99%>
	And as we walk along, I dare be bold
	With our discourse to make your Grace to smile.
	What think you of this page, my lord?
</VALENTINE>

<DUKE>	<100%>
	I think the boy hath grace in him: he blushes.
</DUKE>

<VALENTINE>	<100%>
	I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.
</VALENTINE>

<DUKE>	<100%>
	What mean you by that saying?
</DUKE>

<VALENTINE>	<100%>
	Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,
	That you will wonder what hath fortuned.
	Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance, but to hear
	The story of your loves discovered:
	That done, our day of marriage shall be yours;
	One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.
