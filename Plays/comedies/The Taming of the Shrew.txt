<INDUCTION.>


<SCENE 1>
<Before an Alehouse on a Heath.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Hostess and Sly.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SLY>	<0%>
	I'll pheeze you, in faith.
</SLY>

<HOSTESS>	<0%>
	A pair of stocks, you rogue!
</HOSTESS>

<SLY>	<0%>
	Y'are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror. Therefore, paucas pallabris; let the world slide. Sessa!
</SLY>

<HOSTESS>	<1%>
	You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?
</HOSTESS>

<SLY>	<1%>
	No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy, go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.
</SLY>

<HOSTESS>	<1%>
	I know my remedy: I must go fetch the third-borough.
</HOSTESS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<SLY>	<1%>
	Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him by law. I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come, and kindly.
<STAGE DIR>
<Lies down on the ground, and falls asleep.>
</STAGE DIR>

</SLY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with Huntsman and Servants.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LORD>	<1%>
	Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:
	Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd,
	And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth'd brach.
	Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
	At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?
	I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
</LORD>

<HUNTSMAN 1>	<1%>
	Why, Bellman is as good as he, my lord;
	He cried upon it at the merest loss,
	And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:
	Trust me, I take him for the better dog.
</HUNTSMAN 1>

<LORD>	<1%>
	Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
	I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
	But sup them well, and look unto them all:
	To-morrow I intend to hunt again.
</LORD>

<HUNTSMAN 1>	<2%>
	I will, my lord.
</HUNTSMAN 1>

<LORD>	<2%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Sees Sly.>
</STAGE DIR> What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?
</LORD>

<HUNTSMAN 2>	<2%>
	He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
	This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.
</HUNTSMAN 2>

<LORD>	<2%>
	O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!
	Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
	Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
	What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,
	Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
	A most delicious banquet by his bed,
	And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
	Would not the beggar then forget himself?
</LORD>

<HUNTSMAN 1>	<2%>
	Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
</HUNTSMAN 1>

<HUNTSMAN 2>	<2%>
	It would seem strange unto him when he wak'd.
</HUNTSMAN 2>

<LORD>	<2%>
	Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.
	Then take him up and manage well the jest.
	Carry him gently to my fairest chamber,
	And hang it round with all my wanton pictures;
	Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters,
	And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet.
	Procure me music ready when he wakes,
	To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
	And if he chance to speak, be ready straight,
	And with a low submissive reverence
	Say, 'What is it your honour will command?'
	Let one attend him with a silver basin
	Full of rose-water, and bestrew'd with flowers;
	Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
	And say, 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
	Some one be ready with a costly suit,
	And ask him what apparel he will wear;
	Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
	And that his lady mourns at his disease.
	Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;
	And, when he says he is—say that he dreams,
	For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
	This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs:
	It will be pastime passing excellent,
	If it be husbanded with modesty.
</LORD>

<HUNTSMAN 1>	<3%>
	My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,
	As he shall think, by our true diligence,
	He is no less than what we say he is.
</HUNTSMAN 1>

<LORD>	<3%>
	Take him up gently, and to bed with him,
	And each one to his office when he wakes.
<STAGE DIR>
<Sly is borne out. A trumpet sounds.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Servant.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Belike, some noble gentleman that means,
	Travelling some journey, to repose him here.

</LORD>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Servant.>
</STAGE DIR>
	How now! who is it?
<SERVANT>	<3%>
	An it please your honour,
	Players that offer service to your lordship.
</SERVANT>

<LORD>	<3%>
	Bid them come near.

</LORD>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Players.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Now, fellows, you are welcome.
<PLAYERS>	<4%>
	We thank your honour.
</PLAYERS>

<LORD>	<4%>
	Do you intend to stay with me to-night?
</LORD>

<PLAYER>	<4%>
	So please your lordship to accept our duty.
</PLAYER>

<LORD>	<4%>
	With all my heart. This fellow I remember,
	Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:
	'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well.
	I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
	Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.
</LORD>

<PLAYER>	<4%>
	I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.
</PLAYER>

<LORD>	<4%>
	'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.
	Well, you are come to me in happy time,
	The rather for I have some sport in hand
	Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
	There is a lord will hear you play to-night;
	But I am doubtful of your modesties,
	Lest, over-eyeing of his odd behaviour,—
	For yet his honour never heard a play,—
	You break into some merry passion
	And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
	If you should smile he grows impatient.
</LORD>

<PLAYER>	<4%>
	Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves
	Were he the veriest antick in the world.
</PLAYER>

<LORD>	<4%>
	Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
	And give them friendly welcome every one:
	Let them want nothing that my house affords.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt one with the Players.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,
	And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:
	That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;
	And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
	Tell him from me,—as he will win my love,—
	He bear himself with honourable action,
	Such as he hath observ'd in noble ladies
	Unto their lords, by them accomplished:
	Such duty to the drunkard let him do
	With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy;
	And say, 'What is't your honour will command,
	Wherein your lady and your humble wife
	May show her duty, and make known her love?'
	And then, with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
	And with declining head into his bosom,
	Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd
	To see her noble lord restor'd to health,
	Who for this seven years hath esteemed him
	No better than a poor and loathsome beggar.
	And if the boy have not a woman's gift
	To rain a shower of commanded tears,
	An onion will do well for such a shift,
	Which in a napkin being close convey'd,
	Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
	See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:
	Anon I'll give thee more instructions.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Servant.>
</STAGE DIR>
	I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
	Voice, gait, and action of a gentlewoman:
	I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,
	And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
	When they do homage to this simple peasant.
	I'll in to counsel them: haply, my presence
	May well abate the over merry spleen
	Which otherwise would grow into extremes.

	For God's sake! a pot of small ale.

<SERVANT 1>	<6%>
	Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?

<SERVANT 2>	<6%>
	Will't please your honour taste of these conserves?
</SERVANT 2>

<SERVANT 3>	<6%>
	What raiment will your honour wear to-day?
</SERVANT 3>

<SLY>	<6%>
	I am Christophero Sly; call not me honour, nor lordship: I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if you give me any conserves, give me conserves of beef. Ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear, for I have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings than legs, nor no more shoes than feet: nay, sometime more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my toes look through the overleather.
</SLY>

<LORD>	<6%>
	Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
	O, that a mighty man, of such descent,
	Of such possessions, and so high esteem,
	Should be infused with so foul a spirit!
</LORD>

<SLY>	<6%>
	What! would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher Sly, old Sly's son, of Burtonheath; by birth a pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker? Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not bestraught: here's—
</SLY>

<SERVANT 1>	<7%>
	O! this it is that makes your lady mourn.
</SERVANT 1>

<SERVANT 2>	<7%>
	O! this it is that makes your servants droop.
</SERVANT 2>

<LORD>	<7%>
	Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
	As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
	O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,
	Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment,
	And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
	Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
	Each in his office ready at thy beck:
	Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,
<STAGE DIR>
<Music.>
</STAGE DIR>
	And twenty caged nightingales do sing:
	Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch
	Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
	On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.
	Say thou wilt walk, we will bestrew the ground:
	Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,
	Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
	Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar
	Above the morning lark: or wilt thou hunt?
	Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them,
	And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.
</LORD>

<SERVANT 1>	<8%>
	Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
	As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.
</SERVANT 1>

<SERVANT 2>	<8%>
	Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight
	Adonis painted by a running brook,
	And Cytherea all in sedges hid,
	Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,
	Even as the waving sedges play with wind.
</SERVANT 2>

<LORD>	<8%>
	We'll show thee Io as she was a maid,
	And how she was beguiled and surpris'd,
	As lively painted as the deed was done.
</LORD>

<SERVANT 3>	<8%>
	Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
	Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds;
	And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
	So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
</SERVANT 3>

<LORD>	<8%>
	Thou art a lord and nothing but a lord:
	Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
	Than any woman in this waning age.
</LORD>

<SERVANT 1>	<8%>
	And till the tears that she hath shed for thee
	Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
	She was the fairest creature in the world;
	And yet she is inferior to none.
</SERVANT 1>

<SLY>	<8%>
	Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?
	Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?
	I do not sleep; I see, I hear, I speak;
	I smell sweet savours, and I feel soft things:
	Upon my life, I am a lord indeed;
	And not a tinker, nor Christophero Sly.
	Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;
	And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.
</SLY>

<SERVANT 2>	<9%>
	Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands?
<STAGE DIR>
<Servants present a ewer, basin, and napkin.>
</STAGE DIR>
	O, how we joy to see your wit restor'd!
	O, that once more you knew but what you are!
	These fifteen years you have been in a dream,
	Or, when you wak'd, so wak'd as if you slept.
</SERVANT 2>

<SLY>	<9%>
	These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.
	But did I never speak of all that time?
</SLY>

<SERVANT 1>	<9%>
	O! yes, my lord, but very idle words;
	For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
	Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door,
	And rail upon the hostess of the house,
	And say you would present her at the leet,
	Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts.
	Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.
</SERVANT 1>

<SLY>	<9%>
	Ay, the woman's maid of the house.
</SLY>

<SERVANT 3>	<9%>
	Why, sir, you know no house, nor no such maid,
	Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,
	As Stephen Sly, and old John Naps of Greece,
	And Peter Turf, and Henry Pimpernell,
	And twenty more such names and men as these,
	Which never were nor no man ever saw.
</SERVANT 3>

<SLY>	<9%>
	Now, Lord be thanked for my good amends!
</SLY>

<ALL>	<9%>
	Amen.

	Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her?

	Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
	Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.

	'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.
	Madam, undress you, and come now to bed.
</SLY>

<PAGE>	<10%>
	Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you
	To pardon me yet for a night or two,
	Or, if not so, until the sun be set:
	For your physicians have expressly charg'd,
	In peril to incur your former malady,
	That I should yet absent me from your bed:
	I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
</PAGE>

<SLY>	<10%>
	Ay, it stands so, that I may hardly tarry so long; but I would be loath to fall into my dreams again: I will therefore tarry, in spite of the flesh and the blood.

	Your honour's players, hearing your amendment,
	Are come to play a pleasant comedy;
	For so your doctors hold it very meet,
	Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,
	And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:
	Therefore they thought it good you hear a play,
	And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,
	Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.
</SERVANT>

<SLY>	<11%>
	Marry, I will; let them play it. Is not a commonty a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?
</SLY>

</SLY>
<SCENE 1>
<Padua. A public Place.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Lucentio and Tranio.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LUCENTIO>	<11%>
	Tranio, since for the great desire I had
	To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
	I am arriv'd for fruitful Lombardy,
	The pleasant garden of great Italy;
	And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
	With his good will and thy good company,
	My trusty servant well approv'd in all,
	Here let us breathe, and haply institute
	A course of learning and ingenious studies.
	Pisa, renowned for grave citizens,
	Gave me my being and my father first,
	A merchant of great traffic through the world,
	Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii.
	Vincentio's son, brought up in Florence,
	It shall become to serve all hopes conceiv'd,
	To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:
	And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
	Virtue and that part of philosophy
	Will I apply that treats of happiness
	By virtue specially to be achiev'd.
	Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
	And am to Padua come, as he that leaves
	A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,
	And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.
</LUCENTIO>

<TRANIO>	<12%>
	Mi perdonate, gentle master mine,
	I am in all affected as yourself,
	Glad that you thus continue your resolve
	To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
	Only, good master, while we do admire
	This virtue and this moral discipline,
	Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
	Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
	As Ovid be an outcast quite abjur'd.
	Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,
	And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
	Music and poesy use to quicken you;
	The mathematics and the metaphysics,
	Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;
	No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en;
	In brief, sir, study what you most affect.
</TRANIO>

<LUCENTIO>	<13%>
	Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
	If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,
	We could at once put us in readiness,
	And take a lodging fit to entertain
	Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
	But stay awhile: what company is this?
</LUCENTIO>

<TRANIO>	<13%>
	Master, some show to welcome us to town.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Baptista, Katharina, Blanca, Gremio, and Hortensio. Lucentio and Tranio stand aside.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BAPTISTA>	<13%>
	Gentlemen, importune me no further,
	For how I firmly am resolv'd you know;
	That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter
	Before I have a husband for the elder.
	If either of you both love Katharina,
	Because I know you well and love you well,
	Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.
</BAPTISTA>

<GREMIO>	<13%>

<To Baptista.>
</STAGE DIR> I pray you, sir, is it your will

	Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,
	Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
</HORTENSIO>

<KATHARINA>	<13%>
	I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:
	I wis it is not half way to her heart;
	But if it were, doubt not her care should be
	To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool,
	And paint your face, and use you like a fool.
</KATHARINA>

<HORTENSIO>	<14%>
	From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!
</HORTENSIO>

<GREMIO>	<14%>
	And me too, good Lord!

	Hush, master! here is some good pastime toward:

	But in the other's silence do I see
	Maid's mild behaviour and sobriety.

	Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.
</TRANIO>

<BAPTISTA>	<14%>
	Gentlemen, that I may soon make good
	What I have said,—Bianca, get you in:
	And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
	For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.

	Sister, content you in my discontent.
	Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:
	My books and instruments shall be my company,

<GREMIO>	<14%>
	Why will you mew her up,
	Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
	And make her bear the penance of her tongue?

<BAPTISTA>	<14%>
	Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolv'd.
	Go in, Bianca.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Bianca.>
</STAGE DIR>
	And for I know she taketh most delight
	In music, instruments, and poetry,
	Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,
	Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
	Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
	Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
	I will be very kind, and liberal
	To mine own children in good bringing up;
	And so, farewell. Katharina, you may stay;
	For I have more to commune with Bianca.
</BAPTISTA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<KATHARINA>	<15%>

	You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together, and fast it fairly out: our cake's dough on both sides. Farewell: yet, for the love I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to her father.

	So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray. Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,—that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianca's love,—to labour and effect one thing specially.

<LUCENTIO>	<17%>
	O Tranio! till I found it to be true,
	I never thought it possible or likely;
	But see, while idly I stood looking on,
	I found the effect of love in idleness;
	And now in plainness do confess to thee,
	That art to me as secret and as dear
	As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was,
	Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
	If I achieve not this young modest girl.
	Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst:
	Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.
</LUCENTIO>

<TRANIO>	<17%>
	Master, it is no time to chide you now;
	Affection is not rated from the heart:
	If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,
	Redime te captum, quam queas minimo.

<LUCENTIO>	<17%>
	Gramercies, lad; go forward: this contents:

	Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,
	Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.
</TRANIO>

<LUCENTIO>	<17%>
	O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
	Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
	That made great Jove to humble him to her hand,
	When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.
</LUCENTIO>

<TRANIO>	<17%>
	Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister
	Began to scold and raise up such a storm
	That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?

<LUCENTIO>	<17%>
	Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move,

</LUCENTIO>

<TRANIO>	<18%>
	Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
	I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,
	Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
	Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd,
	That till the father rid his hands of her,
	Master, your love must live a maid at home;
	And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
	Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.
</TRANIO>

<LUCENTIO>	<18%>
	Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
	But art thou not advis'd he took some care
	To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
</LUCENTIO>

<TRANIO>	<18%>
	Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.

<LUCENTIO>	<18%>

<LUCENTIO>	<18%>

<TRANIO>	<18%>

	That's your device.
</TRANIO>

<LUCENTIO>	<18%>
	It is: may it be done?
</LUCENTIO>

<TRANIO>	<18%>
	Not possible; for who shall bear your part,

	Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends;
	Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?

<LUCENTIO>	<18%>
	Basta; content thee; for I have it full.
	We have not yet been seen in any house,
	Nor can we be distinguish'd by our faces
	For man, or master: then, it follows thus:
	Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
	Keep house, and port, and servants, as I should:
	I will some other be; some Florentine,
	Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
	'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once
	Uncase thee, take my colour'd hat and cloak:
	When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
	But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.

	'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,
	Although I think 'twas in another sense:
	I am content to be Lucentio,
	Because so well I love Lucentio.
</TRANIO>

<LUCENTIO>	<19%>
	Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves;

	Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.

<LUCENTIO>	<19%>
	Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,
	And therefore frame your manners to the time.
	Your fellow Tranio, here, to save my life,
	Puts my apparel and my countenance on,
	And I for my escape have put on his;
	For in a quarrel since I came ashore
	I kill'd a man, and fear I was descried.
	Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,

	When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
	But in all places else your master, Lucentio.

<GRUMIO>	<22%>
	Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin. If this be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to use his master so; being, perhaps, for aught I see, two-and-thirty, a pip out?
	Whom would to God, I had well knock'd at first,
	Then had not Grumio come by the worst.
</GRUMIO>

<PETRUCHIO>	<22%>
	A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
	I bade the rascal knock upon your gate,
	And could not get him for my heart to do it.

<GRUMIO>	<22%>
	Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and knock me soundly?' And come you now with 'knocking at the gate?'

<PETRUCHIO>	<22%>
	Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.
</PETRUCHIO>

	Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge.
	Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
	Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
	And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
	Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
</HORTENSIO>

<PETRUCHIO>	<22%>
	Such wind as scatters young men through the world
	To seek their fortunes further than at home,
	Where small experience grows. But in a few,
	Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
	Antonio, my father, is deceas'd,
	And I have thrust myself into this maze,
	Haply to wive and thrive as best I may.
	Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
	And so am come abroad to see the world.
</PETRUCHIO>

<HORTENSIO>	<23%>
	Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee,
	And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
	Thou'dst thank me but a little for my counsel;
	And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich,
	And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,
	And I'll not wish thee to her.
</HORTENSIO>

<PETRUCHIO>	<23%>
	Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we,
	Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
	One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
	As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
	Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
	As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd
	As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,
	She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
	Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
	As are the swelling Adriatic seas:
	I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
	If wealthily, then happily in Padua.
</PETRUCHIO>

<GRUMIO>	<23%>
	Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is: why, give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases as two-and-fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal.
</GRUMIO>

<HORTENSIO>	<23%>
	Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
	I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
	I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
	With wealth enough, and young and beauteous,
	Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:
	Her only fault,—and that is faults enough,—
	Is, that she is intolerable curst
	And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure,
	That, were my state far worser than it is,
	I would not wed her for a mine of gold:
</HORTENSIO>

<PETRUCHIO>	<24%>
	Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:
	Tell me her father's name, and 'tis enough;
	For I will board her, though she chide as loud
	As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
</PETRUCHIO>

<HORTENSIO>	<24%>
	Her father is Baptista Minola,
	An affable and courteous gentleman;
	Her name is Katharina Minola,
	Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.
</HORTENSIO>

<PETRUCHIO>	<24%>
	I know her father, though I know not her;
	And he knew my deceased father well.
	I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
	And therefore let me be thus bold with you,
	To give you over at this first encounter,
	Unless you will accompany me thither.
</PETRUCHIO>

<GRUMIO>	<24%>
	I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding would do little good upon him. She may, perhaps, call him half a score knaves or so: why, that's nothing: an he begin once, he'll rail in his ropetricks. I'll tell you what, sir, an she stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in her face, and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.
</GRUMIO>

<HORTENSIO>	<25%>
	Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,
	For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:
	He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
	His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca,
	And her withholds from me and other more,
	Suitors to her and rivals in my love;
	Supposing it a thing impossible,
	For those defects I have before rehears'd,
	That ever Katharina will be woo'd:
	Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
	That none shall have access unto Bianca,
	Till Katharine the curst have got a husband.
</HORTENSIO>

<GRUMIO>	<25%>
	Katharine the curst!
	A title for a maid of all titles the worst.

	Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
	And offer me, disguis'd in sober robes,

	Have leave and leisure to make love to her,

	You understand me. Over and beside
	Signior Baptista's liberality,
	I'll mend it with a largess. Take your papers too,

<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Well begun, Tranio.
</LUCENTIO>

<HORTENSIO>	<29%>
	Sir, a word ere you go:
	Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?
</HORTENSIO>

<TRANIO>	<29%>
	And if I be, sir, is it any offence?
</TRANIO>

<GREMIO>	<29%>
	No; if without more words you will get you hence.
</GREMIO>

<TRANIO>	<29%>
	Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
	For me as for you?
</TRANIO>

<GREMIO>	<29%>
	But so is not she.
</GREMIO>

<TRANIO>	<29%>
	For what reason, I beseech you?
</TRANIO>

<GREMIO>	<29%>
	For this reason, if you'll know,
	That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.
</GREMIO>

<HORTENSIO>	<29%>
	That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
</HORTENSIO>

<TRANIO>	<29%>
	Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,
	Do me this right; hear me with patience.
	Baptista is a noble gentleman,
	To whom my father is not all unknown;
	And were his daughter fairer than she is,
	She may more suitors have, and me for one.
	Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
	Then well one more may fair Bianca have,
	And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,
	Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.
</TRANIO>

<GREMIO>	<29%>
	What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.
</GREMIO>

<LUCENTIO>	<30%>
	Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade.
</LUCENTIO>

<PETRUCHIO>	<30%>
	Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
</PETRUCHIO>

<HORTENSIO>	<30%>
	Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
	Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?
</HORTENSIO>

<TRANIO>	<30%>
	No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,
	The one as famous for a scolding tongue
	As is the other for beauteous modesty.
</TRANIO>

<PETRUCHIO>	<30%>
	Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.
</PETRUCHIO>

<GREMIO>	<30%>
	Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules,
	And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
</GREMIO>

<PETRUCHIO>	<30%>
	Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:
	The youngest daughter, whom you hearken for,
	Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
	And will not promise her to any man
	Until the elder sister first be wed;
	The younger then is free, and not before.
</PETRUCHIO>

<TRANIO>	<30%>
	If it be so, sir, that you are the man
	Must stead us all, and me among the rest;
	And if you break the ice, and do this feat,
	Achieve the elder, set the younger free
	For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
	Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.
</TRANIO>

<HORTENSIO>	<30%>
	Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive;
	And since you do profess to be a suitor,
	You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
	To whom we all rest generally beholding.
</HORTENSIO>

<TRANIO>	<30%>
	Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,
	Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
	And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,
	And do as adversaries do in law,
	Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.
</TRANIO>

<GRUMIO>	<31%>
	O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.

<BIONDELLO>	<31%>
	O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.

</STAGE DIR>
<BIANCA>	<31%>
	Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
	To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;
	That I disdain: but for these other gawds,

	Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell

	Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
	I never yet beheld that special face

<KATHARINA>	<31%>
	Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?
</KATHARINA>

<BIANCA>	<31%>
	If you affect him, sister, here I swear
	I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have him.
</BIANCA>

<KATHARINA>	<31%>
	O! then, belike, you fancy riches more:
	You will have Gremio to keep you fair.
</KATHARINA>

<BIANCA>	<31%>
	Is it for him you do envy me so?
	Nay, then you jest; and now I well perceive
	You have but jested with me all this while:
	I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.

	Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
	For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit,
	Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
	When did she cross thee with a bitter word?
</BAPTISTA>

<KATHARINA>	<32%>
	Her silence flouts me, and I'll be reveng'd.

	What! will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see

<PETRUCHIO>	<33%>
	And you, good sir. Pray, have you not a daughter

</PETRUCHIO>

<BAPTISTA>	<33%>
	I have a daughter, sir, call'd Katharina.
</BAPTISTA>

<GREMIO>	<33%>
	You are too blunt: go to it orderly.
</GREMIO>

<PETRUCHIO>	<33%>
	You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.
	I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
	That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
	Her affability and bashful modesty,
	Her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour,
	Am bold to show myself a forward guest
	Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
	Of that report which I so oft have heard.
	And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
	I do present you with a man of mine,
<STAGE DIR>
<Presenting Hortensio.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Cunning in music and the mathematics,
	To instruct her fully in those sciences,
	Whereof I know she is not ignorant.
	Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:
	His name is Licio, born in Mantua.
</PETRUCHIO>

<BAPTISTA>	<33%>
	You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.
	But for my daughter Katharine, this I know,
	She is not for your turn, the more my grief.
</BAPTISTA>

<PETRUCHIO>	<33%>
	I see you do not mean to part with her,
	Or else you like not of my company.
</PETRUCHIO>

<BAPTISTA>	<34%>
	Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
	Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?
</BAPTISTA>

<PETRUCHIO>	<34%>
	Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son;
	A man well known throughout all Italy.
</PETRUCHIO>

<BAPTISTA>	<34%>
	I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.
</BAPTISTA>

<GREMIO>	<34%>
	Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
	Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too.
	Backare! you are marvellous forward.
</GREMIO>

<PETRUCHIO>	<34%>
	O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.
</PETRUCHIO>

<GREMIO>	<34%>
	I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your wooing.
	Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it. To express the like kindness myself, that have been more kindly beholding to you than any, freely give unto you this young scholar, <STAGE DIR>
<Presenting Lucentio.>
</STAGE DIR> that has been long studying at Rheims; as cunning in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other in music and mathematics. His name is Cambio; pray accept his service.
</GREMIO>

<BAPTISTA>	<34%>
	A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio; welcome, good Cambio.—<STAGE DIR>
<To Tranio.>
</STAGE DIR> But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger: may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?
</BAPTISTA>

<TRANIO>	<34%>
	Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
	That, being a stranger in this city here,
	Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
	Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
	Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
	In the preferment of the eldest sister.
	This liberty is all that I request,
	That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
	I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo,
	And free access and favour as the rest:
	And, toward the education of your daughters,
	I here bestow a simple instrument,
	And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
	If you accept them, then their worth is great.
</TRANIO>

<BAPTISTA>	<35%>
	Lucentio is your name, of whence, I pray?
</BAPTISTA>

<TRANIO>	<35%>
	Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.
</TRANIO>

<BAPTISTA>	<35%>
	A mighty man of Pisa; by report
	I know him well: you are very welcome, sir.
<STAGE DIR>
<To Hortensio.] Take you the lute, [To Lucentio.>
</STAGE DIR> and you the set of books;
	You shall go see your pupils presently.
	Holla, within!

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter a Servant.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
	To my two daughters, and then tell them both
	These are their tutors: bid them use them well.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Servant, with Hortensio, Lucentio, and Biondello.>
</STAGE DIR>
	We will go walk a little in the orchard,
	And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
</BAPTISTA>
	And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
<PETRUCHIO>	<35%>
	Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
	And every day I cannot come to woo.
	You knew my father well, and in him me,
	Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
	Which I have better'd rather than decreas'd:
	Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
	What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
</PETRUCHIO>

<BAPTISTA>	<36%>
	After my death the one half of my lands,
	And in possession twenty thousand crowns.
</BAPTISTA>

<PETRUCHIO>	<36%>
	And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of
	Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
	In all my lands and leases whatsoever.
	Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,
	That covenants may be kept on either hand.
</PETRUCHIO>

<BAPTISTA>	<36%>
	Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
	That is, her love; for that is all in all.
</BAPTISTA>

<PETRUCHIO>	<36%>
	Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, father,
	I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
	And where two raging fires meet together
	They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
	Though little fire grows great with little wind,
	Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all;
	So I to her, and so she yields to me;
	For I am rough and woo not like a babe.
</PETRUCHIO>

<BAPTISTA>	<36%>
	Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
	But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.
</BAPTISTA>

<PETRUCHIO>	<36%>
	Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,
	That shake not, though they blow perpetually.

</PETRUCHIO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Hortensio, with his head broke.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BAPTISTA>	<36%>
	How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?
</BAPTISTA>

<HORTENSIO>	<36%>
	For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
</HORTENSIO>

<BAPTISTA>	<37%>
	What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
</BAPTISTA>

<HORTENSIO>	<37%>
	I think she'll sooner prove a soldier:
	Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.
</HORTENSIO>

<BAPTISTA>	<37%>
	Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
</BAPTISTA>

<HORTENSIO>	<37%>
	Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
	I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
	And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;
	When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
	'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume with them;'
	And, with that word, she struck me on the head,
	And through the instrument my pate made way;
	And there I stood amazed for a while,
	As on a pillory, looking through the lute;
	While she did call me rascal fiddler,
	And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms
	As she had studied to misuse me so.
</HORTENSIO>

<PETRUCHIO>	<37%>
	Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench!
	I love her ten times more than e'er I did:
	O! how I long to have some chat with her!
</PETRUCHIO>

<BAPTISTA>	<37%>
<STAGE DIR>
<To Hortensio.>
</STAGE DIR> Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited:
	Proceed in practice with my younger daughter;
	She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.
	Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
	Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
</BAPTISTA>

<PETRUCHIO>	<37%>
	I pray you do; I will attend her here,
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Baptista, Gremio, Tranio, and Hortensio.>
</STAGE DIR>
	And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
	Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain
	She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
	Say that she frown; I'll say she looks as clear
	As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:
	Say she be mute and will not speak a word;
	Then I'll commend her volubility,
	And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
	If she do bid me pack; I'll give her thanks,
	As though she bid me stay by her a week:
	If she deny to wed; I'll crave the day
	When I shall ask the banns, and when be married.
	But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.

</PETRUCHIO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Katharina.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.
<KATHARINA>	<38%>
	Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
	They call me Katharine that do talk of me.
</KATHARINA>

<PETRUCHIO>	<38%>
	You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,
	And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst;
	But, Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom;
	Kate of Kate-Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
	For dainties are all cates: and therefore, Kate,
	Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;
	Hearing thy mildness prais'd in every town,
	Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,—
	Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,—
	Myself am mov'd to woo thee for my wife.
</PETRUCHIO>

<KATHARINA>	<38%>
	Mov'd! in good time: let him that mov'd you hither
	Remove you hence. I knew you at the first,
	You were a moveable.
</KATHARINA>

<PETRUCHIO>	<39%>
	Why, what's a moveable?
</PETRUCHIO>

<KATHARINA>	<39%>
	A joint-stool.

	Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;
	For, knowing thee to be but young and light,—
</PETRUCHIO>

<KATHARINA>	<39%>
	Too light for such a swain as you to catch,
	And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
</KATHARINA>

<PETRUCHIO>	<39%>
	Should be! should buz!
</PETRUCHIO>

<KATHARINA>	<39%>

	O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?

	Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.

<PETRUCHIO>	<39%>
	Come, come, you wasp; i' faith you are too angry.

<KATHARINA>	<39%>
	If I be waspish, best beware my sting.

	Yours, if you talk of tails; and so farewell.

	Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.
</PETRUCHIO>

<KATHARINA>	<40%>
	It is my fashion when I see a crab.
</KATHARINA>

	Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
</PETRUCHIO>

<KATHARINA>	<40%>
	I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.
</KATHARINA>

<PETRUCHIO>	<40%>
	No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.
	'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,
	And now I find report a very liar;
	For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
	But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:
	Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
	Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will;
	Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk;
	But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
	With gentle conference, soft and affable.
	Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
	O slanderous world! Kate, like the hazel-twig,
	Is straight and slender, and as brown in hue
	As hazel nuts, and sweeter than the kernels.
	O! let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.

	Yes; keep you warm.

<PETRUCHIO>	<41%>
	Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharine, in thy bed:
	And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
	Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
	That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
	And will you, nill you, I will marry you.
	Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
	For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,—
	Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,—
	Thou must be married to no man but me:
	For I am he am born to tame you, Kate;
	And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
	Conformable as other household Kates.
	Here comes your father: never make denial;
	I must and will have Katharine to my wife.

</BAPTISTA>

<KATHARINA>	<42%>
	Call you me daughter? now, I promise you
	You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,
	To wish me wed to one half lunatic;
	A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
	That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
</KATHARINA>

<PETRUCHIO>	<42%>
	Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,
	That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:
	If she be curst, it is for policy,
	For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
	She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
	For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
	And Roman Lucrece for her chastity;
	And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,
	That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.
</PETRUCHIO>

<KATHARINA>	<42%>
	I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.

<PETRUCHIO>	<42%>
	Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself:
	If she and I be pleas'd, what's that to you?
	'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
	That she shall still be curst in company.
	I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe
	How much she loves me: O! the kindest Kate.
	She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss
	She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
	That in a twink she won me to her love.
	O! you are novices: 'tis a world to see,
	How tame, when men and women are alone,
	A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
	Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice
	To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
	Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
	I will be sure my Katharine shall be fine.

	And I am one that love Bianca more

</TRANIO>

<BAPTISTA>	<44%>
	Content you, gentlemen; I'll compound this strife:
	'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he, of both,
	That can assure my daughter greatest dower
	Shall have my Bianca's love.
	Say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?
</BAPTISTA>

<GREMIO>	<44%>
	First, as you know, my house within the city
	Is richly furnished with plate and gold:
	Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
	My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
	In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
	In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
	Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
	Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
	Valance of Venice gold in needle-work,
	Pewter and brass, and all things that belong
	To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
	I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
	Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
	And all things answerable to this portion.
	Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
	And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,
	If whilst I live she will be only mine.
</GREMIO>

<TRANIO>	<45%>
	That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
	I am my father's heir and only son:
	If I may have your daughter to my wife,
	I'll leave her houses three or four as good,
	Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
	Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
	Besides two thousand ducats by the year
	Of fruitful land, all of which shall be her jointure.
	What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?
</TRANIO>

<GREMIO>	<45%>
	Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
	My land amounts not to so much in all:
	That she shall have; besides an argosy
	That now is lying in Marseilles' road.
	What, have I chok'd you with an argosy?
</GREMIO>

<TRANIO>	<45%>
	Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
	Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses,
	And twelve tight galleys; these I will assure her,
	And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.
</TRANIO>

<GREMIO>	<45%>
	Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;
	And she can have no more than all I have:
	If you like me, she shall have me and mine.
</GREMIO>

<TRANIO>	<45%>
	Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
	By your firm promise. Gremio is out-vied.
</TRANIO>

<BAPTISTA>	<46%>
	I must confess your offer is the best;
	And, let your father make her the assurance,
	She is your own; else, you must pardon me:
	If you should die before him, where's her dower?
</BAPTISTA>

<TRANIO>	<46%>
	That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.

<BAPTISTA>	<46%>
	Well, gentlemen,
	I am thus resolv'd. On Sunday next, you know,
	My daughter Katharine is to be married:
	Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
	Be bride to you, if you make this assurance;
	If not, to Signior Gremio:
	And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.

<GREMIO>	<46%>
	Adieu, good neighbour. <STAGE DIR>
<Exit Baptista.>

	Must get a father, called 'suppos'd Vincentio;'

</HORTENSIO>

<LUCENTIO>	<47%>
	Preposterous ass, that never read so far

	Madam, before you touch the instrument,

	'Gamut' I am, the ground of all accord,

	'D sol re,' one clef, two notes have I:
	'E la mi,' show pity, or I die.

</BAPTISTA>

<KATHARINA>	<51%>
	No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forc'd

	Unto a mad-brain rudesby, full of spleen;
	Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
	I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
	Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour;
	And to be noted for a merry man,
	He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
	Make friends invite, and proclaim the banns;
	Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
	Now must the world point at poor Katharine,
	And say, 'Lo! there is mad Petruchio's wife,
	If it would please him come and marry her.'
</KATHARINA>

<TRANIO>	<51%>
	Patience, good Katharine, and Baptista too.
	Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,

	Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
	Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.

	But, say, what to thine old news?
</TRANIO>

<BIONDELLO>	<52%>
	Why, Petruchio is coming, in a new hat and an old jerkin; a pair of old breeches thrice turned; a pair of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled, another laced; an old rusty sword ta'en out of the town-armoury, with a broken hilt, and chapeless; with two broken points: his horse hipped with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred; besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected with the fashions, full of windgalls, sped with spavins, rayed with the yellows, past cure of the fives, stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the bots, swayed in the back, and shoulder-shotten; near-legged before, and with a half-checked bit, and a head-stall of sheep's leather, which, being restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth six times pieced, and a woman's crupper of velure, which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.
</BIONDELLO>

<BAPTISTA>	<53%>
	Who comes with him?
</BAPTISTA>

<BIONDELLO>	<53%>
	O, sir! his lackey, for all the world caparisoned like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red and blue list; an old hat, and the 'humour of forty fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman's lackey.
</BIONDELLO>

<TRANIO>	<53%>
	'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
	Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.

	I am glad he is come, howsoe'er he comes.
</BAPTISTA>

<BIONDELLO>	<53%>

</BIONDELLO>

<BAPTISTA>	<53%>
	Ay, that Petruchio came.
</BAPTISTA>

<BIONDELLO>	<53%>
	No, sir; I say his horse comes, with him on his back.
</BIONDELLO>

<BAPTISTA>	<53%>
	Why, that's all one.
</BAPTISTA>

<BIONDELLO>	<53%>

	An eye-sore to our solemn festival.
</BAPTISTA>

	Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:
	Sufficeth, I am come to keep my word,
	Though in some part enforced to digress;
	Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse
	As you shall well be satisfied withal.
	But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:
	The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.
</PETRUCHIO>

<TRANIO>	<54%>
	See not your bride in these unreverent robes:
	Go to my chamber; put on clothes of mine.
</TRANIO>

<PETRUCHIO>	<54%>
	Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.
</PETRUCHIO>

<BAPTISTA>	<54%>
	But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
</BAPTISTA>

<PETRUCHIO>	<54%>
	Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:
	To me she's married, not unto my clothes.
	Could I repair what she will wear in me
	As I can change these poor accoutrements,

	I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
	Should ask, if Katharine should be his wife,
	'Ay, by gogs-wouns!' quoth he; and swore so loud,
	That, all amaz'd, the priest let fall the book;
	And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,
	The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
	That down fell priest and book and book and priest:
	'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'
</GREMIO>

<TRANIO>	<56%>
	What said the wench when he arose again?
</TRANIO>

<GREMIO>	<56%>
	Trembled and shook; for why he stampt and swore,
	As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
	But after many ceremonies done,
	He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he; as if
	He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
	After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel,
	And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
	Having no other reason
	But that his beard grew thin and hungerly,
	And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
	This done, he took the bride about the neck,
	And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
	That at the parting all the church did echo:
	And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame;
	And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
	Such a mad marriage never was before.
	Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Grumio.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GRUMIO>	<60%>
	Fie, fie, on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? was ever man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent before to make a fire, and they are coming after to warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me; but I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for, considering the weather, a taller man than I will take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.

</GRUMIO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Curtis.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CURTIS>	<60%>
	Who is that calls so coldly?
</CURTIS>

<GRUMIO>	<60%>
	A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck. A fire, good Curtis.
</GRUMIO>

<CURTIS>	<60%>
	Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
</CURTIS>

<GRUMIO>	<60%>
	O! ay, Curtis, ay; and therefore fire, fire; cast on no water.
</GRUMIO>

<CURTIS>	<60%>
	Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
</CURTIS>

<GRUMIO>	<60%>
	She was, good Curtis, before this frost; but, thou knowest, winter tames man, woman, and beast; for it hath tamed my old master, and my new mistress, and myself, fellow Curtis.
</GRUMIO>

<CURTIS>	<60%>
	Away, you three-inch-fool! I am no beast.
</CURTIS>

<GRUMIO>	<61%>
	Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress, whose hand,—she being now at hand,—thou shalt soon feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?
</GRUMIO>

<CURTIS>	<61%>
	I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?
</CURTIS>

<GRUMIO>	<61%>
	A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and therefore, fire. Do thy duty, and have thy duty, for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.
</GRUMIO>

<CURTIS>	<61%>
	There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news?
</CURTIS>

<GRUMIO>	<61%>
	Why, 'Jack, boy! ho, boy!' and as much news as thou wilt.
</GRUMIO>

<CURTIS>	<61%>
	Come, you are so full of cony-catching.
</CURTIS>

<GRUMIO>	<61%>
	Why therefore fire: for I have caught extreme cold. Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the serving-men in their new fustian, their white stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on? Be the Jacks fair within, the Jills fair without, and carpets laid, and everything in order?
</GRUMIO>

<CURTIS>	<61%>
	All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news?
</CURTIS>

	And therefore it is called a sensible tale; and this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,—
</GRUMIO>

<CURTIS>	<62%>
	Both of one horse?
</CURTIS>

<GRUMIO>	<62%>
	What's that to thee?
</GRUMIO>

<CURTIS>	<62%>
	Why, a horse.
</CURTIS>

<GRUMIO>	<62%>
	Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell, and she under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place, how she was bemoiled: how he left her with the horse upon her; how he beat me because her horse stumbled; how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me: how he swore; how she prayed, that never prayed before; how I cried; how the horses ran away; how her bridle was burst; how I lost my crupper; with many things of worthy memory, which now shall die in oblivion, and thou return unexperienced to thy grave.
</GRUMIO>

<CURTIS>	<62%>
	By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.
</CURTIS>

<GRUMIO>	<62%>
	Ay; and that, thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home. But what talk I of this? Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest: let their heads be sleekly combed, their blue coats brushed, and their garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy with their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair of my master's horsetail till they kiss their hands. Are they all ready?

	They are.

<GRUMIO>	<63%>
	Call them forth.

	My falcon now is sharp and passing empty,

	For then she never looks upon her lure.
	Another way I have to man my haggard,
	To make her come and know her keeper's call;
	That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
	That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
	She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
	Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not:
	As with the meat, some undeserved fault
	I'll find about the making of the bed;
	And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
	This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:
	Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
	That all is done in reverend care of her;
	And in conclusion she shall watch all night:
	And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl,
	And with the clamour keep her still awake.
	This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;
	And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
	He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
	Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.

<TRANIO>	<68%>
	O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
	I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.
</TRANIO>

<HORTENSIO>	<68%>
	Mistake no more: I am not Licio,
	Nor a musician, as I seem to be;
	But one that scorns to live in this disguise,
	For such a one as leaves a gentleman,
	And makes a god of such a cullion:
	Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.
</HORTENSIO>

<TRANIO>	<68%>
	Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
	Of your entire affection to Bianca;
	And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
	I will with you, if you be so contented,
	Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
</TRANIO>

<HORTENSIO>	<68%>
	See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
	Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
	Never to woo her more; but I do forswear her,
	As one unworthy all the former favours
	That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.
</HORTENSIO>

<TRANIO>	<68%>
	And here I take the like unfeigned oath,
	Never to marry with her though she would entreat.
	Fie on her! see how beastly she doth court him.
</TRANIO>

<HORTENSIO>	<69%>
	Would all the world, but he had quite forsworn!
	For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
	I will be married to a wealthy widow
	Ere three days pass, which hath as long lov'd me
	As I have lov'd this proud disdainful haggard.
	And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
	Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
	Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,
	In resolution as I swore before.

</TRANIO>

<BIANCA>	<69%>
	Tranio, you jest. But have you both forsworn me?
</BIANCA>

<TRANIO>	<69%>
	Mistress, we have.

<BIANCA>	<69%>
	He says so, Tranio.
</BIANCA>

<TRANIO>	<69%>
	Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.
</TRANIO>

<BIANCA>	<69%>
	The taming-school! what, is there such a place?
</BIANCA>

<TRANIO>	<69%>
	Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;

<PEDANT>	<70%>
	My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.
</PEDANT>

<TRANIO>	<70%>
	'Tis death for any one in Mantua
	To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
	Your ships are stay'd at Venice; and the duke,—
	For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,—
	Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly.
	'Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come,
	You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.
</TRANIO>

<PEDANT>	<71%>
	Alas, sir! it is worse for me than so;
	For I have bills for money by exchange
	From Florence, and must here deliver them.
</PEDANT>

<TRANIO>	<71%>
	Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
	This will I do, and this I will advise you:
	First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?
</TRANIO>

<PEDANT>	<71%>
	Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been;
	Pisa, renowned for grave citizens.

<PEDANT>	<71%>
	I know him not, but I have heard of him;
	A merchant of incomparable wealth.
</PEDANT>

<TRANIO>	<71%>
	He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
	In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.
</TRANIO>

<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> As much as an apple doth an oyster, and all one.
</BIONDELLO>

<TRANIO>	<71%>
	To save your life in this extremity,
	This favour will I do you for his sake;
	And think it not the worst of all your fortunes
	That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
	His name and credit shall you undertake,
	And in my house you shall be friendly lodg'd,
	Look that you take upon you as you should!
	You understand me, sir; so shall you stay
	Till you have done your business in the city.
	If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.
</TRANIO>

<PEDANT>	<72%>
	O sir, I do; and will repute you ever
	The patron of my life and liberty.
</PEDANT>

<TRANIO>	<72%>
	Then go with me to make the matter good.
	This, by the way, I let you understand:
	My father is here look'd for every day,
	To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
	'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:
	In all these circumstances I'll instruct you.
	Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.

	The more my wrong the more his spite appears.
	What, did he marry me to famish me?
	Beggars, that come unto my father's door,
	Upon entreaty have a present alms;
	If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:
	But I, who never knew how to entreat,
	Nor never needed that I should entreat,
	Am starv'd for meat, giddy for lack of sleep;
	With oaths kept waking, and with brawling fed.
	And that which spites me more than all these wants,
	He does it under name of perfect love;
	As who should say, if I should sleep or eat
	'Twere deadly sickness, or else present death.
	I prithee go and get me some repast;

</KATHARINA>

<KATHARINA>	<73%>
	Why, then the beef, and let the mustard rest.
</KATHARINA>

<GRUMIO>	<73%>
	Nay, then I will not: you shall have the mustard,
	Or else you get no beef of Grumio.
</GRUMIO>

<KATHARINA>	<73%>
	Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.
</KATHARINA>

<GRUMIO>	<73%>
	Why then, the mustard without the beef.

	With silken coats and caps and golden rings,
	With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things;

	Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
	A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:

	Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.
</PETRUCHIO>

<KATHARINA>	<75%>
	I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,

	Your betters have endur'd me say my mind,
	And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
	My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
	Or else my heart, concealing it, will break:
	And rather than it shall, I will be free

<PEDANT>	<80%>
	Soft, son!
	Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua
	To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
	Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
	Of love between your daughter and himself:
	And,—for the good report I hear of you,
	And for the love he beareth to your daughter,
	And she to him,—to stay him not too long,
	I am content, in a good father's care,
	To have him match'd; and, if you please to like
	No worse than I, upon some agreement
	Me shall you find ready and willing
	With one consent to have her so bestow'd;
	For curious I cannot be with you,
	Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.
</PEDANT>

<BAPTISTA>	<81%>
	Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:
	Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
	Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
	Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,
	Or both dissemble deeply their affections:
	And therefore, if you say no more than this,
	That like a father you will deal with him
	And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
	The match is made, and all is done:
	Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
</BAPTISTA>

<TRANIO>	<81%>
	I thank you, sir. Where, then, do you know best
	We be affied and such assurance ta'en
	As shall with either part's agreement stand?
</TRANIO>

<BAPTISTA>	<81%>
	Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,
	Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants.
	Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still,
	And happily we might be interrupted.
</BAPTISTA>

<TRANIO>	<81%>
	Then at my lodging an it like you:
	There doth my father lie, and there this night
	We'll pass the business privately and well.
	Send for your daughter by your servant here;
	My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
	The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,
	You're like to have a thin and slender pittance.
</TRANIO>

<BAPTISTA>	<82%>
	It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,
	And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
	And, if you will, tell what hath happened:
	Lucentio's father is arriv'd in Padua,
	And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.
</BAPTISTA>

<LUCENTIO>	<82%>
	I pray the gods she may with all my heart!

	I cannot tell, expect they are busied about a counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her, cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum. To the church! take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient honest witnesses.

<KATHARINA>	<85%>
	Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,

	The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
	Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
	Nor be not griev'd: she is of good esteem,
	Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth;
	Beside, so qualified as may beseem
	The spouse of any noble gentleman.
	Let me embrace with old Vincentio;
	And wander we to see thy honest son,

	Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,

<TRANIO>	<94%>
	O sir! Lucentio slipp'd me, like his greyhound,
	Which runs himself, and catches for his master.
</TRANIO>

<PETRUCHIO>	<95%>
	A good swift simile, but something currish.
</PETRUCHIO>

<TRANIO>	<95%>
	'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:
	'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.

	O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.

<BAPTISTA>	<95%>
	Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
	I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.

	Well, I say no: and therefore, for assurance,
	Let's each one send unto his wife;

</HORTENSIO>

<LUCENTIO>	<95%>
	Twenty crowns.

	Twenty crowns!
	I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,

<LUCENTIO>	<95%>
	A hundred then.

	And so it is. I wonder what it bodes.

	Now fair befall thee, good Petruchio!
	The wager thou hast won; and I will add

</BAPTISTA>

<PETRUCHIO>	<97%>
	Nay, I will win my wager better yet,

	The more fool you for laying on my duty.
</BIANCA>

<PETRUCHIO>	<98%>
	Katharine, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women

	Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.

<PETRUCHIO>	<98%>
	Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
</PETRUCHIO>

<WIDOW>	<98%>
	She shall not.
</WIDOW>

<PETRUCHIO>	<98%>
	I say she shall: and first begin with her.
</PETRUCHIO>

<KATHARINA>	<98%>
	Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
	And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
	To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
	It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
	Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
	And in no sense is meet or amiable.
	A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled,
	Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
	And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
	Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
	Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
	Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
	And for thy maintenance commits his body
	To painful labour both by sea and land,
	To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
	Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
	And craves no other tribute at thy hands
	But love, fair looks, and true obedience;
	Too little payment for so great a debt.
	Such duty as the subject owes the prince,
	Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
	And when she's froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
	And not obedient to his honest will,
	What is she but a foul contending rebel,
	And graceless traitor to her loving lord?—
	I am asham'd that women are so simple
	To offer war where they should kneel for peace,
	Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,
	When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.
	Why are our bodies soft, and weak, and smooth,
	Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
	But that our soft conditions and our hearts
	Should well agree with our external parts?
	Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
	My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
	My heart as great, my reason haply more,
	To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
	But now I see our lances are but straws,
	Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
	That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
	Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
	And place your hands below your husband's foot:
	In token of which duty, if he please,
	My hand is ready; may it do him ease.
</KATHARINA>

<PETRUCHIO>	<99%>
	Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.
</PETRUCHIO>

<LUCENTIO>	<100%>
	Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha't.
</LUCENTIO>

<VINCENTIO>	<100%>
	'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
</VINCENTIO>

<LUCENTIO>	<100%>
	But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
</LUCENTIO>

<PETRUCHIO>	<100%>
	Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
	We three are married, but you two are sped.
	'Twas I won the wager, <STAGE DIR>
