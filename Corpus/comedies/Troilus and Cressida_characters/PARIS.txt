	Else might the world convince of levity
	As well my undertakings as your counsels;
	But I attest the gods, your full consent
	Gave wings to my propension and cut off
	All fears attending on so dire a project:
	For what, alas! can these my single arms?
	What propugnation is in one man's valour,
	To stand the push and enmity of those
	This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,
	Were I alone to pass the difficulties,
	And had as ample power as I have will,
	Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,
	Nor faint in the pursuit.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	Sir, I propose not merely to myself
	The pleasure such a beauty brings with it;
	But I would have the soil of her fair rape
	Wip'd off, in honourable keeping her.
	What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,
	Disgrace to your great worths, and shame to me,
	Now to deliver her possession up,
	On terms of base compulsion! Can it be
	That so degenerate a strain as this
	Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?
	There's not the meanest spirit on our party
	Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
	When Helen is defended, nor none so noble
	Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfam'd
	Where Helen is the subject: then, I say,
	Well may we fight for her, whom, we know well,
	The world's large spaces cannot parallel.

	You have broke it, cousin; and, by my life, you shall make it whole again: you shall piece it out with a piece of your performance. Nell, he is full of harmony.

	Well said, my lord! Well, you say so in fits.

	What exploit's in hand? where sups he to-night?

	I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Well, I'll make excuse.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	I spy.

	Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.

	Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the gallantry of Troy: I would fain have armed to-day, but my Nell would not have it so. How chance my brother Troilus went not?

	They're come from field: let us to Priam's hall
	To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you
	To help unarm our Hector: his stubborn buckles,
	With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,
	Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
	Or force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more
	Than all the island kings,—disarm great Hector.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Sweet, above thought I love thee.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
	See, ho! who is that there?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
	A valiant Greek, Æneas; take his hand:
	Witness the process of your speech, wherein
	You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
	Did haunt you in the field.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
	This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,
	The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.
	What business, lord, so early?
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek
	To Calchas' house, and there to render him,
	For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid.
	Let's have your company; or, if you please,
	Haste there before us. I constantly do think—
	Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge—
	My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:
	Rouse him and give him note of our approach,
	With the whole quality wherefore: I fear
	We shall be much unwelcome.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	There is no help;
	The bitter disposition of the time
	Will have it so. On, lord; we'll follow you.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	And tell me, noble Diomed; faith, tell me true,
	Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,
	Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best—
	Myself or Menelaus?
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	You are too bitter to your country-woman.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,
	Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy;
	But we in silence hold this virtue well,
	We'll not commend what we intend to sell.
	Here lies our way.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 3><65%>
	It is great morning, and the hour prefix'd
	Of her delivery to this valiant Greek
	Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus,
	Tell you the lady what she is to do,
	And haste her to the purpose.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 3><66%>
	I know what 'tis to love;
	And would, as I shall pity, I could help!
	Please you walk in, my lords.

	</STAGE DIR> Brother Troilus!
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 4><70%>
	Hark! Hector's trumpet.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 4><70%>
	'Tis Troilus' fault. Come, come, to field with him.
