	No harm.
	I have done nothing but in care of thee,—
	Of thee, my dear one! thee, my daughter!—who

	'Tis time

	The hour's now come,

	Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and

<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	Both, both, my girl:
	By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heav'd thence;

<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio,—
	I pray thee, mark me,—that a brother should
	Be so perfidious!—he whom next thyself,
	Of all the world I lov'd, and to him put
	The manage of my state; as at that time,
	Through all the signiories it was the first,
	And Prospero the prime duke; being so reputed
	In dignity, and for the liberal arts,
	Without a parallel: those being all my study,
	The government I cast upon my brother,
	And to my state grew stranger, being transported
	And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle—
	Dost thou attend me?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	Being once perfected how to grant suits,
	How to deny them, who t'advance, and who
	To trash for over-topping; new created
	The creatures that were mine, I say, or chang'd 'em,
	Or else new form'd 'em: having both the key
	Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
	To what tune pleas'd his ear; that now he was
	The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
	And suck'd my verdure out on't.—Thou attend'st not.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	I pray thee, mark me.
	I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
	To closeness and the bettering of my mind
	With that, which, but by being so retir'd,
	O'erpriz'd all popular rate, in my false brother
	Awak'd an evil nature; and my trust,
	Like a good parent, did beget of him
	A falsehood in its contrary as great
	As my trust was; which had, indeed no limit,
	A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
	Not only with what my revenue yielded,
	But what my power might else exact,—like one,
	Who having, into truth, by telling of it,
	Made such a sinner of his memory,
	To credit his own lie,—he did believe
	He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution,
	And executing th' outward face of royalty,
	With all prerogative:—Hence his ambition growing,—
	Dost thou hear?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	To have no screen between this part he play'd
	And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
	Absolute Milan. Me, poor man,—my library
	Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
	He thinks me now incapable; confederates,—
	So dry he was for sway,—wi' the king of Naples
	To give him annual tribute, do him homage;
	Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend
	The dukedom, yet unbow'd,—alas, poor Milan!—
	To most ignoble stooping.

	Mark his condition and the event; then tell me

<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	Now the condition.
	This King of Naples, being an enemy
	To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
	Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
	Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
	Should presently extirpate me and mine
	Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan,
	With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
	A treacherous army levied, one midnight
	Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
	The gates of Milan; and, i' the dead of darkness,
	The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
	Me and thy crying self.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	Hear a little further,
	And then I'll bring thee to the present business
	Which now's upon us; without the which this story

<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	Well demanded, wench:
	My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
	So dear the love my people bore me, nor set
	A mark so bloody on the business; but
	With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
	In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
	Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepar'd
	A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
	Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
	Instinctively have quit it: there they hoist us,
	To cry to the sea that roar'd to us; to sigh
	To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
	Did us but loving wrong.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	O, a cherubin
	Thou wast, that did preserve me! Thou didst smile,
	Infused with a fortitude from heaven,

	Under my burden groan'd; which rais'd in me
	An undergoing stomach, to bear up
	Against what should ensue.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	By Providence divine.
	Some food we had and some fresh water that
	A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
	Out of his charity,—who being then appointed
	Master of this design,—did give us; with
	Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries,
	Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
	Knowing I lov'd my books, he furnish'd me,
	From mine own library with volumes that
	I prize above my dukedom.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	Now I arise:—
	Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
	Here in this island we arriv'd; and here

	For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>

	By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,

	A most auspicious star, whose influence
	If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
	Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions;
	Thou art inclin'd to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,

	Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot

	Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 1><SCENE 2><16%>
	O! was she so? I must,

	Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch, Sycorax,
	For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
	To enter human hearing, from Argier,
	Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did
	They would not take her life. Is not this true?
<SPEECH 36><ACT 1><SCENE 2><17%>
	This blue-ey'd hag was hither brought with child
	And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
	As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant:
	And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
	To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
	Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
	By help of her more potent ministers,
	And in her most unmitigable rage,
	Into a cloven pine; within which rift
	Imprison'd, thou didst painfully remain
	A dozen years; within which space she died
	And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans
	As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island,—
	Save for the son that she did litter here,
	A freckled whelp hag-born,—not honour'd with
	A human shape.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 1><SCENE 2><17%>
	Dull thing, I say so; he that Caliban,
	Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
	What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
	Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
	Of ever-angry bears: it was a torment
	To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
	Could not again undo; it was mine art,
	When I arriv'd and heard thee, that made gape
	The pine, and let thee out.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 1><SCENE 2><18%>

	Abhorred slave,

	Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
	A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
	With words that made them known: but thy vile race,
	Though thou didst learn, had that in't which good natures
	Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
	Deservedly confin'd into this rock,
	Who hadst deserv'd more than a prison.

<SPEECH 83><ACT 4><SCENE 1><78%>
	Spirit,
	We must prepare to meet with Caliban.
<SPEECH 84><ACT 4><SCENE 1><79%>
	Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?
<SPEECH 85><ACT 4><SCENE 1><79%>
	This was well done, my bird.
	Thy shape invisible retain thou still:
	The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,
	For stale to catch these thieves.
<SPEECH 86><ACT 4><SCENE 1><79%>
	A devil, a born devil, on whose nature
	Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
	Humanely taken, are all lost, quite lost;
	And as with age his body uglier grows,
	So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,
	Even to roaring.
	Come, hang them on this line.
<SPEECH 87><ACT 4><SCENE 1><83%>
	Hey, Mountain, hey!
<SPEECH 88><ACT 4><SCENE 1><83%>
	Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark, hark!
	Go, charge my goblins that they grind their joints
	With dry convulsions; shorten up their sinews
	With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them
	Than pard, or cat o' mountain.
<SPEECH 89><ACT 4><SCENE 1><83%>
	Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour
	Lie at my mercy all mine enemies:
	Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou
	Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little,
	Follow, and do me service.
<SPEECH 90><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	Now does my project gather to a head:
	My charms crack not; my spirits obey, and time
	Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?
<SPEECH 91><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	I did say so,
	When first I rais'd the tempest. Say, my spirit,
	How fares the king and's followers?
<SPEECH 92><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	Dost thou think so, spirit?
<SPEECH 93><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	And mine shall.
	Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling
	Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
	One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,
	Passion as they, be kindlier mov'd than thou art?
	Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,
	Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury
	Do I take part: the rarer action is
	In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,
	The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
	Not a frown further. Go, release them, Ariel.
	My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,
	And they shall be themselves.
<SPEECH 94><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves;
	And ye, that on the sands with printless foot
	Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him
	When he comes back; you demi-puppets, that
	By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make
	Whereof the ewe not bites; and you, whose pastime
	Is to make midnight mushrooms; that rejoice
	To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,—
	Weak masters though ye be—I have bedimm'd
	The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
	And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault
	Set roaring war: to the dread-rattling thunder
	Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak
	With his own bolt: the strong-bas'd promontory
	Have I made shake; and by the spurs pluck'd up
	The pine and cedar: graves at my command
	Have wak'd their sleepers, op'd, and let them forth
	By my so potent art. But this rough magic
	I here abjure; and, when I have requir'd
	Some heavenly music,—which even now I do,—
	To work mine end upon their senses that
	This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
	Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
	And, deeper than did ever plummet sound,
	I'll drown my book.
	A solemn air and the best comforter
	To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,
	Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
	For you are spell-stopp'd.
	Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
	Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,
	Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace;
	And as the morning steals upon the night,
	Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
	Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
	Their clearer reason.—O good Gonzalo!
	My true preserver, and a loyal sir
	To him thou follow'st, I will pay thy graces
	Home, both in word and deed.—Most cruelly
	Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:
	Thy brother was a furtherer in the act;—
	Thou'rt pinch'd for't now, Sebastian.—Flesh and blood,
	You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
	Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,—
	Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,—
	Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,
	Unnatural though thou art!—Their understanding
	Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
	Will shortly fill the reasonable shores
	That now lie foul and muddy. Not one of them
	That yet looks on me, or would know me.—Ariel,
	Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:—
	I will discase me, and myself present,
	As I was sometime Milan.—Quickly, spirit;
	Thou shalt ere long be free.
<SPEECH 95><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee;
	But yet thou shalt have freedom;—so, so, so.—
	To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:
	There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
	Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain
	Being awake, enforce them to this place,
	And presently, I prithee.
<SPEECH 96><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	Behold, sir king,
	The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero.
	For more assurance that a living prince
	Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;
	And to thee and thy company I bid
	A hearty welcome.
<SPEECH 97><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	First, noble friend,
	Let me embrace thine age; whose honour cannot
	Be measur'd, or confin'd.
<SPEECH 98><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	You do yet taste
	Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you
	Believe things certain.—Welcome! my friends all:—
	</STAGE DIR> But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,
	I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you,
	And justify you traitors: at this time
	I will tell no tales.
<SPEECH 99><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	No.
	For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother
	Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive
	Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require
	My dukedom of thee, which, perforce, I know,
	Thou must restore.
<SPEECH 100><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	I am woe for't, sir.
<SPEECH 101><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	I rather think
	You have not sought her help; of whose soft grace,
	For the like loss I have her sovereign aid,
	And rest myself content.
<SPEECH 102><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	As great to me, as late; and, supportable
	To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker
	Than you may call to comfort you, for I
	Have lost my daughter.
<SPEECH 103><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	In this last tempest. I perceive, these lords
	At this encounter do so much admire
	That they devour their reason, and scarce think
	Their eyes do offices of truth, their words
	Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have
	Been justled from your senses, know for certain
	That I am Prospero and that very duke
	Which was thrust forth of Milan; who most strangely
	Upon this shore, where you were wrack'd, was landed,
	To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;
	For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,
	Not a relation for a breakfast nor
	Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;
	This cell's my court: here have I few attendants
	And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.
	My dukedom since you have given me again,
	I will requite you with as good a thing;
	At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye
	As much as me my dukedom.
<SPEECH 104><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	'Tis new to thee.
<SPEECH 105><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	There, sir, stop:
	Let us not burden our remembrances
	With a heaviness that's gone.
<SPEECH 106><ACT 5><SCENE 1><95%>
	</STAGE DIR> My tricksy spirit!
<SPEECH 107><ACT 5><SCENE 1><95%>
	</STAGE DIR> Bravely, my diligence! Thou shalt be free.
<SPEECH 108><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
	Sir, my liege,
	Do not infest your mind with beating on
	The strangeness of this business: at pick'd leisure
	Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,—
	Which to you shall seem probable,—of every
	These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful,
	And think of each thing well.—<STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Come hither, spirit;
	Set Caliban and his companions free;
	Untie the spell. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> How fares my gracious sir?
	There are yet missing of your company
	Some few odd lads that you remember not.
<SPEECH 109><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
	Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
	Then say, if they be true.—This mis-shapen knave,—
	His mother was a witch; and one so strong
	That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,
	And deal in her command without her power.
	These three have robb'd me; and this demidevil,—
	For he's a bastard one,—had plotted with them
	To take my life: two of these fellows you
	Must know and own; this thing of darkness I
	Acknowledge mine.
<SPEECH 110><ACT 5><SCENE 1><98%>
	You'd be king of the isle, sirrah?
<SPEECH 111><ACT 5><SCENE 1><98%>
	He is as disproportion'd in his manners As in his shape.—Go, sirrah, to my cell;
	Take with you your companions: as you look
	To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.
<SPEECH 112><ACT 5><SCENE 1><98%>
	Go to; away!
<SPEECH 113><ACT 5><SCENE 1><98%>
	Sir, I invite your highness and your train
	To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
	For this one night; which—part of it—I'll waste
	With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
	Go quick away; the story of my life
	And the particular accidents gone by
	Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
	I'll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,
	Where I have hope to see the nuptial
	Of these our dear-beloved solemniz'd;
	And thence retire me to my Milan, where
	Every third thought shall be my grave.
<SPEECH 114><ACT 5><SCENE 1><99%>
	I'll deliver all;
	And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales
	And sail so expeditious that shall catch
	Your royal fleet far off.—<STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> My Ariel, chick,
	That is thy charge: then to the elements
	Be free, and fare thou well!—Please you, draw near.
	<Spoken by> 
<SPEECH 115><ACT 5><SCENE 1><99%>
	Now my charms are all o'erthrown,
	And what strength I have's mine own;
	Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,
	I must be here confin'd by you,
	Or sent to Naples Let me not,
	Since I have my dukedom got
	And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell
	In this bare island by your spell;
	But release me from my bands
	With the help of your good hands.
	Gentle breath of yours my sails
	Must fill, or else my project fails,
	Which was to please. Now I want
	Spirits to enforce, art to enchant;
	And my ending is despair,
	Unless I be reliev'd by prayer,
	Which pierces so that it assaults
	Mercy itself and frees all faults.
	As you from crimes would pardon'd be,
	Let your indulgence set me free.
