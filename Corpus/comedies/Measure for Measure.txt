<Scene.—Vienna.>

<ACT 1>


<SCENE 1>
<An Apartment in the Duke's Palace.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Duke, Escalus, Lords, and Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
<DUKE>	<0%>
	Escalus.
</DUKE>

<ESCALUS>	<0%>
	My lord?
</ESCALUS>

<DUKE>	<0%>
	Of government the properties to unfold,
	Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse,
	Since I am put to know that your own science
	Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
	My strength can give you: then no more remains,
	But that, to your sufficiency, as your worth is able,
	And let them work. The nature of our people,
	Our city's institutions, and the terms
	For common justice, you're as pregnant in,
	As art and practice hath enriched any
	That we remember. There is our commission,
<STAGE DIR>
<Giving it.>
</STAGE DIR>
	From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
	I say, bid come before us Angelo.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit an Attendant.>
</STAGE DIR>
	What figure of us think you he will bear?
	For you must know, we have with special soul
	Elected him our absence to supply,
	Lent him our terror, drest him with our love,
	And given his deputation all the organs
	Of our own power: what think you of it?
</DUKE>

<ESCALUS>	<1%>
	If any in Vienna be of worth
	To undergo such ample grace and honour,
	It is Lord Angelo.
</ESCALUS>

<DUKE>	<1%>
	Look where he comes.

</DUKE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Angelo.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ANGELO>	<1%>
	Always obedient to your Grace's will,
	I come to know your pleasure.
</ANGELO>

<DUKE>	<1%>
	Angelo,
	There is a kind of character in thy life,
	That, to th' observer doth thy history
	Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
	Are not thine own so proper, as to waste
	Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
	Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
	Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
	Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
	As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
	But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
	The smallest scruple of her excellence,
	But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
	Herself the glory of a creditor,
	Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
	To one that can my part in him advertise;
	Hold, therefore, Angelo:
<STAGE DIR>
<Tendering his commission.>
</STAGE DIR>
	In our remove be thou at full ourself;
	Mortality and mercy in Vienna
	Live in thy tongue and heart. Old Escalus,
	Though first in question, is thy secondary.
	Take thy commission.
</DUKE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Giving it.>
</STAGE DIR>

<ANGELO>	<2%>
	Now, good my lord,
	Let there be some more test made of my metal,
	Before so noble and so great a figure
	Be stamp'd upon it.
</ANGELO>

<DUKE>	<2%>
	No more evasion:
	We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
	Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
	Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
	That it prefers itself, and leaves unquestion'd
	Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
	As time and our concernings shall importune,
	How it goes with us; and do look to know
	What doth befall you here. So, fare you well:
	To the hopeful execution do I leave you
	Of your commissions.
</DUKE>

<ANGELO>	<2%>
	Yet, give leave, my lord,
	That we may bring you something on the way.
</ANGELO>

<DUKE>	<3%>
	My haste may not admit it;
	Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
	With any scruple: your scope is as mine own,
	So to enforce or qualify the laws
	As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand;
	I'll privily away: I love the people,
	But do not like to stage me to their eyes.
	Though it do well, I do not relish well
	Their loud applause and Aves vehement,
	Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
	That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.
</DUKE>

<ANGELO>	<3%>
	The heavens give safety to your purposes!
</ANGELO>

<ESCALUS>	<3%>
	Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!
</ESCALUS>

<DUKE>	<3%>
	I thank you. Fare you well.
</DUKE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<ESCALUS>	<3%>
	I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
	To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
	To look into the bottom of my place:
	A power I have, but of what strength and nature
	I am not yet instructed.
</ESCALUS>

<ANGELO>	<3%>
	'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
	And we may soon our satisfaction have
	Touching that point.
</ANGELO>

<ESCALUS>	<3%>
	I'll wait upon your honour.
</ESCALUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt.>
</STAGE DIR>

</SCENE 1>


<SCENE 2>
<A Street.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Lucio and two Gentlemen.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LUCIO>	<3%>
	If the Duke with the other dukes come not to composition with the King of Hungary, why then, all the dukes fall upon the king.
</LUCIO>

<GENTLEMAN 1>	<4%>
	Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of Hungary's!
</GENTLEMAN 1>

<GENTLEMAN 2>	<4%>
	Amen.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<LUCIO>	<4%>
	Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped one out of the table.
</LUCIO>

<GENTLEMAN 2>	<4%>
	'Thou shalt not steal?'
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<LUCIO>	<4%>
	Ay, that he razed.
</LUCIO>

<GENTLEMAN 1>	<4%>
	Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and all the rest from their functions: they put forth to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in the thanksgiving before meat, doth relish the petition well that prays for peace.
</GENTLEMAN 1>

<GENTLEMAN 2>	<4%>
	I never heard any soldier dislike it.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<LUCIO>	<4%>
	I believe thee, for I think thou never wast where grace was said.
</LUCIO>

<GENTLEMAN 2>	<4%>
	No? a dozen times at least.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<GENTLEMAN 1>	<4%>
	What, in metre?
</GENTLEMAN 1>

<LUCIO>	<4%>
	In any proportion or in any language.
</LUCIO>

<GENTLEMAN 1>	<4%>
	I think, or in any religion.
</GENTLEMAN 1>

<LUCIO>	<4%>
	Ay; why not? Grace is grace, despite of all controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a wicked villain, despite of all grace.
</LUCIO>

<GENTLEMAN 1>	<4%>
	Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.
</GENTLEMAN 1>

<LUCIO>	<4%>
	I grant; as there may between the lists and the velvet: thou art the list.
</LUCIO>

<GENTLEMAN 1>	<4%>
	And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou art a three-piled piece, I warrant thee. I had as lief be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak feelingly now?
</GENTLEMAN 1>

<LUCIO>	<5%>
	I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I live, forget to drink after thee.
</LUCIO>

<GENTLEMAN 1>	<5%>
	I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?
</GENTLEMAN 1>

<GENTLEMAN 2>	<5%>
	Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<LUCIO>	<5%>
	Behold, behold, where Madam Mitigation comes! I have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to—
</LUCIO>

<GENTLEMAN 2>	<5%>
	To what, I pray?
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<LUCIO>	<5%>
	Judge.
</LUCIO>

<GENTLEMAN 2>	<5%>
	To three thousand dolours a year.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<GENTLEMAN 1>	<5%>
	Ay, and more.
</GENTLEMAN 1>

<LUCIO>	<5%>
	A French crown more.
</LUCIO>

<GENTLEMAN 1>	<5%>
	Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou art full of error: I am sound.
</GENTLEMAN 1>

<LUCIO>	<5%>
	Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow; impiety has made a feast of thee.

</LUCIO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Mistress Overdone.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GENTLEMAN 1>	<5%>
	How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?
</GENTLEMAN 1>

<OVERDONE>	<5%>
	Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all.
</OVERDONE>

<GENTLEMAN 2>	<5%>
	Who's that, I pray thee?
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<OVERDONE>	<5%>
	Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.
</OVERDONE>

<GENTLEMAN 1>	<5%>
	Claudio to prison! 'tis not so.
</GENTLEMAN 1>

<OVERDONE>	<5%>
	Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested; saw him carried away; and, which is more, within these three days his head to be chopped off.
</OVERDONE>

<LUCIO>	<6%>
	But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so. Art thou sure of this?
</LUCIO>

<OVERDONE>	<6%>
	I am too sure of it; and it is for getting Madam Julietta with child.
</OVERDONE>

<LUCIO>	<6%>
	Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two hours since, and he was ever precise in promise-keeping.
</LUCIO>

<GENTLEMAN 2>	<6%>
	Besides, you know, it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purpose.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<GENTLEMAN 1>	<6%>
	But most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.
</GENTLEMAN 1>

<LUCIO>	<6%>
	Away! let's go learn the truth of it.
</LUCIO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Lucio and Gentlemen.>
</STAGE DIR>

<OVERDONE>	<6%>
	Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what with the gallows and what with poverty, I am custom-shrunk.

</OVERDONE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Pompey.>
</STAGE DIR>
	How now! what's the news with you?
<POMPEY>	<6%>
	Yonder man is carried to prison.
</POMPEY>

<OVERDONE>	<6%>
	Well: what has he done?
</OVERDONE>

<POMPEY>	<6%>
	A woman.
</POMPEY>

<OVERDONE>	<6%>
	But what's his offence?
</OVERDONE>

<POMPEY>	<6%>
	Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.
</POMPEY>

<OVERDONE>	<6%>
	What, is there a maid with child by him?
</OVERDONE>

<POMPEY>	<6%>
	No; but there's a woman with maid by him. You have not heard of the proclamation, have you?
</POMPEY>

<OVERDONE>	<6%>
	What proclamation, man?
</OVERDONE>

<POMPEY>	<6%>
	All houses of resort in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down
</POMPEY>

<OVERDONE>	<7%>
	And what shall become of those in the city?
</OVERDONE>

<POMPEY>	<7%>
	They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too, but that a wise burgher put in for them.
</POMPEY>

<OVERDONE>	<7%>
	But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulled down?
</OVERDONE>

<POMPEY>	<7%>
	To the ground, mistress.
</POMPEY>

<OVERDONE>	<7%>
	Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth! What shall become of me?
</OVERDONE>

<POMPEY>	<7%>
	Come; fear not you: good counsellors lack no clients: though you change your place, you need not change your trade; I'll be your tapster still. Courage! there will be pity taken on you; you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you will be considered.
</POMPEY>

<OVERDONE>	<7%>
	What's to do here, Thomas tapster?
	Let's withdraw.
</OVERDONE>

<POMPEY>	<7%>
	Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to prison; and there's Madam Juliet.
</POMPEY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt.>
</STAGE DIR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Provost, Claudio, Juliet, and Officers.>
</STAGE DIR>

<CLAUDIO>	<7%>
	Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?
	Bear me to prison, where I am committed.
</CLAUDIO>

<PROVOST>	<7%>
	I do it not in evil disposition,
	But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
</PROVOST>

<CLAUDIO>	<7%>
	Thus can the demi-god Authority
	Make us pay down for our offence' by weight.
	The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;
	On whom it will not, so: yet still 'tis just.

</CLAUDIO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Lucio and two Gentlemen.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LUCIO>	<8%>
	Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?
</LUCIO>

<CLAUDIO>	<8%>
	From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
	As surfeit is the father of much fast,
	So every scope by the immoderate use
	Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue—
	Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,—
	A thirsty evil, and when we drink we die.
</CLAUDIO>

<LUCIO>	<8%>
	If I could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would send for certain of my creditors. And yet, to say the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy offence, Claudio?
</LUCIO>

<CLAUDIO>	<8%>
	What but to speak of would offend again.
</CLAUDIO>

<LUCIO>	<8%>
	What, is't murder?
</LUCIO>

<CLAUDIO>	<8%>
	No.
</CLAUDIO>

<LUCIO>	<8%>
	Lechery?
</LUCIO>

<CLAUDIO>	<8%>
	Call it so.
</CLAUDIO>

<PROVOST>	<8%>
	Away, sir! you must go.
</PROVOST>

<CLAUDIO>	<8%>
	One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.
</CLAUDIO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Takes him aside.>
</STAGE DIR>

<LUCIO>	<8%>
	A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
	Is lechery so looked after?
</LUCIO>

<CLAUDIO>	<8%>
	Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
	I got possession of Julietta's bed:
	You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
	Save that we do the denunciation lack
	Of outward order: this we came not to,
	Only for propagation of a dower
	Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
	From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
	Till time had made them for us. But it chances
	The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
	With character too gross is writ on Juliet.
</CLAUDIO>

<LUCIO>	<9%>
	With child, perhaps?
</LUCIO>

<CLAUDIO>	<9%>
	Unhappily, even so.
	And the new deputy now for the duke,—
	Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
	Or whether that the body public be
	A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
	Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
	He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
	Whether the tyranny be in his place,
	Or in his eminence that fills it up,
	I stagger in:—but this new governor
	Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
	Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall
	So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round,
	And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
	Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
	Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.
</CLAUDIO>

<LUCIO>	<9%>
	I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to him.
</LUCIO>

<CLAUDIO>	<9%>
	I have done so, but he's not to be found.
	I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service.
	This day my sister should the cloister enter,
	And there receive her approbation:
	Acquaint her with the danger of my state;
	Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
	To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:
	I have great hope in that; for in her youth
	There is a prone and speechless dialect,
	Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
	When she will play with reason and discourse,
	And well she can persuade.
</CLAUDIO>

<LUCIO>	<10%>
	I pray she may: as well for the encouragement of the like, which else would stand under grievous imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of tick-tack. I'll to her.
</LUCIO>

<CLAUDIO>	<10%>
	I thank you, good friend Lucio.
</CLAUDIO>

<LUCIO>	<10%>
	Within two hours.
</LUCIO>

<CLAUDIO>	<10%>
	Come, officer, away!
</CLAUDIO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt.>
</STAGE DIR>

</SCENE 2>


<SCENE 3>
<A Monastery.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Duke and Friar Thomas.>
</STAGE DIR>
<DUKE>	<10%>
	No, holy father; throw away that thought:
	Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
	Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
	To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
	More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
	Of burning youth.
</DUKE>

<FRIAR THOMAS>	<10%>
	May your Grace speak of it?
</FRIAR THOMAS>

<DUKE>	<10%>
	My holy sir, none better knows than you
	How I have ever lov'd the life remov'd,
	And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
	Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
	I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo—
	A man of stricture and firm abstinence—
	My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
	And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
	For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
	And so it is receiv'd. Now, pious sir,
	You will demand of me why I do this?
</DUKE>

<FRIAR THOMAS>	<11%>
	Gladly, my lord.
</FRIAR THOMAS>

<DUKE>	<11%>
	We have strict statutes and most biting laws,—
	The needful bits and curbs to headstrong steeds,—
	Which for this fourteen years we have let sleep;
	Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
	That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
	Having bound up the threat'ning twigs of birch,
	Only to stick it in their children's sight
	For terror, not to use, in time the rod
	Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
	Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead,
	And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
	The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
	Goes all decorum.
</DUKE>

<FRIAR THOMAS>	<11%>
	It rested in your Grace
	T' unloose this tied-up justice when you pleas'd;
	And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
	Than in Lord Angelo.
</FRIAR THOMAS>

<DUKE>	<11%>
	I do fear, too dreadful:
	Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
	'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
	For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,
	When evil deeds have their permissive pass
	And not the punishment. Therefore, indeed, my father,
	I have on Angelo impos'd the office,
	Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,
	And yet my nature never in the sight
	To do it slander. And to behold his sway,
	I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
	Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,
	Supply me with the habit, and instruct me
	How I may formally in person bear me
	Like a true friar. Moe reasons for this action
	At our more leisure shall I render you;
	Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
	Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
	That his blood flows, or that his appetite
	Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,
	If power change purpose, what our seemers be.
</DUKE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt.>

</SCENE 3>


<SCENE 4>
<A Nunnery.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Isabella and Francisca.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ISABELLA>	<12%>
	And have you nuns no further privileges?
</ISABELLA>

<FRANCISCA>	<12%>
	Are not these large enough?
</FRANCISCA>

<ISABELLA>	<12%>
	Yes, truly: I speak not as desiring more,
	But rather wishing a more strict restraint
	Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.
</ISABELLA>

<LUCIO>	<12%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Within.>
</STAGE DIR> Ho! Peace be in this place!
</LUCIO>

<ISABELLA>	<12%>
	Who's that which calls?
</ISABELLA>

<FRANCISCA>	<12%>
	It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
	Turn you the key, and know his business of him:
	You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.
	When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men
	But in the presence of the prioress:
	Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
	Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
	He calls again; I pray you, answer him.
</FRANCISCA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<ISABELLA>	<13%>
	Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls?

</ISABELLA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Lucio.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LUCIO>	<13%>
	Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
	Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me
	As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
	A novice of this place, and the fair sister
	To her unhappy brother Claudio?
</LUCIO>

<ISABELLA>	<13%>
	Why 'her unhappy brother?' let me ask;
	The rather for I now must make you know
	I am that Isabella and his sister.
</ISABELLA>

<LUCIO>	<13%>
	Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:
	Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.
</LUCIO>

<ISABELLA>	<13%>
	Woe me! for what?
</ISABELLA>

<LUCIO>	<13%>
	For that which, if myself might be his judge,
	He should receive his punishment in thanks:
	He hath got his friend with child.
</LUCIO>

<ISABELLA>	<13%>
	Sir, make me not your story.
</ISABELLA>

<LUCIO>	<13%>
	It is true.
	I would not, though 'tis my familiar sin
	With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
	Tongue far from heart, play with all virgins so:
	I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted;
	By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
	And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
	As with a saint.
</LUCIO>

<ISABELLA>	<13%>
	You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.
</ISABELLA>

<LUCIO>	<13%>
	Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
	Your brother and his lover have embrac'd:
	As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
	That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
	To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
	Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.
</LUCIO>

<ISABELLA>	<14%>

</ISABELLA>

<LUCIO>	<14%>
	Is she your cousin?
</LUCIO>

<ISABELLA>	<14%>
	Adoptedly; asschool-maids change their names

</ISABELLA>

<LUCIO>	<14%>
	She it is.
</LUCIO>

<ISABELLA>	<14%>
	O! let him marry her.
</ISABELLA>

<LUCIO>	<14%>
	This is the point.
	The duke is very strangely gone from hence;
	Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
	In hand and hope of action; but we do learn
	By those that know the very nerves of state,
	His givings out were of an infinite distance
	From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
	And with full line of his authority,
	Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
	Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
	The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
	But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
	With profits of the mind, study and fast.
	He,—to give fear to use and liberty,
	Which have for long run by the hideous law,
	As mice by lions, hath pick'd out an act,
	Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
	Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it,
	And follows close the rigour of the statute,
	To make him an example. All hope is gone,
	Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
	To soften Angelo; and that's my pith of business
	Twixt you and your poor brother.
</LUCIO>

<ISABELLA>	<14%>
	Doth he so seek his life?
</ISABELLA>

<LUCIO>	<14%>
	He's censur'd him
	Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath
	A warrant for his execution.
</LUCIO>

<ISABELLA>	<15%>
	Alas! what poor ability's in me
	To do him good?
</ISABELLA>

<LUCIO>	<15%>
	Assay the power you have.
</LUCIO>

<ISABELLA>	<15%>
	My power? alas! I doubt—
</ISABELLA>

<LUCIO>	<15%>
	Our doubts are traitors,
	And make us lose the good we oft might win,
	By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
	And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
	Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
	All their petitions are as freely theirs
	As they themselves would owe them.
</LUCIO>

<ISABELLA>	<15%>
	I'll see what I can do.
</ISABELLA>

<LUCIO>	<15%>
	But speedily.
</LUCIO>

<ISABELLA>	<15%>
	I will about it straight;
	No longer staying but to give the Mother
	Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:
	Commend me to my brother; soon at night
	I'll send him certain word of my success.
</ISABELLA>

<LUCIO>	<15%>

<ANGELO>	<15%>
	We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
	Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,

</ANGELO>

<ESCALUS>	<15%>
	Ay, but yet
	Let us be keen and rather cut a little,
	Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas! this gentleman,
	Whom I would save, had a most noble father.
	Let but your honour know,—
	Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,—
	That, in the working of your own affections,
	Had time coher'd with place or place with wishing,
	Or that the resolute acting of your blood
	Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,
	Whether you had not, some time in your life,
	Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
	And pull'd the law upon you.
</ESCALUS>

<ANGELO>	<16%>
	'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
	Another thing to fall. I not deny,
	The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
	May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
	Guiltier than him they try; what's open made to justice,
	That justice seizes: what know the laws
	That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
	The jewel that we find, we stoop and take it
	Because we see it; but what we do not see
	We tread upon, and never think of it.
	You may not so extenuate his offence
	For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
	When I, that censure him, do so offend,
	Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
	And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.

	This comes off well: here's a wise officer.

</POMPEY>

<ANGELO>	<17%>
	What are you, sir?
</ANGELO>

<ELBOW>	<17%>
	He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that serves a bad woman, whose house, sir, was, as they say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.
</ELBOW>

<ESCALUS>	<18%>
	How know you that?

<ELBOW>	<18%>
	Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,—
</ELBOW>

<ESCALUS>	<18%>
	Dost thou detest her therefore?
</ESCALUS>

<ELBOW>	<18%>
	I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house, it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.
</ELBOW>

<ESCALUS>	<18%>
	How dost thou know that, constable?
</ESCALUS>

<ELBOW>	<18%>
	Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman cardinally given, might have been accused in fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.
</ELBOW>

<ESCALUS>	<18%>
	By the woman's means?
</ESCALUS>

<POMPEY>	<18%>
	Sir, she came in, great with child, and longing,—saving your honour's reverence,—for stewed prunes. Sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very good dishes.
</POMPEY>

<ESCALUS>	<19%>
	Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.
</ESCALUS>

<POMPEY>	<19%>
	No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in the right: but to the point. As I say, this Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for prunes, and having but two in the dish, as I said, Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could not give you three-pence again.
</POMPEY>

<FROTH>	<19%>
	No, indeed.
</FROTH>

<POMPEY>	<19%>
	Very well: you being then, if you be remembered, cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,—
</POMPEY>

<FROTH>	<19%>
	Ay, so I did, indeed.
</FROTH>

<POMPEY>	<19%>
	Why, very well: I telling you then, if you be remembered, that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very good diet, as I told you,—
</POMPEY>

<FROTH>	<19%>
	All this is true.

	Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.

	No, sir, nor I mean it not.

<POMPEY>	<19%>
	Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth here, sir; a man of fourscore pound a year, whose father died at Hallowmas. Was't not at Hallowmas, Master Froth?
</POMPEY>

<FROTH>	<20%>
	All-hallownd eve.
</FROTH>

<POMPEY>	<20%>
	Why, very well: I hope here be truths. He, sir, sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed, you have a delight to sit, have you not?
</POMPEY>

<FROTH>	<20%>
	I have so, because it is an open room and good for winter.
</FROTH>

	Why, very well then: I hope here be truths.

	Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?
</ESCALUS>

<POMPEY>	<20%>
	Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.
</POMPEY>

<ELBOW>	<20%>
	I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.
</ELBOW>

<POMPEY>	<20%>
	I beseech your honour, ask me.

<ESCALUS>	<20%>
	Well, sir, what did this gentleman to her?
</ESCALUS>

<POMPEY>	<20%>
	I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face. Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?
</POMPEY>

<ESCALUS>	<20%>
	Ay, sir, very well.
</ESCALUS>

<POMPEY>	<20%>
	Nay, I beseech you, mark it well.

<ESCALUS>	<20%>
	Well, I do so.

<POMPEY>	<21%>
	Doth your honour see any harm in his face?
</POMPEY>

<ESCALUS>	<21%>
	Why, no.
</ESCALUS>

<POMPEY>	<21%>
	I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the constable's wife any harm? I would know that of your honour.
</POMPEY>

<ESCALUS>	<21%>
	He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?
</ESCALUS>

<ELBOW>	<21%>
	First, an' it like you, the house is a respected house; next, this is a respected fellow, and his mistress is a respected woman.
</ELBOW>

<POMPEY>	<21%>
	By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than any of us all.
</POMPEY>

<ELBOW>	<21%>
	Varlet, thou liest: thou liest, wicked varlet. The time is yet to come that she was ever respected with man, woman, or child.
</ELBOW>

	Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.
</POMPEY>

	Which is the wiser here? Justice, or Iniquity? Is this true?
</ESCALUS>

<ELBOW>	<21%>
	O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married to her? If ever I was respected with her, or she with me, let not your worship think me the poor duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or I'll have mine action of battery on thee.
</ELBOW>

<ESCALUS>	<21%>
	If he took you a box o' th' ear, you might have your action of slander too.

	Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?
</ELBOW>

	Nine!—Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master Froth, I would not have you acquainted with tapsters; they will draw you, Master Froth, and you will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no more of you.

	Bum, sir.
</POMPEY>

<ESCALUS>	<23%>
	Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you, so that, in the beastliest sense, you are Pompey the Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey, howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.
</ESCALUS>

<POMPEY>	<23%>
	Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.
</POMPEY>

<ESCALUS>	<23%>
	How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?
</ESCALUS>

<POMPEY>	<23%>
	If the law would allow it, sir.
</POMPEY>

<ESCALUS>	<23%>
	But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall not be allowed in Vienna.
</ESCALUS>

<POMPEY>	<23%>
	Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of the city?
</POMPEY>

<ESCALUS>	<23%>
	No, Pompey.
</ESCALUS>

<POMPEY>	<23%>
	Truly, sir, in my humble opinion, they will to't then. If your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.
</POMPEY>

<ESCALUS>	<23%>
	There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you: it is but heading and hanging.
</ESCALUS>

<POMPEY>	<23%>
	If you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a commission for more heads. If this law hold in Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it after threepence a bay. If you live to see this come to pass, say, Pompey told you so.
</POMPEY>

<ESCALUS>	<23%>
	Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever; no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey, I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd Cæsar to you. In plain dealing, Pompey, I shall have you whipt. So, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.

	There is a vice that most I do abhor,

</ANGELO>

<ISABELLA>	<28%>
	To-morrow! O! that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!
	He's not prepar'd for death. Even for our kitchens
	We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven
	With less respect than we do minister
	To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you:

</STAGE DIR> Ay, well said.

<ANGELO>	<29%>
	The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
	Those many had not dar'd to do that evil,
	If that the first that did th' edict infringe
	Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake,
	Takes note of what is done, and, like a prophet,
	Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,
	Either new, or by remissness new-conceiv'd,
	And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,
	Are now to have no successive degrees,
	But, ere they live, to end.
</ANGELO>

<ISABELLA>	<29%>
	Yet show some pity.
</ISABELLA>

<ANGELO>	<29%>
	I show it most of all when I show justice;
	For then I pity those I do not know,

	Lives not to act another. Be satisfied:
	Your brother dies to-morrow: be content.
</ANGELO>

<ISABELLA>	<29%>
	So you must be the first that gives this sentence,

	That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
	Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
	That's like my brother's fault: if it confess

	Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
	Against my brother's life.

	Ha!
	Not she; nor doth she tempt: but it is I,
	That, lying by the violet in the sun,
	Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
	Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
	That modesty may more betray our sense
	Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
	Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary,
	And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
	What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
	Dost thou desire her foully for those things
	That make her good? O, let her brother live!
	Thieves for their robbery have authority
	When judges steal themselves. What! do I love her,
	That I desire to hear her speak again,
	And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
	O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
	With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
	Is that temptation that doth goad us on
	To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
	With all her double vigour, art and nature,
	Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
	Subdues me quite. Ever till now,
	When men were fond, I smil'd and wonder'd how.

	And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
	Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied,
	Is like a good thing, being often read,
	Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,
	Wherein, let no man hear me, I take pride,
	Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
	Which the air beats for vain. O place! O form!
	How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,

	Come all to help him, and so stop the air

	Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness

	Sir, believe this,

	Please you to do't,

	Pleas'd you to do't, at peril of your soul,
	Were equal poise of sin and charity.
</ANGELO>

<ISABELLA>	<37%>
	That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
	Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,
	If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
	To have it added to the faults of mine,
	And nothing of your answer.
</ISABELLA>

<ANGELO>	<37%>
	Nay, but hear me.
	Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,
	Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.

	Your brother is to die.
</ANGELO>

	Admit no other way to save his life,—

	Finding yourself desir'd of such a person,
	Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
	Could fetch your brother from the manacles
	Of the all-building law; and that there were
	No earthly mean to save him, but that either
	You must lay down the treasures of your body
	To this suppos'd, or else to let him suffer;
	What would you do?
</ANGELO>

<ISABELLA>	<38%>
	As much for my poor brother, as myself:
	That is, were I under the terms of death,
	Th' impression of keen whips I'd wear as rubies,

	That, longing, have been sick for, ere I'd yield

	Then must your brother die.

	Than faults may shake our frames,—let me be bold;
	I do arrest your words. Be that you are,

	Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud
	What man thou art.
</ISABELLA>

<ANGELO>	<39%>
	Who will believe thee, Isabel?
	My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,
	My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,
	Will so your accusation overweigh,
	That you shall stifle in your own report
	And smell of calumny. I have begun;
	And now I give my sensual race the rein:
	Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
	Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
	That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother
	By yielding up thy body to my will,
	Or else he must not only die the death,
	But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
	To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
	Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
	I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
	Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.

	Either of condemnation or approof,
	Bidding the law make curt'sy to their will;
	Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite,
	To follow as it draws. I'll to my brother:
	Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,
	Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour,
	That, had he twenty heads to tender down
	On twenty bloody blocks, he'd yield them up,
	Before his sister should her body stoop
	To such abhorr'd pollution.
	Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
	More than our brother is our chastity.
	I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
	And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.

</CLAUDIO>

<DUKE>	<41%>
	Be absolute for death; either death or life
	Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
	If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
	That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,
	Servile to all the skyey influences,
	That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,
	Hourly afflict. Merely, thou art death's fool;
	For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun,
	And yet run'st toward him still. Thou art not noble:
	For all th' accommodations that thou bear'st
	Are nurs'd by baseness. Thou art by no means valiant;
	For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
	Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
	And that thou oft provok'st; yet grossly fear'st
	Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
	For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
	That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
	For what thou hast not, still thou striv'st to get,
	And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
	For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
	After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
	For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
	Thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey,
	And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
	For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
	The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
	Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
	For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age;
	But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
	Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
	Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
	Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
	Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
	To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
	That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
	Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
	That makes these odds all even.

<CLAUDIO>	<43%>
	But is there any?
</CLAUDIO>

<ISABELLA>	<43%>
	Yes, brother, you may live:

</ISABELLA>

<CLAUDIO>	<43%>
	Perpetual durance?
</CLAUDIO>

<ISABELLA>	<43%>

	To a determin'd scope.
</ISABELLA>

	But in what nature?
</CLAUDIO>

	Let me know the point.
</CLAUDIO>

<ISABELLA>	<43%>
	O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
	Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
	And six or seven winters more respect
	Than a perpetual honour. Dar'st thou die?
	The sense of death is most in apprehension,
	And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
	In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
	As when a giant dies.
</ISABELLA>

<CLAUDIO>	<44%>
	Why give you me this shame?
	Think you I can a resolution fetch
	From flowery tenderness? If I must die,
	I will encounter darkness as a bride,
	And hug it in mine arms.
</CLAUDIO>

<ISABELLA>	<44%>
	There spake my brother: there my father's grave
	Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
	Thou art too noble to conserve a life
	In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
	Whose settled visage and deliberate word
	Nips youth i' the head, and follies doth enmew
	As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil;
	His filth within being cast, he would appear
	A pond as deep as hell.
</ISABELLA>

<CLAUDIO>	<44%>

</CLAUDIO>

<ISABELLA>	<44%>
	O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,

	O heavens! it cannot be.
</CLAUDIO>

<ISABELLA>	<44%>
	Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,

<CLAUDIO>	<44%>
	Thou shalt not do't.

<CLAUDIO>	<45%>

	When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin;
	Or of the deadly seven it is the least.
</CLAUDIO>

<ISABELLA>	<45%>
	Which is the least?
</ISABELLA>

<CLAUDIO>	<45%>

	What says my brother?
</ISABELLA>

<CLAUDIO>	<45%>
	Death is a fearful thing.
</CLAUDIO>

	And shamed life a hateful.
</ISABELLA>

<CLAUDIO>	<45%>
	Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
	To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
	This sensible warm motion to become
	A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
	To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
	In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
	To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
	And blown with restless violence round about
	The pendant world; or to be worse than worst
	Of those that lawless and incertain thoughts
	Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!
	The weariest and most loathed worldly life
	That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
	Can lay on nature is a paradise
	To what we fear of death.
</CLAUDIO>

<ISABELLA>	<45%>
	Alas! alas!
</ISABELLA>

<CLAUDIO>	<45%>
	Sweet sister, let me live:
	What sin you do to save a brother's life,
	Nature dispenses with the deed so far
	That it becomes a virtue.
</CLAUDIO>

<ISABELLA>	<45%>
	O you beast!
	O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
	Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
	Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
	From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
	Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair;
	For such a warped slip of wilderness
	Ne'er issu'd from his blood. Take my defiance;
	Die, perish! Might but my bending down
	Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed.
	I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
	No word to save thee.
</ISABELLA>

<CLAUDIO>	<46%>
	Nay, hear me, Isabel.
</CLAUDIO>

<ISABELLA>	<46%>

<Aside to Claudio.>
</STAGE DIR> Son, I have overheard what hath past between you and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her; only he hath made an assay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition of natures. She, having the truth of honour in her, hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive: I am confessor to Angelo, and I know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to death. Do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible: to-morrow you must die; go to your knees and make ready.
</DUKE>

<CLAUDIO>	<47%>
	Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love with life that I will sue to be rid of it.
</CLAUDIO>

<DUKE>	<47%>
	Hold you there: farewell.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Claudio.>

</DUKE>

<Re-enter Provost.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Provost, a word with you.
<PROVOST>	<47%>
	What's your will, father?
</PROVOST>

<DUKE>	<47%>
	That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company.

<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>

<DUKE>	<47%>
	The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good: the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you, fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should wonder at Angelo. How would you do to content this substitute, and to save your brother?
</DUKE>

<ISABELLA>	<47%>
	I am now going to resolve him; I had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born. But O, how much is the good duke deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can speak to him. I will open my lips in vain, or discover his government.
</ISABELLA>

<DUKE>	<48%>
	That shall not be much amiss: yet, as the matter now stands, he will avoid your accusation; 'he made trial of you only.' Therefore, fasten your ear on my advisings: to the love I have in doing good a remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit, redeem your brother from the angry law, do no stain to your own gracious person, and much please the absent duke, if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business.
</DUKE>

<ISABELLA>	<48%>
	Let me hear you speak further. I have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.
</ISABELLA>

<DUKE>	<48%>
	Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of Frederick, the great soldier who miscarried at sea?
</DUKE>

<ISABELLA>	<48%>
	I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.
</ISABELLA>

<DUKE>	<48%>
	She should this Angelo have married; was affianced to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between which time of the contract, and limit of the solemnity, her brother Frederick was wracked at sea, having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most kind and natural; with him the portion and sinew of her fortune, her marriage-dowry with both, her combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.
</DUKE>

<ISABELLA>	<49%>
	Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?
</ISABELLA>

<DUKE>	<49%>
	Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole, pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few, bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, is washed with them, but relents not.
</DUKE>

<ISABELLA>	<49%>
	What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world! What corruption in this life, that it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?
</ISABELLA>

<DUKE>	<49%>
	It is a rupture that you may easily heal; and the cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps you from dishonour in doing it.
</DUKE>

<ISABELLA>	<49%>
	Show me how, good father.
</ISABELLA>

<DUKE>	<49%>
	This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that in all reason should have quenched her love, hath, like an impediment in the current, made it more violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo: answer his requiring with a plausible obedience: agree with his demands to the point; only refer yourself to this advantage, first, that your stay with him may not be long, that the time may have all shadow and silence in it, and the place answer to convenience. This being granted in course, and now follows all, we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to her recompense; and here by this is your brother saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you think well to carry this, as you may, the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof. What think you of it?
</DUKE>

<ISABELLA>	<50%>
	The image of it gives me content already, and I trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.
</ISABELLA>

<DUKE>	<50%>
	It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will presently to St. Luke's; there, at the moated grange, resides this dejected Mariana: at that place call upon me, and dispatch with Angelo, that it may be quickly.

</STAGE DIR>
	What news, friar, of the duke?
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<53%>
	I know none. Can you tell me of any?
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<54%>
	Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<54%>
	I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<54%>
	It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he puts transgression to't.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<54%>
	He does well in't.
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<54%>
	A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him: something too crabbed that way, friar.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<54%>
	It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<54%>
	Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is well allied; but it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation: is it true, think you?
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<54%>
	How should he be made, then?
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<54%>
	Some report a sea-maid spawn'd him; some that he was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congealed ice; that I know to be true; and he is a motion generative; that's infallible.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<54%>
	You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<54%>
	Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion of a cod-piece to take away the life of a man! Would the duke that is absent have done this? Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport; he knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<55%>
	I never heard the absent duke much detected for women; he was not inclined that way.
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<55%>
	O, sir, you are deceived.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<55%>
	'Tis not possible.
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<55%>
	Who? not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty, and his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish; the duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too; that let me inform you.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<55%>
	You do him wrong, surely.
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<55%>
	Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the duke; and, I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<55%>
	What, I prithee, might be the cause?
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<55%>
	No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips; but this I can let you understand, the greater file of the subject held the duke to be wise.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<55%>
	Wise! why, no question but he was.
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<55%>
	A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<55%>
	Either this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking: the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must, upon a warranted need, give him a better proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own bringings forth, and he shall appear to the envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier. Therefore you speak unskilfully; or, if your knowledge be more, it is much darkened in your malice.
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<56%>
	Sir, I know him, and I love him.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<56%>
	Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer love.
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<56%>
	Come, sir, I know what I know.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<56%>
	I can hardly believe that, since you know not what you speak. But, if ever the duke return,—as our prayers are he may,—let me desire you to make your answer before him: if it be honest you have spoke, you have courage to maintain it. I am bound to call upon you; and, I pray you, your name?
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<56%>
	Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the duke.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<56%>
	He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to report you.
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<56%>
	I fear you not.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<56%>
	O! you hope the duke will return no more, or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<56%>
	I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me, friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if Claudio die to-morrow or no?
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<56%>
	Why should he die, sir?
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<56%>
	Why? for filling a bottle with a tundish. I would the duke we talk of were returned again: this ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with continency; sparrows must not build in his house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would never bring them to light: would he were returned! Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing. Farewell, good friar; I prithee, pray for me. The duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee, he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.

	My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me. Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the duke's time; he promised her marriage; his child is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob: I have kept it myself, and see how he goes about to abuse me!

	What news abroad i' the world?
</ESCALUS>

<DUKE>	<58%>
	None, but there is so great a fever on goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it: novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking: there is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure, but security enough to make fellowships accursed. Much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?
</DUKE>

<ESCALUS>	<59%>
	One that, above all other strifes, contended especially to know himself.
</ESCALUS>

<DUKE>	<59%>
	What pleasure was he given to?
</DUKE>

<ESCALUS>	<59%>
	Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at anything which professed to make him rejoice: a gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous; and let me desire to know how you find Claudio prepared. I am made to understand, that you have lent him visitation.
</ESCALUS>

<DUKE>	<59%>
	He professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice; yet had he framed to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many deceiving promises of life, which I, by my good leisure have discredited to him, and now is he resolved to die.
</DUKE>

<ESCALUS>	<59%>
	You have paid the heavens your function, and the prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty; but my brother justice have I found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him he is indeed Justice.
</ESCALUS>

<DUKE>	<59%>
	If his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.
</DUKE>

<ESCALUS>	<59%>
	I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.

	Shame to him whose cruel striking
	Kills for faults of his own liking!
	Twice treble shame on Angelo,
	To weed my vice and let his grow!
	O, what may man within him hide,
	Though angel on the outward side!
	How many likeness made in crimes,
	Making practice on the times,
	To draw with idle spiders' strings
	Most pond'rous and substantial things!
	Craft against vice I must apply:
	With Angelo to-night shall lie
	His old betrothed but despis'd:
	So disguise shall, by the disguis'd,
	Pay with falsehood false exacting,
	And perform an old contracting.

	Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio and Barnardine.

	For which the pardoner himself is in;
	Hence hath offence his quick celerity,
	When it is borne in high authority.
	When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,
	That for the fault's love is the offender friended.
	Now, sir, what news?
</DUKE>

<PROVOST>	<68%>
	I told you; Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted putting on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.
</PROVOST>

<DUKE>	<68%>
	Pray you, let's hear.
</DUKE>

<PROVOST>	<68%>
	Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let Claudio be executed by four of the clock; and, in the afternoon, Barnardine. For my better satisfaction, let me have Claudio's head sent me by five. Let this be duly performed; with a thought that more depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail not to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.
	What say you to this, sir?
</PROVOST>

<DUKE>	<68%>
	What is that Barnardine who is to be executed this afternoon?
</DUKE>

<PROVOST>	<68%>
	A Bohemian born, but here nursed up and bred; one that is a prisoner nine years old.
</PROVOST>

<DUKE>	<68%>
	How came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I have heard it was ever his manner to do so.
</DUKE>

<PROVOST>	<68%>
	His friends still wrought reprieves for him; and, indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.
</PROVOST>

<DUKE>	<68%>
	It is now apparent?
</DUKE>

<PROVOST>	<68%>
	Most manifest, and not denied by himself.
</PROVOST>

<DUKE>	<68%>
	Hath he borne himself penitently in prison? How seems he to be touched?
</DUKE>

<PROVOST>	<68%>
	A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of mortality, and desperately mortal.
</PROVOST>

<DUKE>	<69%>
	He wants advice.
</DUKE>

<PROVOST>	<69%>
	He will hear none. He hath evermore had the liberty of the prison: give him leave to escape hence, he would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.
</PROVOST>

<DUKE>	<69%>
	More of him anon. There is written in your brow, provost, honesty and constancy; if I read it not truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the boldness of my cunning I will lay myself in hazard. Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is no greater forfeit to the law than Angalo who hath sentenced him. To make you understand this in a manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite, for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy.
</DUKE>

<PROVOST>	<69%>
	Pray, sir, in what?
</PROVOST>

<DUKE>	<69%>
	In the delaying death.
</DUKE>

<PROVOST>	<69%>
	Alack! how may I do it, having the hour limited, and an express command, under penalty, to deliver his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case as Claudio's to cross this in the smallest.
</PROVOST>

<DUKE>	<69%>
	By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine be this morning executed, and his head borne to Angelo.
</DUKE>

<PROVOST>	<70%>
	Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.
</PROVOST>

<DUKE>	<70%>
	O! death's a great disguiser, and you may add to it. Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death: you know the course is common. If anything fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead against it with my life.
</DUKE>

<PROVOST>	<70%>
	Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.
</PROVOST>

<DUKE>	<70%>
	Were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy?
</DUKE>

<PROVOST>	<70%>
	To him, and to his substitutes.
</PROVOST>

<DUKE>	<70%>
	You will think you have made no offence, if the duke avouch the justice of your dealing?
</DUKE>

<PROVOST>	<70%>
	But what likelihood is in that?
</PROVOST>

<DUKE>	<70%>
	Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you. Look you, sir; here is the hand and seal of the duke: you know the character, I doubt not, and the signet is not strange to you.
</DUKE>

<PROVOST>	<70%>
	I know them both.
</PROVOST>

<DUKE>	<70%>
	The contents of this is the return of the duke: you shall anon over-read if at your pleasure, where you shall find within these two days, he will be here. This is a thing that Angelo knows not, for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour; perchance of the duke's death; perchance, his entering into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these things should be: all difficulties are but easy when they are known. Call your executioner, and off with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you are amaz'd, but this shall absolutely resolve you. Come away; it is almost clear dawn.

First, here's young Master Rash; he's in for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger, nine-score and seventeen pounds, of which he made five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not much in request, for the old women were all dead. Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of peach-colour'd satin, which now peaches him a beggar. Then have we young Dizy, and young Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young Drop-heir that kill'd lusty Pudding, and Master Forthlight, the tilter, and brave Master Shoe-tie the great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed Pots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in our trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'

<PROVOST>	<74%>
	Here in the prison, father,
	There died this morning of a cruel fever

<ISABELLA>	<82%>
	O worthy duke!
	You bid me seek redemption of the devil.
	Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
	Must either punish me, not being believ'd,
	Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O, hear me, here!
</ISABELLA>

<ANGELO>	<82%>
	My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:
	She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
	Cut off by course of justice,—
</ANGELO>

<ISABELLA>	<82%>
	By course of justice!
</ISABELLA>

<ANGELO>	<82%>
	And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
</ANGELO>

<ISABELLA>	<82%>
	Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak.
	That Angelo's forsworn, is it not strange?
	That Angelo's a murderer, is't not strange?
	That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
	A hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
	Is it not strange, and strange?
</ISABELLA>

<DUKE>	<82%>
	Nay, it is ten times strange.
</DUKE>

<ISABELLA>	<82%>
	It is not truer he is Angelo
	Than this is all as true as it is strange;
	Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
	To the end of reckoning.
</ISABELLA>

<DUKE>	<82%>
	Away with her! poor soul,
	She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.
</DUKE>

<ISABELLA>	<82%>
	O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believ'st
	There is another comfort than this world,
	That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
	That I am touch'd with madness. Make not impossible
	That which but seems unlike. 'Tis not impossible
	But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
	May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
	As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
	In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
	Be an arch-villain. Believe it, royal prince:
	If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
	Had I more name for badness.
</ISABELLA>

<DUKE>	<83%>
	By mine honesty,
	If she be mad,—as I believe no other,—
	Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
	Such a dependency of thing on thing,
	As e'er I heard in madness.
</DUKE>

<ISABELLA>	<83%>
	O gracious duke!
	Harp not on that; nor do not banish reason
	For inequality; but let your reason serve
	To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
	And hide the false seems true.
</ISABELLA>

<DUKE>	<83%>
	Many that are not mad
	Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?
</DUKE>

<ISABELLA>	<83%>
	I am the sister of one Claudio,
	Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
	To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo.
	I, in probation of a sisterhood,
	Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
	As then the messenger,—
</ISABELLA>

<LUCIO>	<83%>
	That's I, an't like your Grace:
	I came to her from Claudio, and desir'd her
	To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
	For her poor brother's pardon.
</LUCIO>

<ISABELLA>	<83%>
	That's he indeed.
</ISABELLA>

<DUKE>	<83%>
	You were not bid to speak.
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<83%>
	No, my good lord;
	Nor wish'd to hold my peace.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<83%>
	I wish you now, then;
	Pray you, take note of it; and when you have
	A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
	Be perfect.
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<83%>
	I warrant your honour.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<84%>
	The warrant's for yourself: take heed to it.

<ISABELLA>	<84%>
	This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,—
</ISABELLA>

<LUCIO>	<84%>
	Right.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<84%>
	It may be right; but you are in the wrong
	To speak before your time. Proceed.
</DUKE>

<ISABELLA>	<84%>
	I went
	To this pernicious caitiff deputy.
</ISABELLA>

<DUKE>	<84%>
	That's somewhat madly spoken.
</DUKE>

<ISABELLA>	<84%>
	Pardon it;
	The phrase is to the matter.
</ISABELLA>

<DUKE>	<84%>
	Mended again: the matter; proceed.
</DUKE>

<ISABELLA>	<84%>
	In brief, to set the needless process by,
	How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
	How he refell'd me, and how I replied,—
	For this was of much length,—the vile conclusion
	I now begin with grief and shame to utter.
	He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
	To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
	Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
	My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
	And I did yield to him. But the next morn betimes,
	His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
	For my poor brother's head.
</ISABELLA>

<DUKE>	<84%>
	This is most likely!
</DUKE>

<ISABELLA>	<84%>
	O, that it were as like as it is true!
</ISABELLA>

<DUKE>	<84%>
	By heaven, fond wretch! thou know'st not what thou speak'st,
	Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
	In hateful practice. First, his integrity
	Stands without blemish; next, it imports no reason
	That with such vehemency he should pursue
	Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,
	He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself,
	And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:
	Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
	Thou cam'st here to complain.
</DUKE>

<ISABELLA>	<85%>
	And is this all?
	Then, O you blessed ministers above,
	Keep me in patience; and, with ripen'd time
	Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
	In countenance! Heaven shield your Grace from woe,
	As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!
</ISABELLA>

<DUKE>	<85%>
	I know you'd fain be gone. An officer!
	To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
	A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
	On him so near us? This needs must be a practice.
	Who knew of your intent and coming hither?
</DUKE>

<ISABELLA>	<85%>
	One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.
</ISABELLA>

<DUKE>	<85%>
	A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<85%>
	My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
	I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord,
	For certain words he spake against your Grace
	In your retirement, I had swing'd him soundly.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<85%>
	Words against me! This' a good friar, belike!
	And to set on this wretched woman here
	Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<85%>
	But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
	I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,
	A very scurvy fellow.
</LUCIO>

<FRIAR PETER>	<85%>
	Bless'd be your royal Grace!
	I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
	Your royal ear abus'd. First, hath this woman
	Most wrongfully accus'd your substitute,
	Who is as free from touch or soil with her,
	As she from one ungot.
</FRIAR PETER>

<DUKE>	<86%>
	We did believe no less.
	Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?
</DUKE>

<FRIAR PETER>	<86%>
	I know him for a man divine and holy;
	Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
	As he's reported by this gentleman;
	And, on my trust, a man that never yet
	Did, as he vouches, misreport your Grace.
</FRIAR PETER>

<LUCIO>	<86%>
	My lord, most villanously; believe it.
</LUCIO>

<FRIAR PETER>	<86%>
	Well; he in time may come to clear himself,
	But at this instant he is sick, my lord,
	Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,
	Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
	Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,
	To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
	Is true and false; and what he with his oath
	And all probation will make up full clear,
	Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman,
	To justify this worthy nobleman,
	So vulgarly and personally accus'd,
	Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
	Till she herself confess it.
</FRIAR PETER>

<DUKE>	<86%>
	Good friar, let's hear it.
<STAGE DIR>
<Isabella is carried off guarded; and Mariana comes forward.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?—
	O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
	Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;
	In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
	Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?
	First, let her show her face, and after speak.
</DUKE>

<MARIANA>	<87%>
	Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face
	Until my husband bid me.
</MARIANA>

<DUKE>	<87%>

</DUKE>

<MARIANA>	<87%>
	No, my lord.

</DUKE>

<MARIANA>	<87%>
	Neither, my lord.
</MARIANA>

<DUKE>	<87%>
	Why, you
	Are nothing, then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<87%>
	My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are neither maid, widow, nor wife.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<87%>
	Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause
	To prattle for himself.
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<87%>
	Well, my lord.
</LUCIO>

<MARIANA>	<87%>
	My lord, I do confess I ne'er was married;
	And I confess besides I am no maid:
	I have known my husband yet my husband knows not
	That ever he knew me.
</MARIANA>

<LUCIO>	<87%>
	He was drunk then my lord: it can be no better.
</LUCIO>

	For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<87%>
	Well, my lord.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<87%>
	This is no witness for Lord Angelo.
</DUKE>

<MARIANA>	<87%>
	Now I come to't, my lord:
	She that accuses him of fornication,
	In self-same manner doth accuse my husband;
	And charges him, my lord, with such a time,
	When, I'll depose, I had him in mine arms,
	With all th' effect of love.
</MARIANA>

<ANGELO>	<87%>
	Charges she moe than me?
</ANGELO>

<MARIANA>	<87%>
	Not that I know.
</MARIANA>

<DUKE>	<87%>
	No? you say your husband.
</DUKE>

<MARIANA>	<88%>
	Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
	Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body
	But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.
</MARIANA>

<ANGELO>	<88%>
	This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
</ANGELO>

	My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
<STAGE DIR>
<Unveiling.>
</STAGE DIR>
	This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
	Which once thou swor'st was worth the looking on:
	This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
	Was fast belock'd in thine: this is the body
	That took away the match from Isabel,
	And did supply thee at thy garden-house
	In her imagin'd person.
</MARIANA>

<DUKE>	<88%>
	Know you this woman?

<LUCIO>	<88%>
	Enough, my lord.
</LUCIO>

<ANGELO>	<88%>
	My lord, I must confess I know this woman;
	And five years since there was some speech of marriage
	Betwixt myself and her, which was broke off,
	Partly for that her promised proportions
	Came short of composition; but, in chief
	For that her reputation was disvalu'd
	In levity: since which time of five years
	I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
	Upon my faith and honour.
</ANGELO>

<MARIANA>	<88%>
	Noble prince,
	As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
	As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
	I am affianc'd this man's wife as strongly
	As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,
	But Tuesday night last gone in 's garden-house
	He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
	Let me in safety raise me from my knees
	Or else for ever be confixed here,
	A marble monument.
</MARIANA>

<ANGELO>	<89%>
	I did but smile till now:
	Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice;
	My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
	These poor informal women are no more
	But instruments of some more mightier member
	That sets them on. Let me have way, my lord,
	To find this practice out.
</ANGELO>

<DUKE>	<89%>
	Ay, with my heart;
	And punish them unto your height of pleasure.
	Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
	Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
	Though they would swear down each particular saint,
	Were testimonies against his worth and credit
	That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
	Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
	To find out this abuse, whence 'tis deriv'd.
	There is another friar that set them on;
	Let him be sent for.
</DUKE>

<FRIAR PETER>	<89%>
	Would he were here, my lord; for he indeed
	Hath set the women on to this complaint:

	That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd
	Your unknown sovereignty!
</ISABELLA>

<DUKE>	<94%>
	You are pardon'd, Isabel:
	And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
	Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
	And you may marvel why I obscur'd myself,
	Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
	Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
	Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid!
	It was the swift celerity of his death,
	Which I did think with slower foot came on,
	That brain'd my purpose: but, peace be with him!
	That life is better life, past fearing death,
	Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,
	So happy is your brother.

<ISABELLA>	<95%>
	I do, my lord.

<DUKE>	<95%>
	For this new-married man approaching here,
	Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
	Your well-defended honour, you must pardon
	For Mariana's sake. But as he adjudg'd your brother,—
	Being criminal, in double violation
	Of sacred chastity, and of promise-breach,
	Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,—
	The very mercy of the law cries out
	Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
	'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'
	Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure,
	Like doth quit like, and Measure still for Measure.
	Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested,
	Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
	We do condemn thee to the very block
	Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
	Away with him!
</DUKE>

<MARIANA>	<95%>
	O, my most gracious lord!
	I hope you will not mock me with a husband.
</MARIANA>

<DUKE>	<95%>
	It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
	Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
	I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
	For that he knew you, might reproach your life
	And choke your good to come. For his possessions,
	Although by confiscation they are ours,
	We do instate and widow you withal,
	To buy you a better husband.
</DUKE>

<MARIANA>	<96%>
	O my dear lord!
	I crave no other, nor no better man.

</STAGE DIR> Now, sir, to you.
</DUKE>

<MARIANA>	<96%>
	O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part:
	Lend me your knees, and, all my life to come,
	I'll lend you all my life to do you service,
</MARIANA>

<DUKE>	<96%>
	Against all sense you do importune her:
	Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
	Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
	And take her hence in horror.
</DUKE>

<MARIANA>	<96%>
	Isabel,
	Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me:
	Hold up your hands, say nothing, I'll speak all.
	They say best men are moulded out of faults,
	And, for the most, become much more the better
	For being a little bad: so may my husband.
	O, Isabel! will you not lend a knee?
</MARIANA>

<DUKE>	<96%>
	He dies for Claudio's death.

<STAGE DIR>
<Kneeling.>
</STAGE DIR> Most bounteous sir,
	Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
	As if my brother liv'd. I partly think
	A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
	Till he did look on me: since it is so,
	Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
	In that he did the thing for which he died:
	For Angelo,
	His act did not o'ertake his bad intent;
	And must be buried but as an intent
	That perish'd by the way. Thoughts are no subjects;
	Intents but merely thoughts.
</ISABELLA>

<MARIANA>	<97%>
	Merely, my lord.
</MARIANA>

<DUKE>	<97%>
	Your suit's unprofitable: stand up, I say.
	I have bethought me of another fault.
	Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
	At an unusual hour?
</DUKE>

<PROVOST>	<97%>
	It was commanded so.
</PROVOST>

<DUKE>	<97%>
	Had you a special warrant for the deed?
</DUKE>

<PROVOST>	<97%>
	No, my good lord; it was by private message.
</PROVOST>

<DUKE>	<97%>
	For which I do discharge you of your office:
	Give up your keys.
</DUKE>

<PROVOST>	<97%>
	Pardon me, noble lord:
	I thought it was a fault, but knew it not,
	Yet did repent me, after more advice;
	For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
	That should by private order else have died
	I have reserv'd alive.
</PROVOST>

<DUKE>	<97%>
	What's he?
</DUKE>

<PROVOST>	<97%>
	His name is Barnardine.

	I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
	Go, fetch him hither: let me look upon him.

<ESCALUS>	<97%>
	I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
	As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
	Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood,
	And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.
</ESCALUS>

<ANGELO>	<98%>
	I am sorry that such sorrow I procure;
	And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
	That I crave death more willingly than mercy:

	This, my lord.

<DUKE>	<98%>
	There was a friar told me of this man.
	Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul,
	That apprehends no further than this world,
	And squar'st thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:
	But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all,
	And pray thee take this mercy to provide
	For better times to come. Friar, advise him:
	I leave him to your hand.—What muffled fellow's that?
</DUKE>

<PROVOST>	<98%>
	This is another prisoner that I sav'd,
	That should have died when Claudio lost his head,
	As like almost to Claudio as himself.

<To Isabella.>
</STAGE DIR> If he be like your brother, for his sake
	Is he pardon'd; and, for your lovely sake
	Give me your hand and say you will be mine,
	He is my brother too. But fitter time for that.
	By this, Lord Angelo perceives he's safe:
	Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.
	Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well:
	Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.—
	I find an apt remission in myself,
	And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.—
<STAGE DIR>
<To Lucio.>
</STAGE DIR> You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,
	One all of luxury, an ass, a madman:
	Wherein have I so deserv'd of you,
	That you extol me thus?
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<99%>
	'Faith, my lord, I spoke it but according to the trick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but I had rather it would please you I might be whipped.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<99%>
	Whipp'd first, sir, and hang'd after.
	Proclaim it, provost, round about the city,
	If any woman's wrong'd by this lewd fellow,—
	As I have heard him swear himself there's one
	Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
	And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,
	Let him be whipp'd and hang'd.
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<99%>
	I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore. Your highness said even now, I made you a duke: good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<99%>
	Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
	Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
	Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison,
	And see our pleasure herein executed.
</DUKE>

<LUCIO>	<99%>
	Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death, whipping, and hanging.
</LUCIO>

<DUKE>	<99%>
	Slandering a prince deserves it.
	She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.
	Joy to you, Mariana! love her, Angelo:
	I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.
	Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:
	There's more behind that is more gratulate.
	Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy;
	We shall employ thee in a worthier place.
	Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
	The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:
	The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,
	I have a motion much imports your good;
	Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
	What's mine is yours, and what is yours is mine.
	So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show
	What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.
