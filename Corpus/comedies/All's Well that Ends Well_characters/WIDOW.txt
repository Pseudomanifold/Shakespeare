	Nay, come; for if they do approach the city we shall lose all the sight.

	It is reported that he has taken their greatest commander, and that with his own hand he slew the duke's brother. We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary way: hark! you may know by their trumpets.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>
	I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>
	I hope so. Look, here comes a pilgrim:
	I know she will lie at my house; thither they send one another. I'll question her.
	God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>
	At the Saint Francis, here beside the port.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>
	Ay, marry, is't. Hark you!
	They come this way. If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,
	But till the troops come by,
	I will conduct you where you shall be lodg'd:
	The rather, for I think I know your hostess
	As ample as myself.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 5><54%>
	If you shall please so, pilgrim.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 5><54%>
	You came, I think, from France?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 5><54%>
	Here you shall see a countryman of yours
	That has done worthy service.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 5><54%>
	Ay, right; good creature, wheresoe'er she is,
	Her heart weighs sadly. This young maid might do her
	A shrewd turn if she pleas'd.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 5><55%>
	He does, indeed;
	And brokes with all that can in such a suit
	Corrupt the tender honour of a maid:
	But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard
	In honestest defence.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 5><55%>
	So, now they come.
	That is Antonio, the duke's eldest son;
	That, Escalus.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 5><55%>
	Marry, hang you!
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 5><56%>
	The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you
	Where you shall host: of enjoin'd penitents
	There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,
	Already at my house.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 7><60%>
	Though my estate be fall'n, I was well born,
	Nothing acquainted with these businesses;
	And would not put my reputation now
	In any staining act.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 7><60%>
	I should believe you:
	For you have show'd me that which well approves
	You're great in fortune.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 7><61%>
	Now I see
	The bottom of your purpose.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 7><61%>
	I have yielded.
	Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,
	That time and place with this deceit so lawful
	May prove coherent. Every night he comes
	With musics of all sorts and songs compos'd
	To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us
	To chide him from our eaves, for he persists
	As if his life lay on't.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>
	Gentle madam,
	You never had a servant to whose trust
	Your business was more welcome.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	Lord, how we lose our pains!
<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
	I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour
	Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
	And both shall cease, without your remedy.
