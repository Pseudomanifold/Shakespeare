	Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
	How long hath this possession held the man?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
	Hath he not lost much wealth by wrack of sea?
	Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye
	Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
	A sin prevailing much in youthful men,
	Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.
	Which of these sorrows is he subject to?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
	You should for that have reprehended him.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
	Ay, but not rough enough.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
	Haply, in private.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
	Ay, but not enough.

	And thereof came it that the man was mad:
	The venom clamours of a jealous woman
	Poison more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
	It seems, his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,
	And thereof comes it that his head is light.
	Thou say'st his meat was sauc'd with thy upbraidings:
	Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
	Thereof the raging fire of fever bred:
	And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
	Thou say'st his sports were hinder'd by thy brawls:
	Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
	But moody moping, and dull melancholy,
	Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
	And at her heels a huge infectious troop
	Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
	In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest
	To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:
	The consequence is then, thy jealous fits
	Have scar'd thy husband from the use of wits.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	No; not a creature enters in my house.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,
	And it shall privilege him from your hands
	Till I have brought him to his wits again,
	Or lose my labour in assaying it.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	Be patient; for I will not let him stir
	Till I have us'd the approved means I have,
	With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers,
	To make of him a formal man again.
	It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
	A charitable duty of my order;
	Therefore depart and leave him here with me.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	Be quiet, and depart: thou shalt not have him.

	Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 1><95%>
	Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds,
	And gain a husband by his liberty.
	Speak, old Ægeon, if thou be'st the man
	That hadst a wife once call'd Æmilia,
	That bore thee at a burden two fair sons.
	O! if thou be'st the same Ægeon, speak,
	And speak unto the same Æmilia!
<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
	By men of Epidamnum, he and I,
	And the twin Dromio, all were taken up:
	But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
	By force took Dromio and my son from them,
	And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
	What then became of them, I cannot tell;
	I to this fortune that you see me in.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 1><98%>
	Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
	To go with us into the abbey here,
	And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes;
	And all that are assembled in this place,
	That by this sympathized one day's error
	Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,
	And we shall make full satisfaction.
	Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
	Of you, my sons; and, till this present hour
	My heavy burdens ne'er delivered.
	The duke, my husband, and my children both,
	And you the calendars of their nativity,
	Go to a gossip's feast, and joy with me:
	After so long grief such festivity!
