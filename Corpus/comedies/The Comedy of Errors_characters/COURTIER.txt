	Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.
	I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now:
	Is that the chain you promis'd me to-day?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 3><65%>
	Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir. Will you go with me? we'll mend our dinner here.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 3><65%>
	Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,
	Or, for my diamond, the chain you promis'd,
	And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 3><66%>
	I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:
	I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 3><66%>
	Now, out of doubt, Antipholus is mad,
	Else would he never so demean himself.
	A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
	And for the same he promis'd me a chain:
	Both one and other he denies me now.
	The reason that I gather he is mad,
	Besides this present instance of his rage,
	Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,
	Of his own doors being shut against his entrance
	Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,
	On purpose shut the doors against his way.
	My way is now to hie home to his house,
	And tell his wife, that, being lunatic,
	He rush'd into my house, and took perforce
	My ring away. This course I fittest choose,
	For forty ducats is too much to lose.

	How say you now? is not your husband mad?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 4><70%>
	Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!
<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	When as your husband all in rage, to-day
	Came to my house, and took away my ring,—
	The ring I saw upon his finger now,—
	Straight after did I meet him with a chain.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	As sure, my liege, as I do see your Grace.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 1><98%>
	Sir, I must have that diamond from you.
