<SPEECH 1><ACT 3><SCENE 1><37%>
	Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would fain have either.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	Master Antipholus!
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	I know it well, sir: lo, here is the chain.
	I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine;
	The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.
	Go home with it and please your wife withal;
	And soon at supper-time I'll visit you,
	And then receive my money for the chain.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	You are a merry man, sir: fare you well.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 1><51%>
	Even just the sum that I do owe to you
	Is growing to me by Antipholus;
	And in the instant that I met with you
	He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
	I shall receive the money for the same.
	Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,
	I will discharge my bond, and thank you too.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 1><52%>
	Saving your merry humour, here's the note
	How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat.
	The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion,
	Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
	Than I stand debted to this gentleman:
	I pray you see him presently discharg'd,
	For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 1><53%>
	Then, you will bring the chain to her yourself?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 1><53%>
	Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 1><53%>
	Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:
	Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,
	And I, to blame, have held him here too long.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 1><54%>
	You hear how he importunes me: the chain!
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 1><54%>
	Come, come; you know I gave it you even now.
	Either send the chain or send by me some token.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 1><54%>
	The money that you owe me for the chain.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 1><55%>
	You know I gave it you half an hour since.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 1><55%>
	You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:
	Consider how it stands upon my credit.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 1><55%>
	This touches me in reputation.
	Either consent to pay this sum for me,
	Or I attach you by this officer.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 1><55%>
	Here is thy fee: arrest him, officer.
	I would not spare my brother in this case,
	If he should scorn me so apparently.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 1><56%>
	Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,
	To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 1><77%>
	I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;
	But, I protest, he had the chain of me,
	Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 1><77%>
	Of very reverend reputation, sir,
	Of credit infinite, highly belov'd,
	Second to none that lives here in the city:
	His word might bear my wealth at any time.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 1><77%>
	'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
	Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
	Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.
	Signior Antipholus, I wonder much
	That you would put me to this shame and trouble;
	And not without some scandal to yourself,
	With circumstance and oaths so to deny
	This chain which now you wear so openly:
	Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,
	You have done wrong to this my honest friend,
	Who, but for staying on our controversy,
	Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day.
	This chain you had of me; can you deny it?
<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
	I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	Upon what cause?
<SPEECH 26><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	See where they come: we will behold his death.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	O perjur'd woman! They are both forsworn:
	In this the madman justly chargeth them!
<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
	That he din'd not at home, but was lock'd out.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	He had, my lord; and when he ran in here,
	These people saw the chain about his neck.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
	That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
	I think I did, sir; I deny it not.
