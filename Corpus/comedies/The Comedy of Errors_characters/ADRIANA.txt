	As much, or more we should ourselves complain:

	With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me:
	But if thou live to see like right bereft.
	This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.

	His company must do his minions grace,
	Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
	Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
	From my poor cheek? then, he hath wasted it:
	Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
	If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
	Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
	Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
	That's not my fault; he's master of my state:
	What ruins are in me that can be found
	By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground
	Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
	A sunny look of his would soon repair;
	But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale
	And feeds from home: poor I am but his stale.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
	Unfeeling fools can with such wrengs dispense.
	I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,
	Or else what lets it but he would be here?
	Sister, you know he promis'd me a chain:
	Would that alone, alone he would detain,
	So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
	I see, the jewel best enamelled
	Will lose his beauty; and though gold bides still
	That others touch, yet often touching will
	Wear gold; and no man that hath a name,
	By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
	Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
	I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange, and frown:
	Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects,
	I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.
	The time was once when thou unurg'd wouldst vow
	That never words were music to thine ear,
	That never object pleasing in thine eye,
	That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
	That never meat sweet-savour'd in thy taste,
	Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carv'd to thee.
	How comes it now, my husband, O! how comes it,
	That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
	Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
	That, undividable, incorporate,
	Am better than thy dear self's better part.
	Ah! do not tear away thyself from me,
	For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall
	A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
	And take unmingled thence that drop again,
	Without addition or diminishing,
	As take from me thyself and not me too.
	How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,
	Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious,
	And that this body, consecrate to thee,
	By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
	Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me,
	And hurl the name of husband in my face,
	And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow,
	And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
	And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
	I know thou canst; and therefore, see thou do it.
	I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
	My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
	For if we two be one and thou play false,
	I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
	Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
	Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed;
	I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.

	By thee; and this thou didst return from him,
	That he did buffet thee, and in his blows,
	Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	How ill agrees it with your gravity
	To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
	A betting him to thwart me in my mood!
	Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
	But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
	Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine;
	Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
	Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
	Makes me with thy strength to communicate:
	If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
	Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
	Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion
	Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	Come, come; no longer will I be a fool,
	To put the finger in the eye and weep,

	Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
	Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day,
	And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
	Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
	Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
	Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>

	Ah! Luciana, did he tempt thee so?

	What observation mad'st thou in this case
	Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 2><58%>
	He meant he did me none; the more my spite.

	Didst speak him fair?

	I cannot, nor I will not hold me still:

	Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind,
	Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 2><59%>
	Ah! but I think him better than I say,
	And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.

	Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.

	Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!
<SPEECH 72><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	May it please your Grace, Antipholus, my husband,
	Whom I made lord of me and all I had,
	At your important letters, this ill day
	A most outrageous fit of madness took him,
	That desperately he hurried through the street,—
	With him his bondman, all as mad as he,—
	Doing displeasure to the citizens
	By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
	Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like.
	Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
	Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went
	That here and there his fury had committed.
	Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
	He broke from those that had the guard of him,
	And with his mad attendant and himself,
	Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords
	Met us again, and, madly bent on us
	Chas'd us away, till, raising of more aid
	We came again to bind them. Then they fled
	Into this abbey, whither we pursu'd them;
	And here the abbess shuts the gates on us,
	And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
	Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
	Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command
	Let him be brought forth, and borne hence for help.
<SPEECH 73><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,
	And that is false thou dost report to us.
<SPEECH 74><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you,
	That he is borne about invisible:
	Even now we hous'd him in the abbey here,
	And now he's here, past thought of human reason.
<SPEECH 75><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	No, my good lord: myself, he, and my sister
	To-day did dine together. So befall my soul
	As this is false he burdens me withal!

	I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me!
