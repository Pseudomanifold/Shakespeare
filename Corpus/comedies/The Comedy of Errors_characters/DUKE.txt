	Merchant of Syracusa, plead no more.
	I am not partial to infringe our laws:
	The enmity and discord which of late
	Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
	To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
	Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,
	Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
	Excludes all pity from our threat'ning looks.
	For, since the mortal and intestine jars
	'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
	It hath in solemn synods been decreed,
	Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
	T' admit no traffic to our adverse towns:
	Nay, more, if any, born at Ephesus
	Be seen at Syracusian marts and fairs;
	Again, if any Syracusian born
	Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
	His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose;
	Unless a thousand marks be levied,
	To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
	Thy substance, valu'd at the highest rate,
	Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
	Therefore, by law thou art condemn'd to die.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Well, Syracusian; say, in brief the cause
	Why thou departedst from thy native home,
	And for what cause thou cam'st to Ephesus.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;
	For we may pity, though not pardon thee.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	And, for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
	Do me the favour to dilate at full
	What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	Hapless Ã†geon, whom the fates have mark'd
	To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
	Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
	Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
	Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
	My soul should sue as advocate for thee.
	But though thou art adjudged to the death
	And passed sentence may not be recall'd
	But to our honour's great disparagement,
	Yet will I favour thee in what I can:
	Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
	To seek thy life by beneficial help.
	Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
	Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
	And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
	Gaoler, take him to thy custody.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	Yet once again proclaim it publicly,
	If any friend will pay the sum for him,
	He shall not die; so much we tender him.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:
	It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	Long since thy husband serv'd me in my wars,
	And I to thee engag'd a prince's word,
	When thou didst make him master of thy bed,
	To do him all the grace and good I could.
	Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate
	And bid the lady abbess come to me.
	I will determine this before I stir.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds!
<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	But had he such a chain of thee, or no?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
	I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
	If here you hous'd him, here he would have been;
	If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly;
	You say he din'd at home; the goldsmith here
	Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.
	I think you are all mated or stark mad.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
	I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years
	Have I been patron to Antipholus,
	During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa.
	I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.

	One of these men is Genius to the other;
	And so of these: which is the natural man,
	And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
	Why, here begins his morning story right:
	These two Antipholus', these two so like,
	And these two Dromios, one in semblance,
	Besides her urging of her wrack at sea;
	These are the parents to these children,
	Which accidentally are met together.
	Antipholus, thou cam'st from Corinth first?
<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
	Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 1><98%>
	It shall not need: thy father hath his life.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 1><99%>
	With all my heart I'll gossip at this feast.
