	I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear.

	Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.

	Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.

	In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.

	Have patience, sir; O! let it not be so;
	Herein you war against your reputation,
	And draw within the compass of suspect
	The unviolated honour of your wife.
	Once this,â€”your long experience of her wisdom,
	Her sober virtue, years, and modesty,
	Plead on her part some cause to you unknown;
	And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
	Why at this time the doors are made against you.
	Be rul'd by me: depart in patience,
	And let us to the Tiger all to dinner;
	And about evening come yourself alone,
	To know the reason of this strange restraint.
	If by strong hand you offer to break in
	Now in the stirring passage of the day,
	A vulgar comment will be made of it,
	And that supposed by the common rout
	Against your yet ungalled estimation,
	That may with foul intrusion enter in
	And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
	For slander lives upon succession,
	For ever housed where it gets possession.
