	You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	Lady, you come hither to be married to this count?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	If either of you know any inward impediment, why you should not be conjoined, I charge you, on your souls, to utter it.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	Know you any, count?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
	Have comfort, lady.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
	Yea; wherefore should she not?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
	Hear me a little;
	For I have only been silent so long,
	And given way unto this course of fortune,
	By noting of the lady: I have mark'd
	A thousand blushing apparitions
	To start into her face; a thousand innocent shames
	In angel whiteness bear away those blushes;
	And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,
	To burn the errors that these princess hold
	Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;
	Trust not my reading nor my observations,
	Which with experimental seal doth warrant
	The tenour of my book; trust not my age,
	My reverence, calling, nor divinity,
	If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
	Under some biting error.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
	Lady, what man is he you are accus'd of?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
	There is some strange misprision in the princes.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	Pause awhile,
	And let my counsel sway you in this case.
	Your daughter here the princes left for dead;
	Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
	And publish it that she is dead indeed:
	Maintain a mourning ostentation;
	And on your family's old monument
	Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
	That appertain unto a burial.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf
	Change slander to remorse; that is some good:
	But not for that dream I on this strange course,
	But on this travail look for greater birth.
	She dying, as it must be so maintain'd,
	Upon the instant that she was accus'd,
	Shall be lamented, pitied and excus'd
	Of every hearer; for it so falls out
	That what we have we prize not to the worth
	Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,
	Why, then we rack the value, then we find
	The virtue that possession would not show us
	Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:
	When he shall hear she died upon his words,
	The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
	Into his study of imagination,
	And every lovely organ of her life
	Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,
	More moving-delicate, and full of life
	Into the eye and prospect of his soul,
	Than when she liv'd indeed: then shall he mourn,—
	If ever love had interest in his liver,—
	And wish he had not so accused her,
	No, though he thought his accusation true.
	Let this be so, and doubt not but success
	Will fashion the event in better shape
	Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
	But if all aim but this be levell'd false,
	The supposition of the lady's death
	Will quench the wonder of her infamy:
	And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,—
	As best befits her wounded reputation,—
	In some reclusive and religious life,
	Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	'Tis well consented: presently away;
	For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.
	Come, lady, die to live: this wedding day
	Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
	Did I not tell you she was innocent?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
	To do what, signior?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 4><96%>
	And my help.
	Here come the prince and Claudio.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 4><97%>
	All this amazement can I qualify:
	When after that the holy rites are ended,
	I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death:
	Meantime, let wonder seem familiar,
	And to the chapel let us presently.
