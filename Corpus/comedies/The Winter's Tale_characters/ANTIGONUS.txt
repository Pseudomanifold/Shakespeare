	Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice

	Yourself, your queen, your son.

	If it prove
	She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where
	I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;

	Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false,

	It is for you we speak, not for ourselves.
	You are abus'd, and by some putter-on
	That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,
	I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,â€”
	I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven,
	The second and the third, nine and some five;
	If this prove true, they'll pay for't: by mine honour,
	I'll geld them all; fourteen they shall not see,
	To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;
	And I had rather glib myself than they
	Should not produce fair issue.

	If it be so,

	I told her so, my lord,

	I did not, sir:

	Can clear me in't.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
	Any thing, my lord,
	That my ability may undergo,

	To save the innocent: any thing possible.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
	I will, my lord.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
	I swear to do this, though a present death
	Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:
	Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
	To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say,
	Casting their savageness aside have done
	Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous
	In more than this deed doth require! And blessing
	Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
	Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!

	Thou art perfect, then, our ship hath touch'd upon

	Go thou away:
	I'll follow instantly.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 3><42%>
	Come, poor babe:
	I have heard, but not believ'd, the spirits o' the dead
	May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother
	Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream
	So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
	Sometimes her head on one side, some another;
	I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
	So fill'd, and so becoming: in pure white robes,
	Like very sanctity, she did approach
	My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,
	And, gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
	Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
	Did this break from her: 'Good Antigonus,
	Since fate, against thy better disposition,
	Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
	Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
	Places remote enough are in Bohemia,
	There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe
	Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,
	I prithee, call't: for this ungentle business,
	Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
	Thy wife Paulina more:' and so, with shrieks,
	She melted into air. Affrighted much,
	I did in time collect myself, and thought
	This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys;
	Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,
	I will be squar'd by this. I do believe
	Hermione hath suffer'd death; and that
	Apollo would, this being indeed the issue
	Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
	Either for life or death, upon the earth
	Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!
	There lie; and there thy character: there these;
	Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
	And still rest thine. The storm begins: poor wretch!
	That for thy mother's fault art thus expos'd
	To loss and what may follow. Weep I cannot,
	But my heart bleeds, and most accurs'd am I
	To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
	The day frowns more and more: thou art like to have
	A lullaby too rough. I never saw
	The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
	Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:
	I am gone for ever.
