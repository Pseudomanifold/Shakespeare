	Turn all to the best! These proclamations,
	So forcing faults upon Hermione,

	Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd
	A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make
	Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
	More penitence than done trespass. At the last,
	Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;
	With them forgive yourself.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	Not at all, good lady:
	You might have spoken a thousand things that would
	Have done the time more benefit, and grac'd
	Your kindness better.

	You tempt him over much.

	Good madam,â€”
