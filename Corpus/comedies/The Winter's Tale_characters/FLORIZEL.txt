	These your unusual weeds to each part of you
	Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora
	Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing
	Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
	And you the queen on't.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 3><54%>
	I bless the time
	When my good falcon made her flight across
	Thy father's ground.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 3><54%>
	Apprehend
	Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
	Humbling their deities to love, have taken
	The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter
	Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune
	A ram, and bleated; and the fire-rob'd god,
	Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
	As I seem now. Their transformations
	Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,
	Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
	Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts
	Burn hotter than my faith.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 3><55%>
	Thou dearest Perdita,
	With these forc'd thoughts, I prithee, darken not
	The mirth o' the feast: or I'll be thine, my fair,
	Or not my father's; for I cannot be
	Mine own, nor anything to any, if
	I be not thine: to this I am most constant,
	Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;
	Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
	That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:
	Lift up your countenance, as it were the day
	Of celebration of that nuptial which
	We two have sworn shall come.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 3><55%>
	See, your guests approach:
	Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
	And let's be red with mirth.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 3><58%>
	What! like a corse?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 3><58%>
	What you do
	Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet,
	I'd have you do it ever: when you sing,
	I'd have you buy and sell so; so give alms;
	Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,
	To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you
	A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do
	Nothing but that; move still, still so,
	And own no other function: each your doing,
	So singular in each particular,
	Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,
	That all your acts are queens.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 3><58%>
	I think you have
	As little skill to fear as I have purpose
	To put you to't. But, come; our dance, I pray.
	Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair
	That never mean to part.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 3><65%>
	Old sir, I know
	She prizes not such trifles as these are.
	The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
	Up in my heart, which I have given already,
	But not deliver'd. O! hear me breathe my life
	Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,
	Hath sometime lov'd: I take thy hand; this hand,
	As soft as dove's down, and as white as it,
	Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd snow
	That's bolted by the northern blasts twice o'er.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 3><65%>
	Do, and be witness to't.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 3><65%>
	And he, and more
	Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all;
	That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,
	Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth
	That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge
	More than was ever man's, I would not prize them
	Without her love: for her employ them all;
	Commend them and condemn them to her service
	Or to their own perdition.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 3><66%>
	O! that must be
	I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,
	I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
	Enough then for your wonder. But, come on;
	Contract us 'fore these witnesses.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 3><66%>
	I have; but what of him?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 3><66%>
	He neither does nor shall.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 3><66%>
	No, good sir:
	He has his health and ampler strength indeed
	Than most have of his age.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 3><67%>
	I yield all this;
	But for some other reasons, my grave sir,
	Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint
	My father of this business.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 3><67%>
	He shall not.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 3><67%>
	No, he must not.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 3><67%>
	Come, come, he must not.
	Mark our contract.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 3><68%>
	Why look you so upon me?
	I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
	But nothing alter'd. What I was, I am:
	More straining on for plucking back; not following
	My leash unwillingly.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 3><69%>
	I not purpose it.
	I think, Camillo?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 3><69%>
	It cannot fail but by
	The violation of my faith; and then
	Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together
	And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:
	From my succession wipe me, father; I
	Am heir to my affection.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 3><69%>
	I am; and by my fancy: if my reason
	Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;
	If not, my senses, better pleas'd with madness,
	Do bid it welcome.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 3><69%>
	So call it; but it does fulfil my vow,
	I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,
	Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may
	Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or
	The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
	In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath
	To this my fair belov'd. Therefore, I pray you,
	As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,
	When he shall miss me,—as, in faith, I mean not
	To see him any more,—cast your good counsels
	Upon his passion: let myself and fortune
	Tug for the time to come. This you may know
	And so deliver, I am put to sea
	With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;
	And most opportune to our need, I have
	A vessel rides fast by, but not prepar'd
	For this design. What course I mean to hold
	Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor
	Concern me the reporting.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	Hark, Perdita. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> I'll hear you by and by.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	Now, good Camillo,
	I am so fraught with curious business that
	I leave out ceremony.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	Very nobly
	Have you deserv'd: it is my father's music
	To speak your deeds, not little of his care
	To have them recompens'd as thought on.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
	How, Camillo,
	May this, almost a miracle, be done?
	That I may call thee something more than man,
	And, after that trust to thee.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
	Not any yet;
	But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
	To what we wildly do, so we profess
	Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
	Of every wind that blows.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
	Worthy Camillo,
	What colour for my visitation shall I
	Hold up before him?
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 3><72%>
	I am bound to you.
	There is some sap in this.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 3><72%>
	My good Camillo,
	She is as forward of her breeding as
	She is i' the rear o' her birth.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 3><72%>
	My prettiest Perdita!
	But O! the thorns we stand upon. Camillo,
	Preserver of my father, now of me,
	The med'cine of our house, how shall we do?
	We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,
	Nor shall appear in Sicilia.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 3><74%>
	And those that you'll procure from King Leontes—
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 3><74%>
	Dispatch, I prithee.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	Should I now meet my father
	He would not call me son.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
	Pray you, a word.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	Fortune speed us!
	Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	By his command
	Have I here touch'd Sicilia; and from him
	Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,
	Can send his brother: and, but infirmity,—
	Which waits upon worn times,—hath something seiz'd
	His wish'd ability, he had himself
	The land and waters 'twixt your throne and his
	Measur'd to look upon you, whom he loves—
	He bade me say so—more than all the sceptres
	And those that bear them living.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	Good my lord,
	She came from Libya.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter
	His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence—
	A prosperous south-wind friendly—we have cross'd,
	To execute the charge my father gave me
	For visiting your highness: my best train
	I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;
	Who for Bohemia bend, to signify
	Not only my success in Libya, sir,
	But my arrival and my wife's, in safety
	Here where we are.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Camillo has betray'd me;
	Whose honour and whose honesty till now
	Endur'd all weathers.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;
	The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:
	The odds for high and low's alike.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	She is,
	When once she is my wife.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	Dear, look up:
	Though Fortune, visible an enemy,
	Should chase us with my father, power no jot
	Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,
	Remember since you ow'd no more to time
	Than I do now; with thought of such affections,
	Step forth mine advocate; at your request
	My father will grant precious things as trifles
