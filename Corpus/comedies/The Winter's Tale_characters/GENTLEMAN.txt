	One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,
	Son of Polixenes, with his princess,—she
	The fairest I have yet beheld,—desires access
	To your high presence.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	But few,
	And those but mean.

	Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,
	That e'er the sun shone bright on.

	Pardon, madam:
	The one I have almost forgot—your pardon—
	The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,
	Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,
	Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
	Of all professors else, make proselytes
	Of who she but bid follow.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	Women will love her, that she is a woman
	More worth than any man; men, that she is
	The rarest of all women.

	I make a broken delivery of the business; but the changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with staring on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the extremity of the one it must needs be.
	Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more. The news, Rogero?
