	You look not well, Signior Antonio;
	You have too much respect upon the world:
	They lose it that do buy it with much care:
	Believe me, you are marvellously chang'd.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Let me play the fool:
	With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,
	And let my liver rather heat with wine
	Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
	Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,
	Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
	Sleep when he wakes, and creep into the jaundice
	By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio—
	I love thee, and it is my love that speaks—
	There are a sort of men whose visages
	Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
	And do a wilful stillness entertain,
	With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
	Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit;
	As who should say, 'I am Sir Oracle,
	And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'
	O, my Antonio, I do know of these,
	That therefore only are reputed wise
	For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,
	If they should speak, would almost damn those ears
	Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.
	I'll tell thee more of this another time:
	But fish not, with this melancholy bait,
	For this fool-gudgeon, this opinion.
	Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:
	I'll end my exhortation after dinner.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Well, keep me company but two years moe,
	Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Thanks, i' faith; for silence is only commendable
	In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	Where is your master?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	Signior Bassanio!—
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	I have a suit to you.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	Signior Bassanio, hear me:
	If I do not put on a sober habit,
	Talk with respect, and swear but now and then,
	Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,
	Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes
	Thus with my hat, and sigh, and say 'amen;'
	Use all the observance of civility,
	Like one well studied in a sad ostent
	To please his grandam, never trust me more.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	Nay, but I bar to-night; you shall not gauge me
	By what we do to-night.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	And I must to Lorenzo and the rest;
	But we will visit you at supper-time.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
	We have not made good preparation.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
	Love news, in faith.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 4><31%>
	Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
	This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo
	Desir'd us to make stand.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
	And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
	For lovers ever run before the clock.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
	That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
	With that keen appetite that he sits down?
	Where is the horse that doth untread again
	His tedious measures with the unbated fire
	That he did pace them first? All things that are,
	Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.
	How like a younker or a prodigal
	The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,
	Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!
	How like the prodigal doth she return,
	With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,
	Lean, rent, and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 6><36%>
	Now, by my hood, a Gentile, and no Jew.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 6><36%>
	Signior Antonio!
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 6><36%>
	I am glad on't: I desire no more delight
	Than to be under sail and gone to-night.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	My Lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,
	I wish you all the joy that you can wish;
	For I am sure you can wish none from me:
	And when your honours mean to solemnize
	The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,
	Even at that time I may be married too.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
	My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:
	You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;
	You lov'd, I lov'd for intermission.
	No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.
	Your fortune stood upon the caskets there,
	And so did mine too, as the matter falls;
	For wooing here until I sweat again,
	And swearing till my very roof was dry
	With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,
	I got a promise of this fair one here
	To have her love, provided that your fortune
	Achiev'd her mistress.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	Yes, faith, my lord.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down.
	But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel?
	What! and my old Venetian friend, Salanio?
<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
	Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.
	Your hand, Salanio. What's the news from Venice?
	How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
	I know he will be glad of our success;
	We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 1><75%>
	Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
	Thou mak'st thy knife keen; but no metal can,
	No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness
	Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?
<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 1><75%>
	O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!
	And for thy life let justice be accus'd.
	Thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith
	To hold opinion with Pythagoras,
	That souls of animals infuse themselves
	Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit
	Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,
	Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,
	And whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,
	Infus'd itself in thee; for thy desires
	Are wolfish, bloody, starv'd, and ravenous.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 1><81%>
	I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:
	I would she were in heaven, so she could
	Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.

	O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!

	A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
	Now, infidel, I have thee on the hip.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 1><83%>
	A Daniel, still say I; a second Daniel!
	I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 1><84%>
	Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:
	And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
	Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
	Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.

	A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake!

<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 2><88%>
	Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en.
	My Lord Bassanio upon more advice
	Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat
	Your company at dinner.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 2><88%>
	That will I do.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
	</STAGE DIR> By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;
	In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:
	Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,
	Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
	About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
	That she did give me, whose poesy was
	For all the world like cutlers' poetry
	Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'
<SPEECH 42><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
	He will, an if he live to be a man.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 1><95%>
	Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
	A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
	No higher than thyself, the judge's clerk.
	A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:
	I could not for my heart deny it him.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 1><95%>
	My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
	Unto the judge that begg'd it, and indeed
	Deserv'd it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
	That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;
	And neither man nor master would take aught
	But the two rings.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
	Well, do you so: let me not take him, then;
	For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 5><SCENE 1><98%>
	Why, this is like the mending of highways
	In summer, where the ways are fair enough.
	What! are we cuckolds ere we have deserv'd it?
<SPEECH 47><ACT 5><SCENE 1><99%>
	Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 1><100%>
	Let it be so: the first inter'gatory
	That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,
	Whe'r till the next night she had rather stay,
	Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:
	But were the day come, I should wish it dark,
	That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
	Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing
	So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.
