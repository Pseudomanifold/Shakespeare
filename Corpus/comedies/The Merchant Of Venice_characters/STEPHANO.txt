	A friend.

	Stephano is my name; and I bring word
	My mistress will before the break of day
	Be here at Belmont: she doth stray about
	By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays
	For happy wedlock hours.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	None, but a holy hermit and her maid.
	I pray you, is my master yet return'd?
