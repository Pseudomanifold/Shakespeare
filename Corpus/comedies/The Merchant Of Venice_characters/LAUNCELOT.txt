	Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow, and tempts me, saying to me, 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or 'good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.' My conscience says, 'No; take heed, honest Launcelot; take heed, honest Gobbo;' or, as aforesaid, 'honest Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,' says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me, 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest man's son,'—or rather an honest woman's son;—for, indeed, my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a kind of taste;—well, my conscience says, 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience. 'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' 'fiend,' say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master, who, God bless the mark! is a kind of devil; and, to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil himself. Certainly, the Jew is the very devil incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are at your commandment; I will run.

	Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but, at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn down indirectly to the Jew's house.

	</STAGE DIR> Mark me now; now will I raise the waters. Talk you of young Master Launcelot?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 2><23%>
	Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk of young Master Launcelot.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 2><23%>
	But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you, talk you of young Master Launcelot?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 2><23%>
	Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master Launcelot, father; for the young gentleman,—according to Fates and Destinies and such odd sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of learning,—is, indeed, deceased; or, as you would say in plain terms, gone to heaven.

	Do you not know me, father?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
	Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of your son. Give me your blessing; truth will come to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son may, but, in the end, truth will out.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
	Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but give me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your boy that was, your son that is, your child that shall be.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
	I know not what I shall think of that; but I am Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother.

	Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have run some ground. My master's a very Jew: give him a present! give him a halter: I am farnished in his service; you may tell every finger I have with my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come: give me your present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed, gives rare new liveries. If I serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare fortune! here comes the man: to him, father; for I am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
	To him, father.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man; that would, sir,—as my father shall specify,—
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and have a desire, as my father shall specify,—
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew having done me wrong, doth cause me,—as my father, being, I hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you,—
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as your worship shall know by this honest old man; and, though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	Serve you, sir.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	The old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of God, sir, and he hath enough.

	Father, in. I cannot get a service, no; I have ne'er a tongue in my head. Well, <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> if any man in Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to; here's a simple line of life: here's a small trifle of wives: alas! fifteen wives is nothing: a 'leven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one man; and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed; here are simple 'scapes. Well, if Fortune be a woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father, come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.

	Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew! If a Christian did not play the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But, adieu! these foolish drops do somewhat drown my manly spirit: adieu!

	I beseech you, sir, go: my young master doth expect your reproach.

	And they have conspired together: I will not say you shall see a masque; but if you do, then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black-Monday last, at six o'clock i' the morning, falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four year in the afternoon.

	I will go before, air. Mistress, look out at window, for all this;

<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 5><67%>
	Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children; therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter: therefore be of good cheer; for, truly, I think you are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 5><67%>
	Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the Jew's daughter.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 5><67%>
	Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are gone both ways.

	Truly the more to blame he: we were Christians enow before; e'en as many as could well live one by another. This making of Christians will raise the price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.
