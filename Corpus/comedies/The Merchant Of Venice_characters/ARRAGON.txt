<SPEECH 1><ACT 2><SCENE 1><42%>
	I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
	First, never to unfold to any one
	Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail
	Of the right casket, never in my life
	To woo a maid in way of marriage;
	Lastly,
	If I do fail in fortune of my choice,
	Immediately to leave you and be gone.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><42%>
	And so have I address'd me. Fortune now
	To my heart's hope! Gold, silver, and base lead.
	Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath:
	You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.
	What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:
	Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.
	What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant
	By the fool multitude, that choose by show,
	Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
	Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,
	Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
	Even in the force and road of casualty.
	I will not choose what many men desire,
	Because I will not jump with common spirits
	And rank me with the barbarous multitude.
	Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;
	Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
	Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.
	And well said too; for who shall go about
	To cozen fortune and be honourable
	Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
	To wear an undeserved dignity.
	O! that estates, degrees, and offices
	Were not deriv'd corruptly, and that clear honour
	Were purchas'd by the merit of the wearer.
	How many then should cover that stand bare;
	How many be commanded that command;
	How much low peasantry would then be glean'd
	From the true seed of honour; and how much honour
	Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
	To be new varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:
	Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.
	I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,
	And instantly unlock my fortunes here.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><44%>
	What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,
	Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.
	How much unlike art thou to Portia!
	How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
	Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.
	Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
	Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><44%>
	What is here?
	The fire seven times tried this:
	Seven times tried that judgment is
	That did never choose amiss.
	Some there be that shadows kiss;
	Such have but a shadow's bliss:
	There be fools alive, I wis,
	Silver'd o'er; and so was this.
	Take what wife you will to bed,
	I will ever be your head:
	So be gone, sir: you are sped.
	Still more fool I shall appear
	By the time I linger here:
	With one fool's head I came to woo,
	But I go away with two.
	Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath,
	Patiently to bear my wroth.
