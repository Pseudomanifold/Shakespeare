	In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
	It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
	But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
	What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
	I am to learn;
	And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
	That I have much ado to know myself.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
	My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
	Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
	Upon the fortune of this present year:
	Therefore, my merchandise makes me not sad.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Fie, fie!
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Your worth is very dear in my regard.
	I take it, your own business calls on you,
	And you embrace the occasion to depart.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
	A stage where every man must play a part,
	And mine a sad one.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	Is that anything now?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	Well, tell me now, what lady is the same
	To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,
	That you to-day promis'd to tell me of?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
	And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
	Within the eye of honour, be assur'd,
	My purse, my person, my extremest means,
	Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	You know me well, and herein spend but time
	To wind about my love with circumstance;
	And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
	In making question of my uttermost
	Than if you had made waste of all I have:
	Then do but say to me what I should do
	That in your knowledge may by me be done,
	And I am prest unto it: therefore speak.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	Thou knowest that all my fortunes are at sea;
	Neither have I money, nor commodity
	To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;
	Try what my credit can in Venice do:
	That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,
	To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
	Go, presently inquire, and so will I,
	Where money is, and I no question make
	To have it of my trust or for my sake.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow
	By taking nor by giving of excess,
	Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
	I'll break a custom. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Is he yet possess'd
	How much ye would?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	And for three months.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	I do never use it.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	And what of him? did he take interest?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv'd for;
	A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
	But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.
	Was this inserted to make interest good?
	Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	Mark you this, Bassanio,
	The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
	An evil soul, producing holy witness,
	Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
	A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
	O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	I am as like to call thee so again,
	To spet on thee again, to spurn thee too.
	If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
	As to thy friends,—for when did friendship take
	A breed for barren metal of his friend?—
	But lend it rather to thine enemy;
	Who if he break, thou mayst with better face
	Exact the penalty.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	This were kindness.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond,
	And say there is much kindness in the Jew.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:
	Within these two months, that's a month before
	This bond expires, I do expect return
	Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
	Hie thee, gentle Jew.
	This Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
	Come on: in this there can be no dismay;
	My ships come home a month before the day.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 6><36%>
	Who's there?
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 6><36%>
	Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?
	'Tis nine o'clock; our friends all stay for you.
	No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
	Bassanio presently will go aboard:
	I have sent twenty out to seek for you.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 3><62%>
	Hear me yet, good Shylock.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 3><62%>
	I pray thee, hear me speak.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 3><63%>
	Let him alone:
	I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
	He seeks my life; his reason well I know.
	I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
	Many that have at times made moan to me;
	Therefore he hates me.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 3><63%>
	The duke cannot deny the course of law:
	For the commodity that strangers have
	With us in Venice, if it be denied,
	'Twill much impeach the justice of the state;
	Since that the trade and profit of the city
	Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:
	These griefs and losses have so bated me,
	That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
	To-morrow to my bloody creditor.
	Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come
	To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	Ready, so please your Grace.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	I have heard
	Your Grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
	His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,
	And that no lawful means can carry me
	Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose
	My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
	To suffer with a quietness of spirit
	The very tyranny and rage of his.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 1><73%>
	I pray you, think you question with the Jew:
	You may as well go stand upon the beach,
	And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
	You may as well use question with the wolf,
	Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
	You may as well forbid the mountain pines
	To wag their high tops, and to make no noise
	When they are fretted with the gusts of heaven;
	You may as well do anything most hard,
	As seek to soften that—than which what's harder?—
	His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,
	Make no more offers, use no further means;
	But with all brief and plain conveniency,
	Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 1><74%>
	I am a tainted wether of the flock,
	Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
	Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me:
	You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,
	Than to live still, and write mine epitaph.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 1><77%>
	Ay, so he says.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 1><77%>
	I do.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 1><79%>
	Most heartily I do beseech the court
	To give the judgment.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 1><80%>
	But little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd.
	Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!
	Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
	For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
	Than is her custom: it is still her use
	To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
	To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
	An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
	Of such a misery doth she cut me off.
	Commend me to your honourable wife:
	Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
	Say how I lov'd you, speak me fair in death;
	And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
	Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
	Repent not you that you shall lose your friend,
	And he repents not that he pays your debt;
	For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
	I'll pay it instantly with all my heart.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 4><SCENE 1><84%>
	So please my lord the duke, and all the court,
	To quit the fine for one half of his goods,
	I am content; so he will let me have
	The other half in use, to render it,
	Upon his death, unto the gentleman
	That lately stole his daughter:
	Two things provided more, that, for this favour,
	He presently become a Christian;
	The other, that he do record a gift,
	Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,
	Unto his son Lorenzo, and his daughter.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 4><SCENE 1><86%>
	And stand indebted, over and above,
	In love and service to you evermore.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 4><SCENE 1><87%>
	My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:
	Let his deservings and my love withal
	Be valu'd 'gainst your wife's commandment.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
	No more than I am well acquitted of.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
	I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 1><98%>
	I once did lend my body for his wealth,
	Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,
	Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,
	My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
	Will never more break faith advisedly.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 5><SCENE 1><98%>
	Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 5><SCENE 1><99%>
	I am dumb.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 1><99%>
	Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
	For here I read for certain that my ships
	Are safely come to road.
