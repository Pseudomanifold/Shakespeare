	No, I will rob Tellus of her weed,
	To strew thy green with flowers; the yellows, blues,
	The purple violets, and marigolds,
	Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,
	While summer days do last. Ay me! poor maid,
	Born in a tempest, when my mother died,
	This world to me is like a lasting storm,
	Whirring me from my friends.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
	No, I pray you;
	I'll not bereave you of your servant.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	Well, I will go;
	But yet I have no desire to it.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	My thanks, sweet madam.
	Is this wind westerly that blows?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	When I was born, the wind was north.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	My father, as nurse said, did never fear,
	But cried 'Good seamen!' to the sailors, galling
	His kingly hands haling ropes;
	And, clasping to the mast, endur'd a sea
	That almost burst the deck.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	When I was born:
	Never were waves nor wind more violent;
	And from the ladder-tackle washes off
	A canvas-climber. 'Ha!' says one, 'wilt out?'
	And with a dropping industry they skip
	From stem to stern; the boatswain whistles, and
	The master calls, and trebles their confusion.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	What mean you?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	Why will you kill me?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	Why would she have me kill'd?
	Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
	I never did her hurt in all my life.
	I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn
	To any living creature; believe me, la,
	I never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly;
	I trod upon a worm against my will,
	But I wept for it. How have I offended,
	Wherein my death might yield her any profit,
	Or my life imply her any danger?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	You will not do 't for all the world, I hope.
	You are well favour'd, and your looks foreshow
	You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately,
	When you caught hurt in parting two that fought;
	Good sooth, it show'd well in you; do so now;
	Your lady seeks my life; come you between,
	And save poor me, the weaker.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Alack! that Leonine was so slack, so slow.
	He should have struck, not spoke; or that these pirates—
	Not enough barbarous—had not o'erboard thrown me
	For to seek my mother!
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	That I am pretty.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	I accuse them not.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	The more my fault
	To 'scape his hands where I was like to die.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	No.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	Are you a woman?
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	An honest woman, or not a woman.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	The gods defend me!
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	I understand you not.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
	If fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep,
	Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.
	Diana, aid my purpose!
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 6><77%>
	I desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 6><77%>
	If he govern the country, you are bound to him indeed; but how honourable he is in that I know not.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 6><77%>
	What he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 6><77%>
	What trade, sir?
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 6><77%>
	I cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 6><77%>
	E'er since I can remember.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 6><77%>
	Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 6><78%>
	Do you know this house to be a place of such resort, and will come into 't? I hear say you are of honourable parts, and are the governor of this place.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 6><78%>
	Who is my principal?
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 6><78%>
	If you were born to honour, show it now;
	If put upon you, make the judgment good
	That thought you worthy of it.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 6><78%>
	For me,
	That am a maid, though most ungentle fortune
	Hath plac'd me in this sty, where, since I came,
	Diseases have been sold dearer than physic,
	O! that the gods
	Would set me free from this unhallow'd place,
	Though they did change me to the meanest bird
	That flies i' the purer air!
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 6><79%>
	The good gods preserve you!
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
	Whither would you have me?
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
	Hark, hark, you gods!
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 6><81%>
	Whither wilt thou have me?
<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 6><81%>
	Prithee, tell me one thing first.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 6><81%>
	What canst thou wish thine enemy to be?
<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 6><81%>
	Neither of these are so bad as thou art,
	Since they do better thee in their command.
	Thou hold'st a place, for which the pained'st fiend
	Of hell would not in reputation change;
	Thou art the damned door-keeper to every
	Coystril that comes inquiring for his Tib,
	To the choleric fisting of every rogue
	Thy ear is liable, thy food is such
	As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 4><SCENE 6><81%>
	Do any thing but this thou doest. Empty.
	Old receptacles, or common sewers, of filth;
	Serve by indenture to the common hangman:
	Any of these ways are yet better than this;
	For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,
	Would own a name too dear. O! that the gods
	Would safely deliver me from this place.
	Here, here's gold for thee.
	If that thy master would gain by me,
	Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,
	With other virtues, which I'll keep from boast;
	And I will undertake all these to teach.
	I doubt not but this populous city will
	Yield many scholars.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 4><SCENE 6><82%>
	Prove that I cannot, take me home again,
	And prostitute me to the basest groom
	That doth frequent your house.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 4><SCENE 6><82%>
	But, amongst honest women.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Sir, I will use
	My utmost skill in his recovery,
	Provided
	That none but I and my companion maid
	Be suffer'd to come near him.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	No, nor look'd on us.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Hail, sir! my lord, lend ear.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	I am a maid,
	My lord, that ne'er before invited eyes,
	But have been gaz'd on like a comet; she speaks,
	My lord, that, may be, hath endur'd a grief
	Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh'd.
	Though wayward Fortune did malign my state,
	My derivation was from ancestors
	Who stood equivalent with mighty kings;
	But time hath rooted out my parentage,
	And to the world and awkward casualties
	Bound me in servitude.—<STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> I will desist;
	But there is something glows upon my cheek,
	And whispers in mine ear, 'Go not till he speak.'
<SPEECH 47><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage,
	You would not do me violence.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	No, nor of any shores;
	Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am
	No other than I appear.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	Where I am but a stranger; from the deck
	You may discern the place.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	Should I tell my history, it would seem
	Like lies, disdain'd in the reporting.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	So indeed I did.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	Some such thing
	I said, and said no more but what my thoughts
	Did warrant me was likely.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	My name is Marina.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	Patience, good sir,
	Or here I'll cease.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	The name
	Was given me by one that had some power;
	My father, and a king.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	You said you would believe me;
	But, not to be a troubler of your peace,
	I will end here.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	Call'd Marina
	For I was born at sea.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	My mother was the daughter of a king;
	Who died the minute I was born,
	As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft
	Deliver'd weeping.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	You'll scorn to believe me; 'twere best I did give o'er.
<SPEECH 60><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	The king my father did in Tarsus leave me,
	Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,
	Did seek to murder me; and having woo'd
	A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do 't,
	A crew of pirates came and rescu'd me;
	Brought me to Mitylene. But, good sir,
	Whither will you have me? Why do you weep? It may be
	You think me an impostor; no, good faith;
	I am the daughter to King Pericles,
	If good King Pericles be.
<SPEECH 61><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	First, sir, I pray,
	What is your title?
<SPEECH 62><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	Is it no more to be your daughter than
	To say my mother's name was Thaisa?
	Thaisa was my mother, who did end
	The minute I began.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
	My heart
	Leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom.
