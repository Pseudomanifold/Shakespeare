	Peace, peace! and give experience tongue.
	They do abuse the king that flatter him;
	For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;
	The thing the which is flatter'd, but a spark,
	To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing;
	Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,
	Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err:
	When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,
	He flatters you, makes war upon your life.
	Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please;
	I cannot be much lower than my knees.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	An angry brow, dread lord.

	How dare the plants look up to heaven, from whence
	They have their nourishment?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	</STAGE DIR> I have ground the axe myself;
	Do you but strike the blow.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	To bear with patience
	Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
	Alas! sir.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
	Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak,
	Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,
	And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,
	Who either by public war or private treason
	Will take away your life.
	Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,
	Till that his rage and anger be forgot,
	Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.
	Your rule direct to any; if to me,
	Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><14%>
	We'll mingle our bloods together in the earth,
	From whence we had our being and our birth.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,
	Further to question me of your king's departure:
	His seal'd commission, left in trust with me,
	Doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	If further yet you will be satisfied,
	Why, as it were unlicens'd of your loves,
	He would depart, I'll give some light unto you.
	Being at Antioch—
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	Royal Antiochus—on what cause I know not—
	Took some displeasure at him, at least he judg'd so;
	And doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,
	To show his sorrow he'd correct himself;
	So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,
	With whom each minute threatens life or death.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	We have no reason to desire it,
	Commended to our master, not to us:
	Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,
	As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 4><37%>
	No, Escanes, know this of me,
	Antiochus from incest liv'd not free;
	For which, the most high gods not minding longer
	To withhold the vengeance that they had in store,
	Due to this heinous capital offence,
	Even in the height and pride of all his glory,
	When he was seated in a chariot
	Of an inestimable value, and his daughter with him,
	A fire from heaven came and shrivell'd up
	Their bodies, even to loathing; for they so stunk,
	That all those eyes ador'd them ere their fall
	Scorn now their hand should give them burial.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
	And yet but just; for though
	This king were great, his greatness was no guard
	To bar heaven's shaft, but sin had his reward.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
	With me? and welcome. Happy day, my lords.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	Your griefs! for what? wrong not the prince you love.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	For honour's cause forbear your suffrages:
	If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear.
	Take I your wish, I leap into the seas,
	Where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease.
	A twelvemonth longer, let me entreat you
	To forbear the absence of your king;
	If in which time expir'd he not return,
	I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.
	But if I cannot win you to this love,
	Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,
	And in your search spend your adventurous worth;
	Whom if you find, and win unto return,
	You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 4><40%>
	Then you love us, we you, and we'll clasp hands:
	When peers thus knit, a kingdom ever stands.

	That he have his. Call up some gentlemen.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	Gentlemen, there's some of worth would come aboard;
	I pray ye, greet them fairly.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	And you, sir, to outlive the age I am,
	And die as I would do.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	First, what is your place?
<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	Sir,
	Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the king;
	A man who for this three months hath not spoken
	To any one, nor taken sustenance
	But to prorogue his grief.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	'Twould be too tedious to repeat;
	But the main grief springs from the loss
	Of a beloved daughter and a wife.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	You may;
	But bootless is your sight: he will not speak
	To any.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	Behold him. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> This was a goodly person,
	Till the disaster that, one mortal night,
	Drove him to this.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	It is in vain; he will not speak to you.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	Sure, all's effectless; yet nothing we'll omit,
	That bears recovery's name. But, since your kindness
	We have stretch'd thus far, let us beseech you,
	That for our gold we may provision have,
	Wherein we are not destitute for want,
	But weary for the staleness.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	Sit, sir, I will recount it to you;
	But see, I am prevented.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	She's a gallant lady.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	Calls my lord?
<SPEECH 33><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	I know not; but
	Here is the regent, sir, of Mitylene,
	Speaks nobly of her.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	Sir, 'tis the governor of Mitylene,
	Who, hearing of your melancholy state,
	Did come to see you.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	My lord, I hear none.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
	Sir?
<SPEECH 37><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
	Hail, madam, and my queen!
