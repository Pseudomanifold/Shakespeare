	That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;
	For who digs hills because they do aspire
	Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.
	O my distressed lord! even such our griefs are;
	Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,
	But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 4><17%>
	I'll do my best, sir.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 4><18%>
	O! 'tis too true,
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 4><18%>
	Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
	O your sweet queen!
	That the strict fates had pleas'd you had brought her hither,
	To have bless'd mine eyes with her!
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
	I have one myself,
	Who shall not be more dear to my respect
	Than yours, my lord.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
	Thy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do 't:
	'Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.
	Thou canst not do a thing i' the world so soon,
	To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,
	Which is but cold, inflaming love i' thy bosom,
	Inflame too nicely; nor let pity, which
	Even women have cast off, melt thee, but he
	A soldier to thy purpose.

	The fitter, then, the gods should have her. Here
	She comes weeping for her only mistress' death.
	Thou art resolv'd?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
	How now, Marina! why do you keep alone?
	How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not
	Consume your blood with sorrowing; you have
	A nurse of me. Lord! how your favour's chang'd
	With this unprofitable woe. Come,
	Give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.
	Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there,
	And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come,
	Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
	Come, come;
	I love the king your father, and yourself,
	With more than foreign heart. We every day
	Expect him here; when he shall come and find
	Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,
	He will repent the breadth of his great voyage;
	Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken
	No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you;
	Walk, and be cheerful once again; reserve
	That excellent complexion, which did steal
	The eyes of young and old. Care not for me;
	I can go home alone.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	Come, come, I know 'tis good for you.
	Walk half an hour, Leonine, at least.
	Remember what I have said.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	I'll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while;
	Pray you walk softly, do not heat your blood:
	What! I must have care of you.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	I think
	You'll turn a child again.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,
	To foster it, nor ever to preserve.
	She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?
	Unless you play the pious innocent,
	And for an honest attribute cry out
	'She died by foul play.'
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	Be one of those that think
	The pretty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,
	And open this to Pericles. I do shame
	To think of what a noble strain you are,
	And of how coward a spirit.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
	Be it so, then;
	Yet none does know but you how she came dead,
	Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.
	She did distain my child, and stood between
	Her and her fortunes; none would look on her,
	But cast their gazes on Marina's face,
	Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
	Not worth the time of day. It pierc'd me thorough;
	And though you call my course unnatural,
	You not your child well loving, yet I find
	It greets me as an enterprise of kindness
	Perform'd to your sole daughter.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
	And as for Pericles,
	What should he say? We wept after her hearse,
	And even yet we mourn; her monument
	Is almost finish'd, and her epitaphs
	In glittering golden characters express
	A general praise to her, and care in us
	At whose expense 'tis done.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
	You are like one that superstitiously
	Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies;
	But yet I know you'll do as I advise.
	Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short;
	Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for 't;
	Making—to take your imagination—
	From bourn to bourn, region to region.
	By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime
	To use one language in each several clime
	Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you
	To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,
	The stages of our story. Pericles
	Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,
	Attended on by many a lord and knight,
	To see his daughter, all his life's delight.
	Old Helicanus goes along. Behind
	Is left to govern it, you bear in mind,
	Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late
	Advanc'd in time to great and high estate.
	Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought
	This king to Tarsus, think his pilot thought,
	So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,
	To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.
	Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;
	Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.
	See how belief may suffer by foul show!
	This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;
	And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,
	With sighs shot through, and biggest tears o'ershower'd,
	Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears
	Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs;
	He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears
	A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,
	And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit
	The epitaph is for Marina writ
	By wicked Dionyza.
	the fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,
	who wither'd in her spring of year:
	she was of tyrus the king's daughter,
	on whom foul death hath made this slaughter.
	marina was she call'd; and at her birth,
	thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:
	therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,
	hath thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:
	wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,
	make raging battery upon shores of flint.
	No visor does become black villany
	So well as soft and tender flattery.
	Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,
	And bear his courses to be ordered
	By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play
	His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day
	In her unholy service. Patience then,
	And think you now are all in Mitylen.
