	Young Prince of Tyre, you have at large receiv'd

	Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,
	For the embracements even of Jove himself;
	At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,
	Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,
	The senate-house of planets all did sit,
	To knit in her their best perfections.

	Prince Pericles,â€”
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,
	With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd;
	For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:
	Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view
	Her countless glory, which desert must gain;
	And which, without desert, because thine eye
	Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.
	Yon sometime famous princes, like thyself,
	Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,
	Tell thee with speechless tongues and semblance pale,
	That without covering, save yon field of stars,
	They here stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;
	And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
	For going on death's net, whom none resist.

	Scorning advice, read the conclusion then;
	Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,

	Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life,
	For that's an article within our law,
	As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expir'd:
	Either expound now or receive your sentence.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	</STAGE DIR> Heaven! that I had thy head; he has found the meaning;
	But I will gloze with him. Young Prince of Tyre,
	Though by the tenour of our strict edict,
	Your exposition misinterpreting,
	We might proceed to cancel of your days;
	Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree
	As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:
	Forty days longer we do respite you;
	If by which time our secret be undone,
	This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son:
	And until then your entertain shall be
	As doth befit our honour and your worth.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	He hath found the meaning, for which we mean
	To take his head.
	He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,
	Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
	In such a loathed manner;
	And therefore instantly this prince must die,
	For by his fall my honour must keep high.
	Who attends us there?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	Thaliard,
	You're of our chamber, and our mind partakes
	Her private actions to your secrecy;
	And for your faithfulness we will advance you.
	Thaliard, behold, here's poison, and here's gold;
	We hate the Prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:
	It fits thee not to ask the reason why,
	Because we bid it. Say, is it done?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	Enough.
	Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	</STAGE DIR> As thou
	Wilt live, fly after; and, as an arrow shot
	From a well-experienc'd archer hits the mark
	His eye doth level at, so thou ne'er return
	Unless thou say 'Prince Pericles is dead.'
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	Thaliard, adieu!
	Till Pericles be dead,
	My heart can lend no succour to my head.
