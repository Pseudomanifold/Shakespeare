	Good morrow to your lordship.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	That is the cause we trouble you so early;
	'Tis not our husbandry.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
	Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth
	Your charity, and hundreds call themselves
	Your creatures, who by you have been restor'd:
	And not your knowledge, your personal pain, but even
	Your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon
	Such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
	'Tis like a coffin, sir.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
	'Tis so, my lord.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
	A delicate odour.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	Most likely, sir.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	Is not this strange?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
	No, nor never shall do in such a place as this, she being once gone.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
	No, no. Come, I am for no more bawdy-houses. Shall's go hear the vestals sing?
