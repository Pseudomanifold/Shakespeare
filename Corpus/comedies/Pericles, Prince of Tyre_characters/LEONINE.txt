	I warrant you, madam.

	These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes;
	And they have seiz'd Marina. Let her go;
	There's no hope she'll return. I'll swear she's dead,
	And thrown into the sea. But I'll see further;
	Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,
	Not carry her aboard. If she remain,
	Whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.
