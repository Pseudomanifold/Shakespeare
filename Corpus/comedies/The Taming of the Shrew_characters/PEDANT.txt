	God save you, sir!
<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 2><70%>
	Sir, at the furthest for a week or two;
	But then up further, and as far as Rome;
	And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 2><70%>
	Of Mantua.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 2><70%>
	My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 2><71%>
	Alas, sir! it is worse for me than so;
	For I have bills for money by exchange
	From Florence, and must here deliver them.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 2><71%>
	Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been;
	Pisa, renowned for grave citizens.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 2><71%>
	I know him not, but I have heard of him;
	A merchant of incomparable wealth.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 2><72%>
	O sir, I do; and will repute you ever
	The patron of my life and liberty.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 4><79%>
	Ay, what else? and, but I be deceived,
	Signior Baptista may remember me,
	Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,
	Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>
	I warrant you. But, sir, here comes your boy;
	'Twere good he were school'd.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>
	Soft, son!
	Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua
	To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
	Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
	Of love between your daughter and himself:
	And,—for the good report I hear of you,
	And for the love he beareth to your daughter,
	And she to him,—to stay him not too long,
	I am content, in a good father's care,
	To have him match'd; and, if you please to like
	No worse than I, upon some agreement
	Me shall you find ready and willing
	With one consent to have her so bestow'd;
	For curious I cannot be with you,
	Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall need none so long as I live.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	Thou liest: his father is come from Padua, and here looking out at the window.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	Lay hands on the villain: I believe, a' means to cozen somebody in this city under my countenance.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!
<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio; and he is mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	Swear, if thou darest.
