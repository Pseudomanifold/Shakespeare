	Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight
	Adonis painted by a running brook,
	And Cytherea all in sedges hid,

	Even as the waving sedges play with wind.

	O, how we joy to see your wit restor'd!
	O, that once more you knew but what you are!
	These fifteen years you have been in a dream,
	Or, when you wak'd, so wak'd as if you slept.
