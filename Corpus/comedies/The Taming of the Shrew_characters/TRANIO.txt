	Mi perdonate, gentle master mine,
	I am in all affected as yourself,
	Glad that you thus continue your resolve
	To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
	Only, good master, while we do admire
	This virtue and this moral discipline,
	Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
	Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
	As Ovid be an outcast quite abjur'd.
	Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,
	And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
	Music and poesy use to quicken you;
	The mathematics and the metaphysics,
	Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;
	No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en;
	In brief, sir, study what you most affect.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><13%>
	Master, some show to welcome us to town.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><14%>
	Hush, master! here is some good pastime toward:
	That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><14%>
	Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><16%>
	I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
	That love should of a sudden take such hold?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><17%>
	Master, it is no time to chide you now;
	Affection is not rated from the heart:
	If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,
	Redime te captum, quam queas minimo.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><17%>
	Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,
	Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><17%>
	Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister
	Began to scold and raise up such a storm
	That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><18%>
	Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
	I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,
	Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
	Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd,
	That till the father rid his hands of her,
	Master, your love must live a maid at home;
	And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
	Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><18%>
	Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><18%>
	Master, for my hand,
	Both our inventions meet and jump in one.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><18%>
	You will be schoolmaster,
	And undertake the teaching of the maid:
	That's your device.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><18%>
	Not possible; for who shall bear your part,
	And be in Padua here Vincentio's son?
	Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends;
	Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 1><19%>
	So had you need.
	In brief then, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
	And I am tied to be obedient;
	For so your father charg'd me at our parting,
	'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,
	Although I think 'twas in another sense:
	I am content to be Lucentio,
	Because so well I love Lucentio.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 1><20%>
	So would I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
	That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
	But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise
	You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
	When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
	But in all places else your master, Lucentio.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 2><28%>
	Gentlemen, God save you! If I may be bold,
	Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
	To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 2><29%>
	Even he, Biondello!
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 2><29%>
	Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 2><29%>
	I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 2><29%>
	And if I be, sir, is it any offence?
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 2><29%>
	Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
	For me as for you?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 2><29%>
	For what reason, I beseech you?
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 2><29%>
	Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,
	Do me this right; hear me with patience.
	Baptista is a noble gentleman,
	To whom my father is not all unknown;
	And were his daughter fairer than she is,
	She may more suitors have, and me for one.
	Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
	Then well one more may fair Bianca have,
	And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,
	Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 2><30%>
	No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,
	The one as famous for a scolding tongue
	As is the other for beauteous modesty.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 2><30%>
	If it be so, sir, that you are the man
	Must stead us all, and me among the rest;
	And if you break the ice, and do this feat,
	Achieve the elder, set the younger free
	For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
	Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 2><30%>
	Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,
	Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
	And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,
	And do as adversaries do in law,
	Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 1><34%>
	Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
	That, being a stranger in this city here,
	Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
	Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
	Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
	In the preferment of the eldest sister.
	This liberty is all that I request,
	That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
	I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo,
	And free access and favour as the rest:
	And, toward the education of your daughters,
	I here bestow a simple instrument,
	And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
	If you accept them, then their worth is great.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 1><35%>
	Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 1><42%>
	Is this your speeding? nay then, good night our part!
<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 1><43%>
	Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 1><43%>
	'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
	'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 1><44%>
	And I am one that love Bianca more
	Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 1><44%>
	Greybeard, thy love doth freeze.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 1><44%>
	But youth in ladies eyes that flourisheth.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 1><45%>
	That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
	I am my father's heir and only son:
	If I may have your daughter to my wife,
	I'll leave her houses three or four as good,
	Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
	Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
	Besides two thousand ducats by the year
	Of fruitful land, all of which shall be her jointure.
	What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?
<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 1><45%>
	Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
	Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses,
	And twelve tight galleys; these I will assure her,
	And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 1><45%>
	Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
	By your firm promise. Gremio is out-vied.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 1><46%>
	That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 1><46%>
	A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!
	Yet I have fac'd it with a card of ten.
	'Tis in my head to do my master good:
	I see no reason, but suppos'd Lucentio
	Must get a father, called 'suppos'd Vincentio;'
	And that's a wonder: fathers, commonly
	Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,
	A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	Patience, good Katharine, and Baptista too.
	Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
	Whatever fortune stays him from his word:
	Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
	Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
	But, say, what to thine old news?
<SPEECH 42><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
	Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	Not so well apparell'd
	As I wish you were.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	And tell us what occasion of import
	Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,
	And sent you hither so unlike yourself?
<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	See not your bride in these unreverent robes:
	Go to my chamber; put on clothes of mine.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	He hath some meaning in his mad attire.
	We will persuade him, be it possible,
	To put on better ere he go to church.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	But to her love concerneth us to add
	Her father's liking: which to bring to pass,
	As I before imparted to your worship,
	I am to get a man,—whate'er he be
	It skills not much, we'll fit him to our turn,—
	And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa,
	And make assurance here in Padua,
	Of greater sums than I have promised.
	So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,
	And marry sweet Bianca with consent.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	That by degrees we mean to look into,
	And watch our vantage in this business.
	We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
	The narrow-prying father, Minola,
	The quaint musician, amorous Licio;
	All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
	Signior Gremio, came you from the church?
<SPEECH 49><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
	And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
<SPEECH 50><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
	Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
	Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
	What said the wench when he arose again?
<SPEECH 53><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
	Of all mad matches never was the like.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
	Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?
<SPEECH 56><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
	Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
	I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
	I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
	Of your entire affection to Bianca;
	And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
	I will with you, if you be so contented,
	Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	And here I take the like unfeigned oath,
	Never to marry with her though she would entreat.
	Fie on her! see how beastly she doth court him.
<SPEECH 60><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
	Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
	As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
	Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
	And have forsworn you with Hortensio.
<SPEECH 61><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
	Mistress, we have.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
	I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now, That shall be woo'd and wedded in a day.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
	Ay, and he'll tame her.
<SPEECH 64><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
	Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.
<SPEECH 65><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
	Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;
	That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
	To tame a shrew, and charm her chattering tongue.
<SPEECH 66><ACT 4><SCENE 2><70%>
	What is he, Biondello?
<SPEECH 67><ACT 4><SCENE 2><70%>
	If he be credulous and trust my tale,
	I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
	And give assurance to Baptista Minola,
	As if he were the right Vincentio.
	Take in your love, and then let me alone.
<SPEECH 68><ACT 4><SCENE 2><70%>
	And you, sir! you are welcome.
	Travel you far on, or are you at the furthest?
<SPEECH 69><ACT 4><SCENE 2><70%>
	What countryman, I pray?
<SPEECH 70><ACT 4><SCENE 2><70%>
	Of Mantua, sir! marry, God forbid!
	And come to Padua, careless of your life?
<SPEECH 71><ACT 4><SCENE 2><70%>
	'Tis death for any one in Mantua
	To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
	Your ships are stay'd at Venice; and the duke,—
	For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,—
	Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly.
	'Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come,
	You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.
<SPEECH 72><ACT 4><SCENE 2><71%>
	Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
	This will I do, and this I will advise you:
	First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?
<SPEECH 73><ACT 4><SCENE 2><71%>
	Among them, know you one Vincentio?
<SPEECH 74><ACT 4><SCENE 2><71%>
	He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
	In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.
<SPEECH 75><ACT 4><SCENE 2><71%>
	To save your life in this extremity,
	This favour will I do you for his sake;
	And think it not the worst of all your fortunes
	That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
	His name and credit shall you undertake,
	And in my house you shall be friendly lodg'd,
	Look that you take upon you as you should!
	You understand me, sir; so shall you stay
	Till you have done your business in the city.
	If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.
<SPEECH 76><ACT 4><SCENE 2><72%>
	Then go with me to make the matter good.
	This, by the way, I let you understand:
	My father is here look'd for every day,
	To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
	'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:
	In all these circumstances I'll instruct you.
	Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.
<SPEECH 77><ACT 4><SCENE 4><79%>
	Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?
<SPEECH 78><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>
	'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
	With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.
<SPEECH 79><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>
	Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
	Now do your duty throughly, I advise you:
	Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.
<SPEECH 80><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>
	But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
<SPEECH 81><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>
	Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.
	Here comes Baptista. Set your countenance, sir.
	Signior Baptista, you are happily met.
	</STAGE DIR> Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:
	I pray you, stand good father to me now,
	Give me Bianca for my patrimony.
<SPEECH 82><ACT 4><SCENE 4><81%>
	I thank you, sir. Where, then, do you know best
	We be affied and such assurance ta'en
	As shall with either part's agreement stand?
<SPEECH 83><ACT 4><SCENE 4><81%>
	Then at my lodging an it like you:
	There doth my father lie, and there this night
	We'll pass the business privately and well.
	Send for your daughter by your servant here;
	My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
	The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,
	You're like to have a thin and slender pittance.
<SPEECH 84><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
	Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
	Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer.
	Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.
<SPEECH 85><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?
<SPEECH 86><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	How now! what's the matter?
<SPEECH 87><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir, what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.
<SPEECH 88><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	Call forth an officer.
	Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista, I charge you see that he be forthcoming.
<SPEECH 89><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	Then thou wert best say, that I am not Lucentio.
<SPEECH 90><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	O sir! Lucentio slipp'd me, like his greyhound,
	Which runs himself, and catches for his master.
<SPEECH 91><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:
	'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
