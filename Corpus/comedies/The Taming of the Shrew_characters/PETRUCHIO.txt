	Verona, for awhile I take my leave,
	To see my friends in Padua; but, of all
	My best beloved and approved friend,
	Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
	Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><21%>
	Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><21%>
	Villain, I say, knock me at this gate;
	And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><21%>
	Will it not be?
	Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
	I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><21%>
	Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><21%>
	Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
	Con tutto il cuore ben trovato, may I say.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 2><22%>
	A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
	I bade the rascal knock upon your gate,
	And could not get him for my heart to do it.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><22%>
	Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 2><22%>
	Such wind as scatters young men through the world
	To seek their fortunes further than at home,
	Where small experience grows. But in a few,
	Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
	Antonio, my father, is deceas'd,
	And I have thrust myself into this maze,
	Haply to wive and thrive as best I may.
	Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
	And so am come abroad to see the world.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 2><23%>
	Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we,
	Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
	One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
	As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
	Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
	As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd
	As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,
	She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
	Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
	As are the swelling Adriatic seas:
	I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
	If wealthily, then happily in Padua.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 2><24%>
	Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:
	Tell me her father's name, and 'tis enough;
	For I will board her, though she chide as loud
	As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 2><24%>
	I know her father, though I know not her;
	And he knew my deceased father well.
	I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
	And therefore let me be thus bold with you,
	To give you over at this first encounter,
	Unless you will accompany me thither.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 2><26%>
	Peace, sirrah!
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 2><27%>
	I know she is an irksome, brawling scold:
	If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 2><27%>
	Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:
	My father dead, my fortune lives for me;
	And I do hope good days and long to see.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 2><27%>
	Will I live?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 2><28%>
	Why came I hither but to that intent?
	Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
	Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
	Have I not heard the sea, puff'd up with winds,
	Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
	Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
	And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
	Have I not in a pitched battle heard
	Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
	And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
	That gives not half so great a blow to hear
	As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
	Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 2><29%>
	Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 2><30%>
	Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 2><30%>
	Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 2><30%>
	Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:
	The youngest daughter, whom you hearken for,
	Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
	And will not promise her to any man
	Until the elder sister first be wed;
	The younger then is free, and not before.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>
	And you, good sir. Pray, have you not a daughter
	Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>
	You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.
	I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
	That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
	Her affability and bashful modesty,
	Her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour,
	Am bold to show myself a forward guest
	Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
	Of that report which I so oft have heard.
	And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
	I do present you with a man of mine,
	Cunning in music and the mathematics,
	To instruct her fully in those sciences,
	Whereof I know she is not ignorant.
	Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:
	His name is Licio, born in Mantua.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>
	I see you do not mean to part with her,
	Or else you like not of my company.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 1><34%>
	Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son;
	A man well known throughout all Italy.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 1><34%>
	O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 1><35%>
	Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
	And every day I cannot come to woo.
	You knew my father well, and in him me,
	Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
	Which I have better'd rather than decreas'd:
	Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
	What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 1><36%>
	And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of
	Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
	In all my lands and leases whatsoever.
	Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,
	That covenants may be kept on either hand.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 1><36%>
	Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, father,
	I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
	And where two raging fires meet together
	They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
	Though little fire grows great with little wind,
	Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all;
	So I to her, and so she yields to me;
	For I am rough and woo not like a babe.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 1><36%>
	Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,
	That shake not, though they blow perpetually.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 1><37%>
	Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench!
	I love her ten times more than e'er I did:
	O! how I long to have some chat with her!
<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 1><37%>
	I pray you do; I will attend her here,
	And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
	Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain
	She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
	Say that she frown; I'll say she looks as clear
	As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:
	Say she be mute and will not speak a word;
	Then I'll commend her volubility,
	And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
	If she do bid me pack; I'll give her thanks,
	As though she bid me stay by her a week:
	If she deny to wed; I'll crave the day
	When I shall ask the banns, and when be married.
	But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.
	Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 1><38%>
	You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,
	And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst;
	But, Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom;
	Kate of Kate-Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
	For dainties are all cates: and therefore, Kate,
	Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;
	Hearing thy mildness prais'd in every town,
	Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,—
	Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,—
	Myself am mov'd to woo thee for my wife.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 1><39%>
	Why, what's a moveable?
<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 1><39%>
	Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.

	Women are made to bear, and so are you.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 1><39%>
	Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;

<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 1><39%>
	Should be! should buz!
<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 1><39%>

	Come, come, you wasp; i' faith you are too angry.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 1><39%>
	My remedy is, then, to pluck it out.

	What! with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again.
	Good Kate, I am a gentleman.

	I swear I'll cuff you if you strike again.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 2><SCENE 1><40%>

	Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 2><SCENE 1><40%>
	Why, here's no crab, and therefore look not sour.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 2><SCENE 1><40%>
	Then show it me.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 2><SCENE 1><40%>
	What, you mean my face?
<SPEECH 52><ACT 2><SCENE 1><40%>
	Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 2><SCENE 1><40%>
	'Tis with cares.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 2><SCENE 1><40%>
	Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth, you 'scape not so.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 2><SCENE 1><40%>
	No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.
	'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,
	And now I find report a very liar;
	For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
	But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:
	Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
	Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will;
	Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk;
	But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
	With gentle conference, soft and affable.
	Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
	O slanderous world! Kate, like the hazel-twig,
	Is straight and slender, and as brown in hue
	As hazel nuts, and sweeter than the kernels.
	O! let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.

	Did ever Dian so become a grove

<SPEECH 57><ACT 2><SCENE 1><41%>
	It is extempore, from my mother-wit.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 2><SCENE 1><41%>
	Am I not wise?
<SPEECH 59><ACT 2><SCENE 1><41%>
	Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharine, in thy bed:
	And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
	Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
	That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
	And will you, nill you, I will marry you.
	Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
	For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,—
	Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,—
	Thou must be married to no man but me:
	For I am he am born to tame you, Kate;
	And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
	Conformable as other household Kates.
	Here comes your father: never make denial;
	I must and will have Katharine to my wife.
<SPEECH 60><ACT 2><SCENE 1><42%>
	How but well, sir? how but well?
	It were impossible I should speed amiss.
<SPEECH 61><ACT 2><SCENE 1><42%>
	Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,
	That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:
	If she be curst, it is for policy,
	For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
	She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
	For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
	And Roman Lucrece for her chastity;
	And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,
	That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 2><SCENE 1><42%>
	Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself:
	If she and I be pleas'd, what's that to you?
	'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
	That she shall still be curst in company.
	I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe
	How much she loves me: O! the kindest Kate.
	She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss
	She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
	That in a twink she won me to her love.
	O! you are novices: 'tis a world to see,
	How tame, when men and women are alone,
	A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
	Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice
	To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
	Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
	I will be sure my Katharine shall be fine.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 2><SCENE 1><43%>
	Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.
	I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:
	We will have rings, and things, and fine array;
	And, kiss me, Kate, we will be married o' Sunday.
<SPEECH 64><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	Come, where be these gallants? who is at home?
<SPEECH 65><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	And yet I come not well.
<SPEECH 66><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	Were it better, I should rush in thus.
	But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?
	How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:
	And wherefore gaze this goodly company,
	As if they saw some wondrous monument,
	Some comet, or unusual prodigy?
<SPEECH 67><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:
	Sufficeth, I am come to keep my word,
	Though in some part enforced to digress;
	Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse
	As you shall well be satisfied withal.
	But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:
	The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.
<SPEECH 68><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.
<SPEECH 69><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:
	To me she's married, not unto my clothes.
	Could I repair what she will wear in me
	As I can change these poor accoutrements,
	'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
	But what a fool am I to chat with you
	When I should bid good morrow to my bride,
	And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
<SPEECH 70><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains:
	I know you think to dine with me to-day,
	And have prepar'd great store of wedding cheer;
	But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,
	And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
<SPEECH 71><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	I must away to-day, before night come.
	Make it no wonder: if you knew my business,
	You would entreat me rather go than stay.
	And, honest company, I thank you all,
	That have beheld me give away myself
	To this most patient, sweet, and virtuous wife.
	Dine with my father, drink a health to me,
	For I must hence; and farewell to you all.
<SPEECH 72><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	It may not be.
<SPEECH 73><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>

	O Kate! content thee: prithee, be not angry.
<SPEECH 78><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
	Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
	Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
	Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,
	Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves:
	But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
	Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
	I will be master of what is mine own.
	She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,
	My household stuff, my field, my barn,
	My horse, my ox, my ass, my anything;
	And here she stands, touch her whoever dare;
	I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
	That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,
	Draw forth thy weapon, we're beset with thieves;
	Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
	Fear not, sweet wench; they shall not touch thee, Kate:
	I'll buckler thee against a million.
<SPEECH 79><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>

	Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.
	Where is the life that late I led?

	Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains! When?
	It was the friar of orders grey,
	As he forth walked on his way:
	Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:
	Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.
	Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho!
	Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence
	And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:
	One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted with.
	Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?
	Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.—
	You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?
<SPEECH 83><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	A whoreson, beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
	Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.
	Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I?—
	What's this? mutton?
<SPEECH 84><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	Who brought it?
<SPEECH 85><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
	What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?
	How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser,
	And serve it thus to me that love it not?
	There, take it to you, trenchers, cups, and all.
	You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
	What! do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.
<SPEECH 86><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
	I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away;
	And I expressly am forbid to touch it,
	For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
	And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
	Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
	Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
	Be patient; to-morrow't shall be mended,
	And for this night we'll fast for company:
	Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.
<SPEECH 87><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
	Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
	And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
	My falcon now is sharp and passing empty,
	And till she stoop she must not be full-gorg'd,
	For then she never looks upon her lure.
	Another way I have to man my haggard,
	To make her come and know her keeper's call;
	That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
	That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
	She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
	Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not:
	As with the meat, some undeserved fault
	I'll find about the making of the bed;
	And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
	This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:
	Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
	That all is done in reverend care of her;
	And in conclusion she shall watch all night:
	And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl,
	And with the clamour keep her still awake.
	This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;
	And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
	He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
	Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.

	How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?

	And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
	Here, take away this dish.
<SPEECH 90><ACT 4><SCENE 3><74%>

	Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!

	Will we return unto thy father's house,
	And revel it as bravely as the best,
	With silken coats and caps and golden rings,
	With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things;
	With scarfs and fans and double change of bravery,
	With amber bracelets, beads and all this knavery.
	What! hast thou din'd? The tailor stays thy leisure,
	To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.
	Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments;
	Lay forth the gown.—
	What news with you, sir?
<SPEECH 92><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
	A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:

	Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.
<SPEECH 93><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	When you are gentle, you shall have one too;
	And not till then.
<SPEECH 94><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>

	Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't.
	O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
	What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon:
	What! up and down, carv'd like an apple-tart?
	Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
	Like to a censer in a barber's shop.
	Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?
<SPEECH 96><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
	Marry, and did: but if you be remember'd,
	I did not bid you mar it to the time.
	Go, hop me over every kennel home,
	For you shall hop without my custom, sir.
	I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.
<SPEECH 97><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
	Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.
<SPEECH 98><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
	O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,
	Thou thimble,
	Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
	Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
	Brav'd in mine own house with a skein of thread!
	Away! thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant,
	Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard
	As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv'st!
	I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.
<SPEECH 99><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	Read it.
<SPEECH 100><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	Proceed.
<SPEECH 101><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	Ay, there's the villany.
<SPEECH 102><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.
<SPEECH 103><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
<SPEECH 104><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?
<SPEECH 105><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	</STAGE DIR> Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.
	</STAGE DIR> Go take it hence; be gone, and say no more.
<SPEECH 106><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's,
	Even in these honest mean habiliments.
	Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor:
	For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
	And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
	So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
	What is the jay more precious than the lark
	Because his feathers are more beautiful?
	Or is the adder better than the eel
	Because his painted skin contents the eye?
	O, no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
	For this poor furniture and mean array.
	If thou account'st it shame, lay it on me;
	And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,
	To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
	Go, call my men, and let us straight to him;
	And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
	There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.
	Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
	And well we may come there by dinner-time.
<SPEECH 107><ACT 4><SCENE 3><79%>
	It shall be seven ere I go to horse.
	Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,
	You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:
	I will not go to-day; and ere I do,
	It shall be what o'clock I say it is.
<SPEECH 108><ACT 4><SCENE 5><83%>
	Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's.
	Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
<SPEECH 109><ACT 4><SCENE 5><83%>
	I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
<SPEECH 110><ACT 4><SCENE 5><84%>
	Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,
	It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
	Or ere I journey to your father's house.
	Go one and fetch our horses back again.
	Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!
<SPEECH 111><ACT 4><SCENE 5><84%>
	I say it is the moon.
<SPEECH 112><ACT 4><SCENE 5><84%>
	Nay, then you lie; it is the blessed sun.
<SPEECH 113><ACT 4><SCENE 5><84%>
	Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
	And not unluckily against the bias.
	But soft! what company is coming here?
	</STAGE DIR> Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away?
	Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
	Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
	Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
	What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,
	As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
	Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
	Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.
<SPEECH 114><ACT 4><SCENE 5><85%>
	Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:
	This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,
	And not a maiden, as thou sayst he is.
<SPEECH 115><ACT 4><SCENE 5><85%>
	Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known
	Which way thou travellest: if along with us,
	We shall be joyful of thy company.
<SPEECH 116><ACT 4><SCENE 5><85%>
	What is his name?
<SPEECH 117><ACT 4><SCENE 5><86%>
	Happily met; the happier for thy son.
	And now by law, as well as reverend age,
	I may entitle thee my loving father:
	The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
	Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
	Nor be not griev'd: she is of good esteem,
	Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth;
	Beside, so qualified as may beseem
	The spouse of any noble gentleman.
	Let me embrace with old Vincentio;
	And wander we to see thy honest son,
	Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.
<SPEECH 118><ACT 4><SCENE 5><86%>
	Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;
	For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.
<SPEECH 119><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:
	My father's bears more toward the marketplace;
	Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.
<SPEECH 120><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua. Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances, I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.
<SPEECH 121><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	</STAGE DIR> Why, how now, gentleman! why, this is flat knavery, to take upon you another man's name.
<SPEECH 122><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside, and see the end of this controversy.
<SPEECH 123><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	First kiss me, Kate, and we will.
<SPEECH 124><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	What! art thou ashamed of me?
<SPEECH 125><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.
<SPEECH 126><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
	Better once than never, for never too late.
<SPEECH 127><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
<SPEECH 128><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	Padua affords nothing but what is kind.
<SPEECH 129><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.
<SPEECH 130><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
	I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.
<SPEECH 131><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	Roundly replied.
<SPEECH 132><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?
<SPEECH 133><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.
<SPEECH 134><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	To her, Kate!
<SPEECH 135><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.
<SPEECH 136><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	Spoke like an officer: ha' to thee, lad.
<SPEECH 137><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	Nay, that you shall not; since you have begun,
	Have at you for a bitter jest or two.
<SPEECH 138><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio;
	This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not:
	Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.
<SPEECH 139><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	A good swift simile, but something currish.
<SPEECH 140><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;
	And, as the jest did glance away from me,
	'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
<SPEECH 141><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	Well, I say no: and therefore, for assurance,
	Let's each one send unto his wife;
	And he whose wife is most obedient
	To come at first when he doth send for her,
	Shall win the wager which we will propose.
<SPEECH 142><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	Twenty crowns!
	I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
	But twenty times so much upon my wife.
<SPEECH 143><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	A match! 'tis done.
<SPEECH 144><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
	How! she is busy, and she cannot come!
	Is that an answer?
<SPEECH 145><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
	I hope, better.
<SPEECH 146><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
	O ho! entreat her!
	Nay, then she must needs come.
<SPEECH 147><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
	Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
	Intolerable, not to be endur'd!
	Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress; say,
	I command her come to me.
<SPEECH 148><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
	What?
<SPEECH 149><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
	The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
<SPEECH 150><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
	Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?
<SPEECH 151><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
	Go, fetch them hither: if they deny to come,
	Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands.
	Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.
<SPEECH 152><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
	Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life,
	An awful rule and right supremacy;
	And, to be short, what not that's sweet and happy.
<SPEECH 153><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
	Nay, I will win my wager better yet,
	And show more sign of her obedience,
	Her new-built virtue and obedience.
	See where she comes, and brings your froward wives
	As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
	Katharine, that cap of yours becomes you not:
	Off with that bauble, throw it under foot.
<SPEECH 154><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
	Katharine, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women
	What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
<SPEECH 155><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
	Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
<SPEECH 156><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
	I say she shall: and first begin with her.
<SPEECH 157><ACT 5><SCENE 2><99%>
	Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.
<SPEECH 158><ACT 5><SCENE 2><100%>
	Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
	We three are married, but you two are sped.
	'Twas I won the wager, <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> though you hit the white;
	And, being a winner, God give you good night!
