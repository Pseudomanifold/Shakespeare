	Very reverend sport, truly: and done in the testimony of a good conscience.

	Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly varied, like a scholar at the least: but, sir, I assure ye, it was a buck of the first head.

	Sir, he hath not fed of the dainties that are bred of a book;
	he hath not eat paper, as it were; he hath not drunk ink: his intellect is not replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible in the duller parts:
	And such barren plants are set before us, that we thankful should be,
	Which we of taste and feeling are, for those parts that do fructify in us more than he;
	For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool:
	So, were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school:
	But, omne bene, say I; being of an old Father's mind,
	Many can brook the weather that love not the wind.

	A title to Phœbe, to Luna, to the moon.

	Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge; so it shall please you to abrogate scurrility.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 2><42%>
	A rare talent!
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 2><42%>
	Sir, I praise the Lord for you, and so may my parishioners; for their sons are well tutored by you, and their daughters profit very greatly under you: you are a good member of the commonwealth.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 2><44%>
	Ay, sir, and very learned.

	If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?
	Ah! never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow'd;
	Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll faithful prove;
	Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like osiers bow'd
	Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes.
	Where all those pleasures live that art would comprehend:
	If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice
	Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend;
	All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
	Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire
	Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,
	Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.
	Celestial as thou art, O! pardon love this wrong.
	That sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue!

	Sir, you have done this in the fear of God, very religiously; and, as a certain Father saith—
<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 2><45%>
	Marvellous well for the pen.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 2><46%>
	And thank you too; for society—saith the text—is the happiness of life.

	I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at dinner have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without impudency, learned without opinion, and strange without heresy. I did converse this quondam day with a companion of the king's, who is intituled, nominated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.

	When in the world I liv'd, I was the world's commander;
