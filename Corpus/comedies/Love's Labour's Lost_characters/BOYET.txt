	Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:
	Consider whom the king your father sends,
	To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:
	Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
	To parley with the sole inheritor
	Of all perfections that a man may owe,
	Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
	Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
	Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
	As Nature was in making graces dear
	When she did starve the general world beside,
	And prodigally gave them all to you.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><18%>
	Proud of employment, willingly I go.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
	Navarre had notice of your fair approach;
	And he and his competitors in oath
	Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,
	Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt;
	He rather means to lodge you in the field,
	Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
	Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
	To let you enter his unpeeled house.
	Here comes Navarre.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	So please your Grace, the packet is not come
	Where that and other specialties are bound:
	To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	The heir of Alençon, Katharine her name.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	She hath but one for herself; to desire that, were a shame.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Her mother's, I have heard.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Good sir, be not offended.
	She is an heir of Falconbridge.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Not unlike, sir; that may be.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Rosaline, by good hap.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	To her will, sir, or so.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	And every jest but a word.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	I was as willing to grapple, as he was to board.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	And wherefore not ships?
	No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	So you grant pasture for me.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	Belonging to whom?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	If my observation,—which very seldom lies,—
	By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,
	Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	With that which we lovers entitle affected.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	Why, all his behaviours did make their retire
	To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire;
	His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,
	Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:
	His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
	Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
	All senses to that sense did make their repair,
	To feel only looking on fairest of fair,
	Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
	As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
	Who, tend'ring their own worth from where they were glass'd,
	Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd.
	His face's own margent did quote such amazes,
	That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
	I'll give you Aquitaine, and all that is his,
	An' you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	But to speak that in words which his eye hath disclos'd.
	I only have made a mouth of his eye,
	By adding a tongue which I know will not he.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	Do you hear, my mad wenches?
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	What, then, do you see?
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	You are too hard for me.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 1><34%>
	I know not; but I think it was not he.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 1><35%>
	Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty

	Here comes a member of the commonwealth.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 1><36%>
	I am bound to serve.
	This letter is mistook; it importeth none here:
	It is writ to Jaquenetta.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 1><36%>
	By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible; true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar Zenelophon, and he it was that might rightly say veni, vidi, vici; which to anatomize in the vulgar—O base and obscure vulgar!—videlicet, he came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw, two; overcame, three. Who came? the king: Why did he come? to see: Why did he see? to overcome: To whom came he? to the beggar: What saw he? the beggar. Whom overcame he? the beggar. The conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's; the captive is enriched: on whose side? the beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose side? the king's, no, on both in one, or one in both. I am the king, for so stands the comparison; thou the beggar, for so witnesseth thy lowliness. Shall I command thy love? I may: Shall I enforce thy love? I could: Shall I entreat thy love? I will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes; for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus, expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot, my eyes on thy picture, and my heart on thy every part.
	Thine, in the dearest design of Industry, DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.
	Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
	'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey:
	Submissive fall his princely feet before,
	And he from forage will incline to play.
	But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?
	Food for his rage, repasture for his den.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 1><37%>
	I am much deceiv'd but I remember the style.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 1><37%>
	This Armado is a Spaniard, that keeps here in court;
	A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
	To the prince and his book-mates.

	So may I answer thee with one as old, that was a woman when Queen Guinever of Britain was a little wench, as touching the hit it.

	An' if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.

	I fear too much rubbing. Good night, my good owl.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 2><69%>
	O! I am stabb'd with laughter. Where's her Grace?
<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 2><69%>
	Prepare, madam, prepare!—
	Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are
	Against your peace: Love doth approach disguis'd,
	Armed in arguments; you'll be surpris'd:
	Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
	Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 2><69%>
	Under the cool shade of a sycamore
	I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour,
	When, lo! to interrupt my purpos'd rest,
	Toward that shade I might behold addrest
	The king and his companions: warily
	I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
	And overheard what you shall overhear;
	That, by and by, disguis'd they will be here.
	Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
	That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:
	Action and accent did they teach him there;
	'Thus must thou speak, and thus thy body bear.'
	And ever and anon they made a doubt
	Presence majestical would put him out;
	'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;
	Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'
	The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;
	I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
	With that all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,
	Making the bold wag by their praises bolder.
	One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd, and swore
	A better speech was never spoke before;
	Another, with his finger and his thumb,
	Cry'd 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'
	The third he caper'd and cried, 'All goes well;'
	The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.
	With that, they all did tumble on the ground,
	With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
	That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
	To check their folly, passion's solemn tears.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 5><SCENE 2><70%>
	They do, they do; and are apparell'd thus,
	Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
	Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;
	And every one his love-feat will advance
	Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
	By favours several which they did bestow.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 5><SCENE 2><71%>
	Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
	And quite divorce his memory from his part.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 2><71%>
	The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 5><SCENE 2><72%>
	Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 5><SCENE 2><72%>
	True; 'out,' indeed.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 5><SCENE 2><72%>
	They will not answer to that epithet;
	You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'
<SPEECH 52><ACT 5><SCENE 2><72%>
	What would you with the princess?
<SPEECH 53><ACT 5><SCENE 2><72%>
	Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 5><SCENE 2><73%>
	She says, you have it, and you may be gone.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 5><SCENE 2><73%>
	They say, that they have measur'd many a mile,
	To tread a measure with you on this grass.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 5><SCENE 2><73%>
	If to come hither you have measur'd miles,
	And many miles, the princess bids you tell
	How many inches do fill up one mile.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 5><SCENE 2><73%>
	She hears herself.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 5><SCENE 2><76%>
	The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
	As is the razor's edge invisible,
	Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
	Above the sense of sense; so sensible

	Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 5><SCENE 2><76%>
	Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.
<SPEECH 60><ACT 5><SCENE 2><77%>
	Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
	Immediately they will again be here
	In their own shapes; for it can never be
	They will digest this harsh indignity.
<SPEECH 61><ACT 5><SCENE 2><77%>
	They will, they will, God knows;
	And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:
	Therefore change favours; and, when they repair,
	Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 5><SCENE 2><77%>
	Fair ladies mask'd, are roses in their bud:
	Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
	Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 5><SCENE 2><78%>
	Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.
<SPEECH 64><ACT 5><SCENE 2><78%>
	Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty,

<SPEECH 65><ACT 5><SCENE 2><78%>
	I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.
<SPEECH 66><ACT 5><SCENE 2><84%>

	Most true; 'tis right: you were so, Alisander.
<SPEECH 71><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>

<SPEECH 72><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	A cittern-head.

	The pommel of Cæsar's falchion.
<SPEECH 74><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.
	And so adieu, sweet Jude! nay, why dost thou stay?
<SPEECH 75><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	A light for Monsieur Judas! it grows dark, he may stumble.
<SPEECH 76><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	But is this Hector?
<SPEECH 77><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	No; he is best indued in the small.
<SPEECH 78><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	</STAGE DIR> Loves her by the foot.
<SPEECH 79><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	Renowned Pompey!
<SPEECH 80><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of linen; since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none but a dish-clout of Jaquenetta's, and that a' wears next his heart for a favour.
