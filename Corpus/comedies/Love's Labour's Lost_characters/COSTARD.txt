	Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta. The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	In manner and form following, sir; all those three: I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with her upon the form, and taken following her into the park; which, put together, is, in manner and form following. Now, sir, for the manner,—it is the manner of a man to speak to a woman, for the form,—in some form.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	As it shall follow in my correction; and God defend the right!
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	Not a word of Costard yet.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	It may be so; but if he say it is so, he is, in telling true, but so.—
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	Be to me and every man that dares not fight.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	Me.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	Me.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	Still me.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	O me.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	With a wench.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	Sir, I confess the wench.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	I do confess much of the hearing it, but little of the marking of it.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damosel.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	This was no damosel neither, sir: she was a 'virgin.'
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	This maid will serve my turn, sir.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 1><11%>
	I suffer for the truth, sir: for true it is I was taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and till then, sit thee down, sorrow!
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 2><15%>
	Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a full stomach.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 2><15%>
	I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they are but lightly rewarded.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 2><16%>
	Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 2><16%>
	Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation that I have seen, some shall see—
<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 2><16%>
	Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon. It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their words; and therefore I will say nothing: I thank God I have as little patience as another man, and therefore I can be quiet.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 1><29%>
	No egma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the mail, sir. O! sir, plantain, a plain plantain: no l'envoy, no l'envoy: no salve, sir, but a plantain.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 1><30%>
	The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
	Sir, your pennyworth is good an your goose be fat.
	To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:
	Let me see; a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 1><30%>
	True, and I for a plantain: thus came your argument in;
	Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;
	And he ended the market.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 1><30%>
	Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak that l'envoy:
	I, Costard, running out, that was safely within,
	Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 1><30%>
	Till there be more matter in the shin.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 1><30%>
	O! marry me to one Frances: I smell some l'envoy, some goose, in this.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 1><31%>
	True, true, and now you will be my purgation and let me loose.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 3><SCENE 1><31%>
	My sweet ounce of man's flesh! my incony Jew!
	Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration! O! that's the Latin word for three farthings: three farthings, remuneration. 'What's the price of this inkle?' 'One penny.' 'No, I'll give you a remuneration:' why, it carries it Remuneration! why, it is a fairer name than French crown. I will never buy and sell out of this word.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 3><SCENE 1><31%>
	Pray you, sir, how much carnation riband may a man buy for a remuneration?
<SPEECH 37><ACT 3><SCENE 1><32%>
	Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 1><32%>
	I thank your worship. God be wi' you!
<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 1><32%>
	When would you have it done, sir?
<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 1><32%>
	Well, I will do it, sir! fare you well.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 1><32%>
	I shall know, sir, when I have done it.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 3><SCENE 1><32%>
	I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 1><32%>
	Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration; a 'leven-pence farthing better.
	Most sweet gardon! I will do it, sir, in print
	Gardon! remuneration!
<SPEECH 44><ACT 4><SCENE 1><35%>
	God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?
<SPEECH 45><ACT 4><SCENE 1><35%>
	Which is the greatest lady, the highest?
<SPEECH 46><ACT 4><SCENE 1><35%>
	The thickest, and the tallest! it is so; truth is truth.
	An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,
	One o'these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit.
	Are not you the chief woman? you are the thickest here.

	I have a letter from Monsieur Berowne to one Lady Rosaline.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 4><SCENE 1><37%>
	I told you; my lord.

	From my lord Berowne, a good master of mine,

<SPEECH 51><ACT 4><SCENE 1><39%>
	By my troth, most pleasant: how both did fit it!

	Indeed a' must shoot nearer, or he'll ne'er hit the clout.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 4><SCENE 1><39%>
	Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 4><SCENE 1><39%>
	She's too hard for you at pricks, sir: challenge her to bowl.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 4><SCENE 1><39%>
	By my soul, a swain! a most simple clown!
	Lord, lord how the ladies and I have put him down!
	O' my troth, most sweet jests! most incony vulgar wit!
	When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it were, so fit,
	Armado, o' the one side, O! a most dainty man.
	To see him walk before a lady, and to bear her fan!
	To see him kiss his hand! and how most sweetly a' will swear!
	And his page o' t'other side, that handful of wit!
	Ah! heavens, it is a most pathetical nit.

	O! they have lived long on the almsbasket of words. I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word; for thou art not so long by the head as honorificabilitudinitatibus: thou art easier swallowed than a flap-dragon.

	An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst have it to buy gingerbread. Hold, there is the very remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O! an the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me. Go to; thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers' ends, as they say.

	O Lord, sir, they would know

	No, sir; but it is vara fine,

<SPEECH 66><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
	Not so, sir; under correction, sir, I hope, it is not so.
	You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir; we know what we know:
	I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,—
<SPEECH 67><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
	Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.
<SPEECH 68><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
	O Lord, sir! it were pity you should get your living by reckoning, sir.
<SPEECH 69><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
	O Lord, sir! the parties themselves, the actors, sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mine own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man in one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir.
<SPEECH 70><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
	It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the Great: for mine own part, I know not the degree of the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.
<SPEECH 71><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
	We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take some care.

	It is 'Great,' sir; Pompey surnam'd the Great;
	That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make my foe to sweat:

	And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France.
	If your ladyship would say, 'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done.
<SPEECH 76><ACT 5><SCENE 2><87%>
	'Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect. I made a little fault in 'Great.'

But there are Worthies a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort.
