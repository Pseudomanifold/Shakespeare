	The young Dumaine, a well-accomplish'd youth,
	Of all that virtue love for virtue lov'd:
	Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill,
	For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
	And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
	I saw him at the Duke Alen√ßon's once;
	And much too little of that good I saw
	Is my report to his great worthiness.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 5><SCENE 2><66%>
	Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 5><SCENE 2><66%>
	He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
	And so she died: had she been light, like you,
	Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,
	She might ha' been a grandam ere she died;
	And so may you, for a light heart lives long.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 5><SCENE 2><66%>
	A light condition in a beauty dark.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 5><SCENE 2><66%>
	You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
	Therefore, I'll darkly end the argument.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 5><SCENE 2><67%>
	So do not you, for you are a light wench.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 5><SCENE 2><67%>
	You weigh me not. O! that's you care not for me.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 5><SCENE 2><67%>
	Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 2><67%>
	A pox of that jest! and beshrew all shrows!
<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 2><67%>
	Madam, this glove.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 2><67%>
	Yes, madam; and moreover,
	Some thousand verses of a faithful lover:
	A huge translation of hypocrisy,
	Vilely compil'd, profound simplicity.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 2><71%>
	But in this changing what is your intent?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 2><75%>
	What! was your visor made without a tongue?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 2><75%>
	O! for your reason; quickly, sir; I long.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 2><75%>
	'Veal,' quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 2><75%>
	No, a fair lord calf.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 2><75%>
	No, I'll not be your half:
	Take all, and wean it: it may prove an ox.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 2><76%>
	Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 2><76%>
	Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 2><77%>
	Lord Longaville said, I came o'er his heart;
	And trow you what he call'd me?
<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 2><77%>
	Yes, in good faith.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 2><77%>
	And Longaville was for my service born.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
	A wife! A beard, fair health, and honesty;
	With three-fold love I wish you all these three.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
	Not so, my lord. A twelvemonth and a day
	I'll mark no words that smooth-fac'd wooers say:
	Come when the king doth to my lady come;
	Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
	Yet swear not, lest you be forsworn again.
