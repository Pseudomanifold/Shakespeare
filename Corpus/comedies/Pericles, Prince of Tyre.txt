<ACT 1>
<STAGE DIR>
<Before the Palace of Antioch.>
</STAGE DIR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Gower.>
</STAGE DIR>

	To sing a song that old was sung,
	From ashes ancient Gower is come,
	Assuming man's infirmities,
	To glad your ear, and please your eyes.
	It hath been sung at festivals,
	On ember-eves, and holy-ales;
	And lords and ladies in their lives
	Have read it for restoratives:
	The purchase is to make men glorious;
	Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius.
	If you, born in these latter times,
	When wit's more ripe, accept my rimes,
	And that to hear an old man sing
	May to your wishes pleasure bring,
	I life would wish, and that I might
	Waste it for you like taper-light.
	This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great
	Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat,
	The fairest in all Syria,
	I tell you what mine authors say:
	This king unto him took a fere,
	Who died and left a female heir,
	So buxom, blithe, and full of face
	As heaven had lent her all his grace;
	With whom the father liking took,
	And her to incest did provoke.
	Bad child, worse father! to entice his own
	To evil should be done by none.
	By custom what they did begin
	Was with long use account no sin.
	The beauty of this sinful dame
	Made many princes thither frame,
	To seek her as a bed-fellow,
	In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:
	Which to prevent, he made a law,
	To keep her still, and men in awe,
	That whoso ask'd her for his wife,
	His riddle told not, lost his life:
	So for her many a wight did die,
	As yon grim looks do testify.
	What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye
	I give, my cause who best can justify.

<Antioch. A Room in the Palace.>

<Enter Antiochus, Pericles, and Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ANTIOCHUS>	<2%>
	Young Prince of Tyre, you have at large receiv'd
	The danger of the task you undertake.
</ANTIOCHUS>

<PERICLES>	<2%>
	I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul
	Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
	Think death no hazard in this enterprise.
</PERICLES>

<ANTIOCHUS>	<2%>
	Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,
	For the embracements even of Jove himself;
	At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,
	Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,
	The senate-house of planets all did sit,
	To knit in her their best perfections.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter the Daughter of Antiochus.>
</STAGE DIR>
<PERICLES>	<2%>
	See, where she comes apparell'd like the spring,
	Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king
	Of every virtue gives renown to men!
	Her face the book of praises, where is read
	Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence
	Sorrow were ever raz'd, and testy wrath
	Could never be her mild companion.
	You gods, that made me man, and sway in love,
	That hath inflam'd desire in my breast
	To taste the fruit of you celestial tree
	Or die in the adventure, be my helps,
	As I am son and servant to your will,
	To compass such a boundless happiness!
</PERICLES>

<ANTIOCHUS>	<3%>
	Prince Pericles,—
</ANTIOCHUS>

<PERICLES>	<3%>
	That would be son to great Antiochus.
</PERICLES>

<ANTIOCHUS>	<3%>
	Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,
	With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd;
	For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:
	Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view
	Her countless glory, which desert must gain;
	And which, without desert, because thine eye
	Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.
	Yon sometime famous princes, like thyself,
	Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,
	Tell thee with speechless tongues and semblance pale,
	That without covering, save yon field of stars,
	They here stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;
	And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
	For going on death's net, whom none resist.
</ANTIOCHUS>

<PERICLES>	<4%>
	Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught
	My frail mortality to know itself,
	And by those fearful objects to prepare
	This body, like to them, to what I must;
	For death remember'd should be like a mirror,
	Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.
	I'll make my will then; and as sick men do,
	Who know the world, see heaven, but feeling woe,
	Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did:
	So I bequeath a happy peace to you
	And all good men, as every prince should do;
	My riches to the earth from whence they came,
<STAGE DIR>
<To the Daughter of Antiochus.>
</STAGE DIR>
	But my unspotted fire of love to you.
	Thus ready for the way of life or death,
	I wait the sharpest blow.
</PERICLES>

<ANTIOCHUS>	<4%>
	Scorning advice, read the conclusion then;
	Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,
	As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.
</ANTIOCHUS>

<DAUGHTER>	<4%>
	Of all say'd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!
	Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!
</DAUGHTER>

<PERICLES>	<4%>
	Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,
	Nor ask advice of any other thought
	But faithfulness and courage.

	I am no viper, yet I feed
	On mother's flesh which did me breed;
	I sought a husband, in which labour
	I found that kindness in a father.
	He's father, son, and husband mild,
	I mother, wife, and yet his child.
	How they may be, and yet in two,
	As you will live, resolve it you.

	Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers!
	That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,
	Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,
	If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?
	Fair glass of light, I lov'd you, and could still,
	Were not this glorious casket stor'd with ill:
	But I must tell you now my thoughts revolt;
	For he's no man on whom perfections wait
	That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.
	You're a fair viol, and your sense the strings,
	Who, finger'd to make men his lawful music,
	Would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken;
	But being play'd upon before your time,
	Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
	Good sooth, I care not for you.
</PERICLES>

<ANTIOCHUS>	<5%>
	Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life,
	For that's an article within our law,
	As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expir'd:
	Either expound now or receive your sentence.
</ANTIOCHUS>

<PERICLES>	<6%>
	Great king,
	Few love to hear the sins they love to act;
	'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.
	Who has a book of all that monarchs do,
	He's more secure to keep it shut than shown;
	For vice repeated is like the wandering wind,
	Blows dust in others' eyes, to spread itself;
	And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,
	The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear
	To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts
	Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd
	By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for 't.
	Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's their will;
	And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?
	It is enough you know; and it is fit,
	What being more known grows worse, to smother it.
	All love the womb that their first being bred,
	Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.
</PERICLES>

<ANTIOCHUS>	<6%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Heaven! that I had thy head; he has found the meaning;
	But I will gloze with him. Young Prince of Tyre,
	Though by the tenour of our strict edict,
	Your exposition misinterpreting,
	We might proceed to cancel of your days;
	Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree
	As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:
	Forty days longer we do respite you;
	If by which time our secret be undone,
	This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son:
	And until then your entertain shall be
	As doth befit our honour and your worth.
</ANTIOCHUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt all but Pericles.>
</STAGE DIR>

<PERICLES>	<7%>
	How courtesy would seem to cover sin,
	When what is done is like a hypocrite,
	The which is good in nothing but in sight!
	If it be true that I interpret false,
	Then were it certain you were not so bad
	As with foul incest to abuse your soul;
	Where now you're both a father and a son,
	By your untimely claspings with your child,—
	Which pleasure fits a husband, not a father;—
	And she an eater of her mother's flesh,
	By the defiling of her parent's bed;
	And both like serpents are, who though they feed
	On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.
	Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men
	Blush not in actions blacker than the night,
	Will shun no course to keep them from the light.
	One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
	Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke.
	Poison and treason are the hands of sin,
	Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:
	Then, lest my life be cropp'd to keep you clear,
	By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.

	He hath found the meaning, for which we mean
	To take his head.
	He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,
	Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
	In such a loathed manner;
	And therefore instantly this prince must die,
	For by his fall my honour must keep high.

	Thaliard, behold, here's poison, and here's gold;
	We hate the Prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:
	It fits thee not to ask the reason why,
	Because we bid it. Say, is it done?

<To those without.>
</STAGE DIR> Let none disturb us.—
	Why should this change of thoughts,
	The sad companion, dull-ey'd melancholy,
	Be my so us'd a guest, as not an hour
	In the day's glorious walk or peaceful night—
	The tomb where grief should sleep—can breed me quiet?
	Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,
	And danger, which I feared, is at Antioch,
	Whose arm seems far too short to hit me here;
	Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,
	Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.
	Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,
	That have their first conception by mis-dread,
	Have after-nourishment and life by care;
	And what was first but fear what might be done,
	Grows elder now and cares it be not done.
	And so with me: the great Antiochus,—
	'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,
	Since he's so great can make his will his act,—
	Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;
	Nor boots it me to say I honour him,
	If he suspect I may dishonour him;
	And what may make him blush in being known,
	He'll stop the course by which it might be known.
	With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,
	And with the ostent of war will look so huge,
	Amazement shall drive courage from the state,
	Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,
	And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:
	Which care of them, not pity of myself,—
	Who am no more but as the tops of trees,
	Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,—
	Make both my body pine and soul to languish,
	And punish that before that he would punish.

	Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,
	Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err:
	When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,
	He flatters you, makes war upon your life.

	Rise, prithee, rise;
	Sit down; thou art no flatterer:
	I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid

	Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,
	Who by thy wisdom mak'st a prince thy servant,
	What wouldst thou have me do?
</PERICLES>

<HELICANUS>	<12%>
	To bear with patience
	Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.
</HELICANUS>

<PERICLES>	<12%>
	Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,
	That minister'st a potion unto me
	That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
	Attend me then: I went to Antioch,
	Where as thou know'st, against the face of death
	I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty,
	From whence an issue I might propagate
	Are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects.
	Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;
	The rest, hark in thine ear, as black as incest;
	Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father
	Seem'd not to strike, but smooth; but thou know'st this,
	'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.
	Which fear so grew in me I hither fled,
	Under the covering of a careful night,
	Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,
	Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.
	I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears
	Decrease not, but grow faster than the years.
	And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,
	That I should open to the listening air
	How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,
	To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,
	To lop that doubt he'll fill this land with arms,
	And make pretence of wrong that I have done him;
	When all, for mine, if I may call 't, offence,
	Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:
	Which love to all, of which thyself art one,
	Who now reprov'st me for it,—
</PERICLES>

<HELICANUS>	<13%>
	Alas! sir.
</HELICANUS>

<PERICLES>	<13%>
	Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,
	Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts
	How I might stop this tempest, ere it came;
	And finding little comfort to relieve them,
	I thought it princely charity to grieve them.
</PERICLES>

<HELICANUS>	<13%>
	Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak,
	Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,
	And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,
	Who either by public war or private treason
	Will take away your life.
	Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,
	Till that his rage and anger be forgot,
	Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.
	Your rule direct to any; if to me,
	Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be.

<PERICLES>	<14%>
	Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tarsus
	Intend my travel, where I'll hear from thee,
	And by whose letters I'll dispose myself.
	The care I had and have of subjects' good
	On thee I'll lay, whose wisdom's strength can bear it.
	I'll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath;
	Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both.
	But in our orbs we'll live so round and safe,
	That time of both this truth shall ne'er convince,
	Thou show'dst a subject's shine, I a true prince.

<THALIARD>	<14%>
	So this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must I kill King Pericles; and if I do not, I am sure to be hanged at home: 'tis dangerous. Well, I perceive he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that, being bid to ask what he would of the king, desired he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he had some reason for it; for if a king bid a man be a villain, he is bound by the indenture of his oath to be one. Hush! here come the lords of Tyre.

<THALIARD>	<15%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> What from Antioch?
</THALIARD>

<HELICANUS>	<15%>
	Royal Antiochus—on what cause I know not—
	Took some displeasure at him, at least he judg'd so;
	And doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,
	To show his sorrow he'd correct himself;
	So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,
	With whom each minute threatens life or death.
</HELICANUS>

<THALIARD>	<16%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Well, I perceive
	I shall not be hang'd now, although I would;
	But since he's gone, the king it sure must please:
	He 'scap'd the land, to perish at the sea.
	I'll present myself. <STAGE DIR>
<Aloud.>
</STAGE DIR> Peace to the lords of Tyre.
</THALIARD>

<HELICANUS>	<16%>
	Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.
</HELICANUS>

<THALIARD>	<16%>
	From him I come,
	With message unto princely Pericles;
	But since my landing I have understood
	Your lord hath betook himself to unknown travels,
	My message must return from whence it came.
</THALIARD>

<HELICANUS>	<16%>
	We have no reason to desire it,
	Commended to our master, not to us:
	Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,
	As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.

	My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,
	And by relating tales of others' griefs,
	See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?
</CLEON>

<DIONYZA>	<16%>
	That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;
	For who digs hills because they do aspire
	Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.
	O my distressed lord! even such our griefs are;
	Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,
	But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.
</DIONYZA>

<CLEON>	<17%>
	O Dionyza,
	Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,
	Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?
	Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
	Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep
	Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;
	That if heaven slumber while their creatures want,
	They may awake their helps to comfort them.
	I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,
	And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.

<DIONYZA>	<17%>
	I'll do my best, sir.

	This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,
	A city on whom plenty held full hand,
	For riches strew'd herself even in the streets;
	Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,
	And strangers ne'er beheld but wonder'd at;
	Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,
	Like one another's glass to trim them by:
	Their tables were stor'd full to glad the sight,
	And not so much to feed on as delight;
	All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,
	The name of help grew odious to repeat.

	Were all too little to content and please,
	Although they gave their creatures in abundance,
	As houses are defil'd for want of use,
	They are now starv'd for want of exercise;
	Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,
	Must have inventions to delight the taste,
	Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it;
	Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,
	Thought nought too curious, are ready now
	To eat those little darlings whom they lov'd.
	So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife
	Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life.
	Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;
	Here many sink, yet those which see them fall
	Have scarce strength left to give them burial.
	Is not this true?

	One sorrow never comes but brings an heir

	Taking advantage of our misery,
	Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,
	To beat us down, the which are down already;
	And make a conquest of unhappy me,
	Whereas no glory's got to overcome.

	He, doing so, put forth to seas,

	'Keep it, my Pericles, it hath been a shield
	'Twixt me and death;'—and pointed to this brace;
	'For that it sav'd me, keep it; in like necessity—
	The which the gods protect thee from!—'t may defend thee.'
	It kept where I kept, I so dearly lov'd it;
	Till the rough seas, that spare not any man,
	Took it in rage, though calm'd they have given 't again.

</STAGE DIR>

	By many a dern and painful perch,
	Of Pericles the careful search
	By the four opposing coigns,
	Which the world together joins,
	Is made with all due diligence
	That horse and sail and high expense,
	Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,—
	Fame answering the most strange inquire—
	To the court of King Simonides
	Are letters brought, the tenour these:
	Antiochus and his daughter dead;
	The men of Tyrus on the head
	Of Helicanus would set on
	The crown of Tyre, but he will none:
	The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress;
	Says to 'em, if King Pericles
	Come not home in twice six moons,
	He, obedient to their dooms,
	Will take the crown. The sum of this,
	Brought hither to Pentapolis,
	Yravished the regions round,
	And every one with claps can sound,
	'Our heir-apparent is a king!
	Who dream'd, who thought of such a thing?'
	Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:
	His queen, with child, makes her desire,—
	Which who shall cross?—along to go;
	Omit we all their dole and woe:
	Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,
	And so to sea. Their vessel shakes
	On Neptune's billow; half the flood
	Hath their keel cut: but Fortune's mood
	Varies again; the grisled north
	Disgorges such a tempest forth,
	That, as a duck for life that dives,
	So up and down the poor ship drives.
	The lady shrieks, and well-a-near
	Does fall in travail with her fear;
	And what ensues in this fell storm
	Shall for itself itself perform.
	I nill relate, action may
	Conveniently the rest convey,
	Which might not what by me is told.

	Good morrow to your lordship.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<CERIMON>	<50%>
	Gentlemen,
	Why do you stir so early?
</CERIMON>

<GENTLEMAN 1>	<50%>
	Sir,
	Our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea,
	Shook as the earth' did quake;
	The very principals did seem to rend,
	And all to topple. Pure surprise and fear
	Made me to quit the house.
</GENTLEMAN 1>

<GENTLEMAN 2>	<51%>
	That is the cause we trouble you so early;
	'Tis not our husbandry.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<CERIMON>	<51%>
	O! you say well.
</CERIMON>

<GENTLEMAN 1>	<51%>
	But I much marvel that your lordship, having
	Rich tire about you, should at these early hours
	Shake off the golden slumber of repose.
	'Tis most strange,
	Nature should be so conversant with pain,
	Being thereto not compell'd.
</GENTLEMAN 1>

<CERIMON>	<51%>
	I hold it ever,
	Virtue and cunning were endowments greater
	Than nobleness and riches; careless heirs
	May the two latter darken and expend,
	But immortality attends the former,
	Making a man a god. 'Tis known I ever
	Have studied physic, through which secret art,
	By turning o'er authorities, I have—
	Together with my practice—made familiar
	To me and to my aid the blest infusions
	That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;
	And can speak of the disturbances
	That nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me
	A more content in course of true delight
	Than to be thirsty after tottering honour,
	Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,
	To please the fool and death.
</CERIMON>

<GENTLEMAN 2>	<52%>
	Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth
	Your charity, and hundreds call themselves
	Your creatures, who by you have been restor'd:

	Your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon
	Such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay.

</SERVANT 1>

<CERIMON>	<52%>
	Set it down; let's look upon 't.
</CERIMON>

<GENTLEMAN 2>	<52%>
	'Tis like a coffin, sir.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<CERIMON>	<52%>
	Whate'er it be,
	'Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight;
	If the sea's stomach be o'ercharg'd with gold,
	'Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us.
</CERIMON>

<GENTLEMAN 2>	<52%>
	'Tis so, my lord.

	I, King Pericles, have lost
	This queen worth all our mundane cost.
	Who finds her, give her burying;
	She was the daughter of a king:
	Besides this treasure for a fee,
	The gods requite his charity!

	If thou liv'st, Pericles, thou hast a heart

	We cannot but obey

<CLEON>	<55%>
	Fear not, my lord, but think
	Your Grace, that fed my country with your corn—
	For which the people's prayers still fall upon you—
	Must in your child be thought on. If neglection
	Should therein make me vile, the common body,
	By you reliev'd, would force me to my duty;
	But if to that my nature need a spur,
	The gods revenge it upon me and mine,

</STAGE DIR>

	Imagine Pericles arriv'd at Tyre,
	Welcom'd and settled to his own desire.
	His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,
	Unto Diana there a votaress.
	Now to Marina bend your mind,
	Whom our fast-growing scene must find
	At Tarsus, and by Cleon train'd
	In music, letters; who hath gain'd
	Of education all the grace,
	Which makes her bath the heart and places
	Of general wonder. But, alack!
	That monster envy, oft the wrack
	Of earned praise, Marina's life
	Seeks to take off by treason's knife.
	And in this kind hath our Cleon
	One daughter, and a wench full grown,
	Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid
	Hight Philoten, and it is said
	For certain in our story, she
	Would ever with Marina be:
	Be 't when she weav'd the sleided silk
	With fingers, long, small, white as milk,
	Or when she would with sharp neeld wound
	The cambric, which she made more sound
	By hurting it; when to the lute
	She sung, and made the night-bird mute,
	That still records with moan; or when
	She would with rich and constant pen
	Vail to her mistress Dian; still
	This Philoten contends in skill
	With absolute Marina: so
	With the dove of Paphos might the crow
	Vie feathers white. Marina gets
	All praises, which are paid as debts,
	And not as given. This so darks
	In Philoten all graceful marks,
	That Cleon's wife, with envy rare,
	A present murderer does prepare
	For good Marina, that her daughter
	Might stand peerless by this slaughter.
	The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,
	Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:
	And cursed Dionyza hath
	The pregnant instrument of wrath
	Prest for this blow. The unborn event
	I do commend to your content:
	Only I carry winged time
	Post on the lame feet of my rime;
	Which never could I so convey,
	Unless your thoughts went on my way.

	O! our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor the commodity wages not with the danger; therefore, if in our youths we could pick up some pretty estate, 'twere not amiss to keep our door hatched. Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods will be strong with us for giving over.

	O! sir, we doubt it not.

<BOULT>	<65%>
	Master, I have gone through for this piece, you see: if you like her, so; if not, I have lost my earnest.
</BOULT>

<BAWD>	<65%>
	Boult, has she any qualities?
</BAWD>

<BOULT>	<65%>
	She has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent good clothes; there's no further necessity of qualities can make her be refused.
</BOULT>

<BAWD>	<65%>
	What's her price, Boult?
</BAWD>

<BOULT>	<65%>
	I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.
</BOULT>

<PANDAR>	<65%>
	Well, follow me, my masters, you shall have your money presently. Wife, take her in; instruct her what she has to do, that she may not be raw in her entertainment.

<BAWD>	<66%>
	Boult, take you the marks of her, the colour of her hair, complexion, height, age, with warrant of her virginity; and cry, 'He that will give most, shall have her first.' Such a maiden-head were no cheap thing, if men were as they have been. Get this done as I command you.

	Alack! that Leonine was so slack, so slow.
	He should have struck, not spoke; or that these pirates—

<BAWD>	<66%>
	You are lit into my hands, where you are like to live.
</BAWD>

<MARINA>	<66%>
	The more my fault

</MARINA>

<BAWD>	<66%>
	Ay, and you shall live in pleasure.
</BAWD>

<MARINA>	<66%>
	No.
</MARINA>

	An honest woman, or not a woman.

<Re-enter Boult.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?
<BOULT>	<67%>
	I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs; I have drawn her picture with my voice.
</BOULT>

<BAWD>	<67%>
	And I prithee, tell me, how dost thou find the inclination of the people, especially of the younger sort?
</BAWD>

<BOULT>	<67%>
	Faith, they listened to me, as they would have hearkened to their father's testament. There was a Spaniard's mouth so watered, that he went to bed to her very description.
</BOULT>

<BAWD>	<67%>
	We shall have him here to-morrow with his best ruff on.

</BOULT>

<BAWD>	<68%>
	Who? Monsieur Veroles?
</BAWD>

<BOULT>	<68%>
	Ay; he offered to cut a caper at the proclamation; but he made a groan at it, and swore he would see her to-morrow.
</BOULT>

<BAWD>	<68%>
	Well, well; as for him, he brought his disease hither: here he does but repair it. I know he will come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the sun.
</BAWD>

<To Marina.>
</STAGE DIR> Pray you, come hither awhile. You have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you must seem to do that fearfully, which you commit willingly; to despise profit where you have most gain. To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your lovers; seldom but that pity begets you a good opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.

<MARINA>	<68%>
	I understand you not.
</MARINA>

<BOULT>	<68%>
	O! take her home, mistress, take her home; these blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practice.

	Thou sayst true, i' faith, so they must; for your bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go with warrant.

	Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.
</BAWD>

<BOULT>	<69%>
	I may so?

	Who should deny it? Come, young one, I like the manner of your garments well.
</BAWD>

<BOULT>	<69%>
	Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.
</BOULT>

<BAWD>	<69%>
	Boult, spend thou that in the town; report what a sojourner we have; you'll lose nothing by custom. When nature framed this piece, she meant thee a good turn; therefore say what a paragon she is, and thou hast the harvest out of thine own report.
</BAWD>

<BOULT>	<69%>
	I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up the lewdly-inclined. I'll bring home some to-night.

	O Dionyza! such a piece of slaughter

	I think
	You'll turn a child again.
</DIONYZA>

<CLEON>	<70%>
	Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,
	I'd give it to undo the deed. O lady!
	Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess
	To equal any single crown o' the earth
	I' the justice of compare. O villain Leonine!
	Whom thou hast poison'd too;
	If thou hadst drunk to him 't had been a kindness
	Becoming well thy fact; what canst thou say
	When noble Pericles shall demand his child?
</CLEON>

<DIONYZA>	<70%>
	That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,
	To foster it, nor ever to preserve.
	She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?
	Unless you play the pious innocent,
	And for an honest attribute cry out
	'She died by foul play.'
</DIONYZA>

<CLEON>	<70%>
	O! go to. Well, well,
	Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods
	Do like this worst.
</CLEON>

<DIONYZA>	<70%>
	Be one of those that think
	The pretty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,
	And open this to Pericles. I do shame
	To think of what a noble strain you are,
	And of how coward a spirit.
</DIONYZA>

<CLEON>	<70%>
	To such proceeding
	Who ever but his approbation added,
	Though not his prime consent, he did not flow
	From honourable sources.
</CLEON>

<DIONYZA>	<71%>
	Be it so, then;
	Yet none does know but you how she came dead,
	Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.
	She did distain my child, and stood between
	Her and her fortunes; none would look on her,
	But cast their gazes on Marina's face,
	Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
	Not worth the time of day. It pierc'd me thorough;
	And though you call my course unnatural,
	You not your child well loving, yet I find
	It greets me as an enterprise of kindness
	Perform'd to your sole daughter.
</DIONYZA>

<CLEON>	<71%>
	Heavens forgive it!
</CLEON>

<DIONYZA>	<71%>
	And as for Pericles,
	What should he say? We wept after her hearse,
	And even yet we mourn; her monument
	Is almost finish'd, and her epitaphs
	In glittering golden characters express
	A general praise to her, and care in us
	At whose expense 'tis done.
</DIONYZA>

<CLEON>	<71%>
	Thou art like the harpy,
	Which, to betray, dost with thine angel's face,
	Seize with thine eagle's talons.
</CLEON>

	You are like one that superstitiously

	Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short;
	Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for 't;
	Making—to take your imagination—
	From bourn to bourn, region to region.
	By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime
	To use one language in each several clime
	Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you
	To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,
	The stages of our story. Pericles
	Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,
	Attended on by many a lord and knight,
	To see his daughter, all his life's delight.
	Old Helicanus goes along. Behind
	Is left to govern it, you bear in mind,
	Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late
	Advanc'd in time to great and high estate.
	Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought
	This king to Tarsus, think his pilot thought,
	So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,
	To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.
	Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;
	Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.

<Dumb Show.>

<Enter at one door Pericles, with his Train; Cleon...>
<... and Dionyza at the other. Cleon shows Pericles...>
<... the tomb of Marina; whereat Pericles makes lamentation,...>
<... puts on sackcloth, and in a mighty passion departs. Exeunt Cleon and Dionyza.>
</STAGE DIR>
	See how belief may suffer by foul show!
	This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;
	And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,
	With sighs shot through, and biggest tears o'ershower'd,
	Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears
	Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs;
	He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears
	A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,
	And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit
	The epitaph is for Marina writ
	By wicked Dionyza.
<STAGE DIR>
<Reads inscription on Marina's monument.>
</STAGE DIR>

	the fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,
	who wither'd in her spring of year:
	she was of tyrus the king's daughter,
	on whom foul death hath made this slaughter.
	marina was she call'd; and at her birth,
	thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:
	therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,
	hath thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:
	wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,
	make raging battery upon shores of flint.

	No visor does become black villany
	So well as soft and tender flattery.
	Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,
	And bear his courses to be ordered
	By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play
	His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day
	In her unholy service. Patience then,
	And think you now are all in Mitylen.

	Fie, fie upon her! she is able to freeze the god Priapus, and undo a whole generation; we must either get her ravished, or be rid of her.

	Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chances

	She sings like one immortal, and she dances

	Nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,
	That even her art sisters the natural roses;
	Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry;
	That pupils lacks she none of noble race,
	Who pour their bounty on her; and her gain
	She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place;
	And to her father turn our thoughts again,
	Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost,
	Whence, driven before the winds, he is arriv'd
	Here where his daughter dwells: and on this coast

	God Neptune's annual feast to keep; from whence
	Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,
	His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;

	O! sir, a courtesy,

	But have been gaz'd on like a comet; she speaks,
	My lord, that, may be, hath endur'd a grief
	Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh'd.
	Though wayward Fortune did malign my state,
	My derivation was from ancestors
	Who stood equivalent with mighty kings;
	But time hath rooted out my parentage,
	And to the world and awkward casualties
	Bound me in servitude.—<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> I will desist;

	My fortunes—parentage—good parentage—
	To equal mine!—was it not thus? what say you?

	You would not do me violence.
</MARINA>

	I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me.
	You are like something that—What country-woman?
	Here of these shores?

	No, nor of any shores;
	Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am
	No other than I appear.
</MARINA>

<PERICLES>	<88%>
	I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.
	My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one
	My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;
	Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;
	As silver-voic'd; her eyes as jewel-like,
	And cas'd as richly; in pace another Juno;
	Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,
	The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?
</PERICLES>

<MARINA>	<89%>
	Where I am but a stranger; from the deck
	You may discern the place.

	Prithee, speak;
	Falseness cannot come from thee, for thou look'st
	Modest as justice, and thou seem'st a palace
	For the crown'd truth to dwell in. I believe thee,
	And make my senses credit thy relation
	To points that seem impossible; for thou lookest
	Like one I lov'd indeed. What were thy friends?
	Didst thou not say when I did push thee back,—
	Which was when I perceiv'd thee,—that thou cam'st
	From good descending?
</PERICLES>

<MARINA>	<89%>
	So indeed I did.
</MARINA>

<PERICLES>	<89%>
	Report thy parentage. I think thou saidst
	Thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury,
	And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,
	If both were open'd.
</PERICLES>

<MARINA>	<89%>
	Some such thing
	I said, and said no more but what my thoughts
	Did warrant me was likely.
</MARINA>

<PERICLES>	<89%>
	Tell thy story;
	If thine consider'd prove the thousandth part
	Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I

	Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?

	O! stop there a little.
	This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep

	Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child,

	Now our sands are almost run;
	More a little, and then dumb.
	This, my last boon, give me,
	For such kindness must relieve me,
	That you aptly will suppose
	What pageantry, what feats, what shows,
	What minstrelsy, and pretty din,
	The regent made in Mitylen
	To greet the king. So he thriv'd,
	That he is promis'd to be wiv'd
	To fair Marina; but in no wise
	Till he had done his sacrifice,
	As Dian bade: whereto being bound,
	The interim, pray you, all confound.
	In feather'd briefness sails are fill'd,
	And wishes fall out as they're will'd.
	At Ephesus, the temple see,
	Our king and all his company.
	That he can hither come so soon,
	Is by your fancy's thankful doom.

<The Temple of Diana at Ephesus; Thaisa standing near...>

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Pericles, with his Train; Lysimachus, Helicanus, Marina, and a Lady.>
</STAGE DIR>
<PERICLES>	<96%>
	Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,
	I here confess myself the King of Tyre;
	Who, frighted from my country, did wed
	At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.
	At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth
	A maid-child call'd Marina; who, O goddess!
	Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus
	Was nurs'd with Cleon, whom at fourteen years
	He sought to murder; but her better stars
	Brought her to Mitylene, 'gainst whose shore
	Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,
	Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she
	Made known herself my daughter.
</PERICLES>

<THAISA>	<96%>
	Voice and favour!
	You are, you are—O royal Pericles!—
</THAISA>
<STAGE DIR>
<She faints.>
</STAGE DIR>

<PERICLES>	<96%>
	What means the nun? she dies! help, gentlemen!
</PERICLES>

<CERIMON>	<96%>
	Noble sir,
	If you have told Diana's altar true,
	This is your wife.
</CERIMON>

<PERICLES>	<96%>
	Reverend appearer, no;
	I threw her o'erboard with these very arms.
</PERICLES>

<CERIMON>	<97%>
	Upon this coast, I warrant you.
</CERIMON>

<PERICLES>	<97%>
	'Tis most certain.
</PERICLES>

<CERIMON>	<97%>
	Look to the lady. O! she's but o'erjoy'd.
	Early in blustering morn this lady was
	Thrown upon this shore. I op'd the coffin,
	Found there rich jewels; recover'd her, and plac'd her
	Here in Diana's temple.
</CERIMON>

<PERICLES>	<97%>
	May we see them?
</PERICLES>

<CERIMON>	<97%>
	Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,
	Whither I invite you. Look! Thaisa is
	Recovered.
</CERIMON>

<THAISA>	<97%>
	O! let me look!
	If he be none of mine, my sanctity
	Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,
	But curb it, spite of seeing. O! my lord,
	Are you not Pericles? Like him you speak,
	Like him you are. Did you not name a tempest,
	A birth, and death?
</THAISA>

<PERICLES>	<97%>
	The voice of dead Thaisa!
</PERICLES>

<THAISA>	<97%>
	That Thaisa am I, supposed dead
	And drown'd.
</THAISA>

<PERICLES>	<97%>
	Immortal Dian!
</PERICLES>

<THAISA>	<97%>
	Now I know you better.
	When we with tears parted Pentapolis,
	The king my father gave you such a ring.
</THAISA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Shows a ring.>
</STAGE DIR>

<PERICLES>	<97%>
	This, this: no more, you gods! your present kindness
	Makes my past miseries sport: you shall do well,
	That on the touching of her lips I may
	Melt and no more be seen. O! come, be buried
	A second time within these arms.

	Look, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa;
	Thy burden at the sea, and call'd Marina,
	For she was yielded there.
</PERICLES>

<THAISA>	<98%>
	Bless'd, and mine own!
</THAISA>

<HELICANUS>	<98%>
	Hail, madam, and my queen!
</HELICANUS>

<THAISA>	<98%>
	I know you not.
</THAISA>

<PERICLES>	<98%>
	You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre,
	I left behind an ancient substitute;
	Can you remember what I call'd the man?
	I have nam'd him oft.
</PERICLES>

<THAISA>	<98%>
	'Twas Helicanus then.
</THAISA>

<PERICLES>	<98%>
	Still confirmation!
	Embrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he.
	Now do I long to hear how you were found,
	How possibly preserv'd, and whom to thank,
	Besides the gods, for this great miracle.
</PERICLES>

<THAISA>	<98%>
	Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man,
	Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can
	From first to last resolve you.
</THAISA>

<PERICLES>	<98%>
	Reverend sir,
	The gods can have no mortal officer
	More like a god than you. Will you deliver
	How this dead queen re-lives?
</PERICLES>

<CERIMON>	<98%>
	I will, my lord.
	Beseech you, first go with me to my house.
	Where shall be shown you all was found with her;
	How she came placed here in the temple;
	No needful thing omitted.
</CERIMON>

<PERICLES>	<99%>
	Pure Dian! bless thee for thy vision; I
	Will offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa,
	This prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter,
	Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now
	This ornament
	Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;
	And what this fourteen years no rasor touch'd,
	To grace thy marriage-day I'll beautify.
</PERICLES>

<THAISA>	<99%>
	Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,
	My father's dead.
</THAISA>

<PERICLES>	<99%>
	Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,
	We'll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves
	Will in that kingdom spend our following days;
	Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.
	Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay
	To hear the rest untold. Sir, lead's the way.

</STAGE DIR>
	In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard
	Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:
	In Pericles, his queen, and daughter, seen—
	Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen—
	Virtue preserv'd from fell destruction's blast,
	Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last.
	In Helicanus may you well descry
	A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty.
	In reverend Cerimon there well appears
	The worth that learned charity aye wears.
	For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame
	Had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name
	Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,
	That him and his they in his palace burn:
	The gods for murder seemed so content
	To punish them; although not done, but meant.
	So on your patience evermore attending,
	New joy wait on you! Here our play hath ending.
