	Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
	That's not so, sir; we are your enemies.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
	Whence came you?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
	Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.
	But were you banish'd for so small a fault?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
	We'll have him: Sirs, a word.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
	And I for such like petty crimes as these.
	But to the purpose; for we cite our faults,
	That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives;
	And, partly, seeing you are beautified
	With goodly shape, and by your own report
	A linguist, and a man of such perfection
	As we do in our quality much wantâ€”
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	Come, come,
	Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
	Where is the gentleman that was with her?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
	Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave.
	Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,
	And will not use a woman lawlessly.
