	Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
	Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
	Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
	Wish me partaker in thy happiness
	When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
	If ever danger do environ thee,
	Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
	For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	That's a deep story of a deeper love;
	For he was more than over shoes in love.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	What?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.

<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	He after honour hunts, I after love:
	He leaves his friends to dignify them more;
	I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.
	Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphos'd me;—
	Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
	War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
	Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.

	Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,

<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	True, and thy master a shepherd.

	Well, sir, here is for your pains <STAGE DIR>

	Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wrack;
	Which cannot perish, having thee aboard,
	Being destin'd to a drier death on shore.—
	I must go send some better messenger:
	I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,
	Receiving them from such a worthless post.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!
	Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;
	Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
	O! that our fathers would applaud our loves,
	To seal our happiness with their consents!
	O heavenly Julia!
<SPEECH 35><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two
	Of commendations sent from Valentine,
	Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	There is no news, my lord; but that he writes
	How happily he lives, how well belov'd
	And daily graced by the emperor;
	Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	As one relying on your lordship's will
	And not depending on his friendly wish.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	My lord, I cannot be so soon provided:
	Please you, deliberate a day or two.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
	And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.
	I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,
	Lest he should take exceptions to my love;
	And with the vantage of mine own excuse
	Hath he excepted most against my love.
	O! how this spring of love resembleth
	The uncertain glory of an April day,
	Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
	And by and by a cloud takes all away!
<SPEECH 40><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto,
	And yet a thousand times it answers, 'no.'
<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
	Have patience, gentle Julia.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
	When possibly I can, I will return.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	Why, then, we'll make exchange: here, take you this.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	Here is my hand for my true constancy;
	And when that hour o'erslips me in the day
	Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,
	The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
	Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!
	My father stays my coming; answer not.
	The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears;
	That tide will stay me longer than I should.
	Julia, farewell.
	What! gone without a word?
	Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak;
	For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	Go; I come, I come.
	Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	Not so, sweet lady; but too mean a servant
	To have a look of such a worthy mistress.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	My duty will I boast of, nothing else.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	I'll die on him that says so but yourself.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	That you are worthless.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	We'll both attend upon your ladyship.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	Your friends are well and have them much commended.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
	I left them all in health.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
	My tales of love were wont to weary you;
	I know you joy not in a love-discourse.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
	Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
	Was this the idol that you worship so?
<SPEECH 55><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
	No; but she is an earthly paragon.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
	I will not flatter her.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
	When I was sick you gave me bitter pills,
	And I must minister the like to you.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
	Except my mistress.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
	Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
<SPEECH 60><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
	Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?
<SPEECH 61><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
	Then, let her alone.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 2><SCENE 4><37%>
	But she loves you?
<SPEECH 63><ACT 2><SCENE 4><37%>
	Go on before, I shall inquire you forth:
	I must unto the road, to disembark
	Some necessaries that I needs must use,
	And then I'll presently attend you.
<SPEECH 64><ACT 2><SCENE 4><37%>
	I will.
	Even as one heat another heat expels,
	Or as one nail by strength drives out another,
	So the remembrance of my former love
	Is by a newer object quite forgotten.
	Is it mine eye, or Valentinus' praise,
	Her true perfection, or my false transgression,
	That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
	She's fair; and so is Julia that I love,—
	That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd,
	Which, like a waxen image 'gainst a fire,
	Bears no impression of the thing it was.
	Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,
	And that I love him not as I was wont:
	O! but I love his lady too-too much;
	And that's the reason I love him so little.
	How shall I dote on her with more advice,
	That thus without advice begin to love her?
	'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
	And that hath dazzled my reason's light;
	But when I look on her perfections,
	There is no reason but I shall be blind.
	If I can check my erring love, I will;
	If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.
<SPEECH 65><ACT 2><SCENE 6><41%>
	To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;
	To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;
	To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;
	And even that power which gave me first my oath
	Provokes me to this threefold perjury:
	Love bade me swear, and Love bids me forswear.
	O sweet-suggesting Love! if thou hast sinn'd,
	Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it.
	At first I did adore a twinkling star,
	But now I worship a celestial sun.
	Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken;
	And he wants wit that wants resolved will
	To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.
	Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,
	Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd
	With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.
	I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;
	But there I leave to love where I should love.
	Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:
	If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;
	If I lose them, thus find I by their loss,
	For Valentine, myself; for Julia, Silvia.
	I to myself am dearer than a friend,
	For love is still most precious in itself;
	And Silvia—witness heaven that made her fair!—
	Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
	I will forget that Julia is alive,
	Remembering that my love to her is dead;
	And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,
	Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.
	I cannot now prove constant to myself
	Without some treachery us'd to Valentine:
	This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
	To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,
	Myself in counsel, his competitor.
	Now presently, I'll give her father notice
	Of their disguising and pretended flight;
	Who, all enrag'd, will banish Valentine;
	For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;
	But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross,
	By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.
	Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
	As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!
<SPEECH 66><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	My gracious lord, that which I would discover
	The law of friendship bids me to conceal;
	But when I call to mind your gracious favours
	Done to me, undeserving as I am,
	My duty pricks me on to utter that
	Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
	Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
	This night intends to steal away your daughter:
	Myself am one made privy to the plot.
	I know you have determin'd to bestow her
	On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;
	And should she thus be stol'n away from you
	It would be much vexation to your age.
	Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose
	To cross my friend in his intended drift,
	Than, by concealing it, heap on your head
	A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
	Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.
<SPEECH 67><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Know, noble lord, they have devis'd a mean
	How he her chamber-window will ascend
	And with a corded ladder fetch her down;
	For which the youthful lover now is gone
	And this way comes he with it presently;
	Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.
	But, good my lord, do it so cunningly
	That my discovery be not aimed at;
	For love of you, not hate unto my friend,
	Hath made me publisher of this pretence.
<SPEECH 68><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	Adieu, my lord: Sir Valentine is coming.
<SPEECH 69><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
	Run, boy; run, run, and seek him out.
<SPEECH 70><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
	What seest thou?
<SPEECH 71><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
	Valentine?
<SPEECH 72><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
	Who then? his spirit?
<SPEECH 73><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
	What then?
<SPEECH 74><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
	Who would'st thou strike?
<SPEECH 75><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
	Villain, forbear.
<SPEECH 76><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
	Sirrah, I say, forbear.—Friend Valentine, a word.
<SPEECH 77><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
	Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,
	For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.
<SPEECH 78><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
	No, Valentine.
<SPEECH 79><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
	No, Valentine.
<SPEECH 80><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
	That thou art banished, O, that's the news,
	From hence, from Silvia, and from me thy friend.
<SPEECH 81><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
	Ay, ay; and she hath offer'd to the doom—
	Which, unrevers'd, stands in effectual force—
	A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:
	Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd;
	With them, upon her knees, her humble self;
	Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them
	As if but now they waxed pale for woe:
	But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,
	Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,
	Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;
	But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die.
	Besides, her intercession chaf'd him so,
	When she for thy repeal was suppliant,
	That to close prison he commanded her,
	With many bitter threats of biding there.
<SPEECH 82><ACT 3><SCENE 1><57%>
	Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,
	And study help for that which thou lament'st.
	Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.
	Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;
	Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.
	Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that
	And manage it against despairing thoughts.
	Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence;
	Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver'd
	Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.
	The time now serves not to expostulate:
	Come, I'll convey thee through the city-gate,
	And, ere I part with thee, confer at large
	Of all that may concern thy love-affairs.
	As thou lov'st Silvia, though not for thyself,
	Regard thy danger, and along with me!
<SPEECH 83><ACT 3><SCENE 1><58%>
	Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.
<SPEECH 84><ACT 3><SCENE 2><63%>
	Gone, my good lord.
<SPEECH 85><ACT 3><SCENE 2><63%>
	A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.
<SPEECH 86><ACT 3><SCENE 2><64%>
	Longer than I prove loyal to your Grace
	Let me not live to look upon your Grace.
<SPEECH 87><ACT 3><SCENE 2><64%>
	I do, my lord.
<SPEECH 88><ACT 3><SCENE 2><64%>
	She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.
<SPEECH 89><ACT 3><SCENE 2><64%>
	The best way is to slander Valentine
	With falsehood, cowardice, and poor descent,
	Three things that women highly hold in hate.
<SPEECH 90><ACT 3><SCENE 2><64%>
	Ay, if his enemy deliver it:
	Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
	By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.
<SPEECH 91><ACT 3><SCENE 2><65%>
	And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:
	'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,
	Especially against his very friend.
<SPEECH 92><ACT 3><SCENE 2><65%>
	You have prevail'd, my lord. If I can do it,
	By aught that I can speak in his dispraise,
	She shall not long continue love to him.
	But say this weed her love from Valentine,
	It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.
<SPEECH 93><ACT 3><SCENE 2><66%>
	As much as I can do I will effect.
	But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;
	You must lay lime to tangle her desires
	By wailful sonnets, whose composed rimes
	Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
<SPEECH 94><ACT 3><SCENE 2><66%>
	Say that upon the altar of her beauty
	You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart.
	Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears
	Moist it again, and frame some feeling line
	That may discover such integrity:
	For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,
	Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,
	Make tigers tame and huge leviathans
	Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
	After your dire-lamenting elegies,
	Visit by night your lady's chamber-window
	With some sweet consort: to their instruments
	Tune a deploring dump; the night's dead silence
	Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.
	This, or else nothing, will inherit her.
<SPEECH 95><ACT 3><SCENE 2><67%>
	We'll wait upon your grace till aftersupper,
	And afterward determine our proceedings.
<SPEECH 96><ACT 4><SCENE 2><71%>
	Already have I been false to Valentine,
	And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.
	Under the colour of commending him,
	I have access my own love to prefer:
	But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,
	To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
	When I protest true loyalty to her,
	She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;
	When to her beauty I commend my vows,
	She bids me think how I have been forsworn
	In breaking faith with Julia whom I lov'd:
	And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
	The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,
	Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,
	The more it grows, and fawneth on her still.
	But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,
	And give some evening music to her ear.
<SPEECH 97><ACT 4><SCENE 2><71%>
	Ay, gentle Thurio; for you know that love
	Will creep in service where it cannot go.
<SPEECH 98><ACT 4><SCENE 2><72%>
	Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.
<SPEECH 99><ACT 4><SCENE 2><72%>
	Ay, Silvia, for your sake.
<SPEECH 100><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
	Sir Thurio, fear not you: I will so plead
	That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
<SPEECH 101><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
	At Saint Gregory's well.
<SPEECH 102><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
	Madam, good even to your ladyship.
<SPEECH 103><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
	One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,

<SPEECH 104><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
	Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.
<SPEECH 105><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
	That I may compass yours.
<SPEECH 106><ACT 4><SCENE 2><75%>
	I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;
	But she is dead.
<SPEECH 107><ACT 4><SCENE 2><75%>
	I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.
<SPEECH 108><ACT 4><SCENE 2><75%>
	Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.
<SPEECH 109><ACT 4><SCENE 2><76%>
	Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,
	Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,
	The picture that is hanging in your chamber:
	To that I'll speak, to that I'll sigh and weep;
	For since the substance of your perfect self
	Is else devoted, I am but a shadow,
	And to your shadow will I make true love.
<SPEECH 110><ACT 4><SCENE 2><76%>
	As wretches have o'er night

	</STAGE DIR> How now, you whoreson peasant!
	Where have you been these two days loitering?
<SPEECH 113><ACT 4><SCENE 4><81%>
	And what says she to my little jewel?
<SPEECH 114><ACT 4><SCENE 4><81%>
	But she received my dog?
<SPEECH 115><ACT 4><SCENE 4><81%>
	What! didst thou offer her this from me?

	Go, get thee hence, and find my dog again,
	Or ne'er return again into my sight.
	Away, I say! Stay'st thou to vex me here?
	A slave that still an end turns me to shame.
	Sebastian, I have entertained thee
	Partly, that I have need of such a youth,
	That can with some discretion do my business,
	For't is no trusting to yond foolish lout;
	But chiefly for thy face and thy behaviour,
	Which, if my augury deceive me not,
	Witness good bringing up, fortune, and truth:
	Therefore, know thou, for this I entertain thee.
	Go presently, and take this ring with thee.
	Deliver it to Madam Silvia:
	She lov'd me well deliver'd it to me.
<SPEECH 117><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	Not so: I think, she lives.
<SPEECH 118><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>

<SPEECH 119><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	Wherefore should'st thou pity her?
<SPEECH 120><ACT 4><SCENE 4><83%>
	Well, well, give her that ring and therewithal
	This letter: that's her chamber. Tell my lady
	I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.
	Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,
	Where thou shalt find me sad and solitary.
<SPEECH 121><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	O, sir, I find her milder than she was;

	She says it is a fair one.
<SPEECH 124><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	But pearls are fair, and the old saying is,
	'Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.'
<SPEECH 125><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	Ill, when you talk of war.
<SPEECH 126><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.
<SPEECH 127><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	That you are well deriv'd.
<SPEECH 128><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	O, ay; and pities them.
<SPEECH 129><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	That they are out by lease.
<SPEECH 130><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	Nor I.
<SPEECH 131><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	Neither.
<SPEECH 132><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	And I will follow, more for Silvia's love
	Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.
<SPEECH 133><ACT 5><SCENE 4><93%>
	Madam, this service I have done for you—
	Though you respect not aught your servant doth—
	To hazard life and rescue you from him
	That would have forc'd your honour and your love.
	Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look;
	A smaller boon than this I cannot beg,
	And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.
<SPEECH 134><ACT 5><SCENE 4><94%>
	Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
	But by my coming I have made you happy.
<SPEECH 135><ACT 5><SCENE 4><94%>
	What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
	Would I not undergo for one calm look!
	O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approv'd,
	When women cannot love where they're belov'd!
<SPEECH 136><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
	In love
	Who respects friend?
<SPEECH 137><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
	Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
	Can no way change you to a milder form,
	I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,
	And love you 'gainst the nature of love,—force ye.
<SPEECH 138><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
	I'll force thee yield to my desire.
<SPEECH 139><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
	Valentine!
<SPEECH 140><ACT 5><SCENE 4><96%>
	My shame and guilt confound me.
	Forgive me, Valentine. If hearty sorrow
	Be a sufficient ransom for offence,
	I tender't here: I do as truly suffer
	As e'er I did commit.
<SPEECH 141><ACT 5><SCENE 4><96%>
	Look to the boy.
<SPEECH 142><ACT 5><SCENE 4><96%>
	Where is that ring, boy?
<SPEECH 143><ACT 5><SCENE 4><96%>
	How! let me see.
	Why this is the ring I gave to Julia.
<SPEECH 144><ACT 5><SCENE 4><97%>
	But how cam'st thou by this ring?
	At my depart I gave this unto Julia.
<SPEECH 145><ACT 5><SCENE 4><97%>
	How! Julia!
<SPEECH 146><ACT 5><SCENE 4><97%>
	Than men their minds! 'tis true. O heaven! were man
	But constant, he were perfect: that one error
	Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:
	Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
	What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy
	More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?
<SPEECH 147><ACT 5><SCENE 4><98%>
	Bear witness, heaven, I have my wish, for ever.
