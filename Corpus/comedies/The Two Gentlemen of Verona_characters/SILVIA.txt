	Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	I thank you, gentle servant. 'Tis very clerkly done.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;
	And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;
	And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,
	Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Yes, yes: the lines are very quaintly writ,
	But since unwillingly, take them again:
	Nay, take them.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Ay, ay; you writ them, sir, at my request,
	But I will none of them; they are for you.
	I would have had them writ more movingly.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	And when it's writ, for my sake read it over:
	And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Why, if it please you, take it for your labour:
	And so, good morrow, servant.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 4><29%>
	Servant!
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
	Servant, you are sad.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
	What, angry, Sir Thurio! do you change colour?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
	A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
	Who is that, servant?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 4><31%>
	No more, gentlemen, no more. Here comes my father.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
	Belike that now she hath enfranchis'd them
	Upon some other pawn for fealty.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
	Nay, then he should be blind; and, being blind,
	How could he see his way to seek out you?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
	Have done, have done. Here comes the gentleman.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
	His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
	If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	And duty never yet did want his meed.
	Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	That you are welcome?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	I wait upon his pleasure. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Come, Sir Thurio,
	Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:
	I'll leave you to confer of home-affairs;
	When you have done, we look to hear from you.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
	I thank you for your music, gentlemen.
	Who is that that spake?
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
	Sir Proteus, as I take it.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
	What is your will?
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
	You have your wish; my will is even this:
	That presently you hie you home to bed.
	Thou subtle, perjur'd, false, disloyal man!
	Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,
	To be seduced by thy flattery,
	That hast deceiv'd so many with thy vows?
	Return, return, and make thy love amends.
	For me, by this pale queen of night I swear,
	I am so far from granting thy request
	That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,
	And by and by intend to chide myself
	Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 2><75%>
	Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend
	Survives; to whom, thyself art witness
	I am betroth'd: and art thou not asham'd
	To wrong him with thy importunacy?
<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 2><75%>
	And so suppose am I; for in his grave, Assure thyself my love is buried.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 2><75%>
	Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence;
	Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 2><76%>
	I am very loath to be your idol, sir;
	But, since your falsehood shall become you well
	To worship shadows and adore false shapes,
	Send to me in the morning and I'll send it.
	And so, good rest.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	Who calls?
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman—
	Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not—
	Valiant, wise, remorseful, well-accomplish'd.
	Thou art not ignorant what dear good will
	I bear unto the banish'd Valentine,
	Nor how my father would enforce me marry
	Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.
	Thyself hast lov'd; and I have heard thee say
	No grief did ever come so near thy heart
	As when thy lady and thy true love died,
	Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity.
	Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,
	To Mantua, where, I hear he makes abode;
	And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,
	I do desire thy worthy company,
	Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
	Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour,
	But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,
	And on the justice of my flying hence,
	To keep me from a most unholy match,
	Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.
	I do desire thee, even from a heart
	As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,
	To bear me company and go with me:
	If not, to hide what I have said to thee,
	That I may venture to depart alone.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	This evening coming.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	At Friar Patrick's cell,
	Where I intend holy confession.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 3><79%>
	Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	What would you with her, if that I be she?
<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	From whom?
<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	O! he sends you for a picture?
<SPEECH 40><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	Ursula, bring my picture there.
	Go, give your master this: tell him from me,
	One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
	Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	I pray thee, let me look on that again.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	There, hold.
	I will not look upon your master's lines:
	I know, they are stuff'd with protestations
	And full of new-found oaths, which he will break
	As easily as I do tear his paper.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 4><SCENE 4><85%>
	The more shame for him that he sends it me;
	For, I have heard him say a thousand times,
	His Julia gave it him at his departure.
	Though his false finger have profan'd the ring,
	Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 4><SCENE 4><85%>
	What say'st thou?
<SPEECH 45><ACT 4><SCENE 4><85%>
	Dost thou know her?
<SPEECH 46><ACT 4><SCENE 4><85%>
	Belike, she thinks, that Proteus hath forsook her.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 4><SCENE 4><85%>
	Is she not passing fair?
<SPEECH 48><ACT 4><SCENE 4><86%>
	How tall was she?
<SPEECH 49><ACT 4><SCENE 4><86%>
	She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.—
	Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
	I weep myself to think upon thy words.
	Here, youth, there is my purse: I give thee this
	For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lov'st her.
	Farewell.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	Amen, amen! go on, good Eglamour,
	Out at the postern by the abbey-wall.
	I fear I am attended by some spies.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	A thousand more mischances than this one
	Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
	O Valentine! this I endure for thee.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 5><SCENE 4><94%>
	O, miserable, unhappy that I am!
<SPEECH 54><ACT 5><SCENE 4><94%>
	By thy approach thou mak'st me most unhappy.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 5><SCENE 4><94%>
	Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
	I would have been a breakfast to the beast,
	Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
	O! heaven be judge how I love Valentine,
	Whose life's as tender to me as my soul,
	And full as much—for more there cannot be—
	I do detest false perjur'd Proteus.
	Therefore be gone, solicit me no more.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 5><SCENE 4><94%>
	When Proteus cannot love where he's belov'd.
	Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
	For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
	Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths
	Descended into perjury to love me.
	Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two,
	And that's far worse than none: better have none
	Than plural faith which is too much by one.
	Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!
<SPEECH 57><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
	All men but Proteus.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
	O heaven!
