	This is the hour that Madam Silvia
	Entreated me to call, and know her mind:
	There's some great matter she'd employ me in.
	Madam, Madam!
<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	Your servant, and your friend;
	One that attends your ladyship's command.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	As many, worthy lady, to yourself.
	According to your ladyship's impose,
	I am thus early come to know what service
	It is your pleasure to command me in.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	Madam, I pity much your grievances;
	Which since I know they virtuously are plac'd,
	I give consent to go along with you,
	Recking as little what betideth me
	As much I wish all good befortune you.
	When will you go?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	Where shall I meet you?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	I will not fail your ladyship.
	Good morrow, gentle lady.

	The sun begins to gild the western sky,
	And now it is about the very hour
	That Silvia at Friar Patrick's cell should meet me.
	She will not fail; for lovers break not hours,
	Unless it be to come before their time,
	So much they spur their expedition.
	See, where she comes.
	Lady, a happy evening!

	Fear not: the forest is not three leagues off;
	If we recover that, we're sure enough.
