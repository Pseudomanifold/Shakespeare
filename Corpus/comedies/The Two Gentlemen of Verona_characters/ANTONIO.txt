	Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
	Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	Why, what of him?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
	Whereon this month I have been hammering.
	I have consider'd well his loss of time,
	And how he cannot be a perfect man,
	Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:
	Experience is by industry achiev'd
	And perfected by the swift course of time.
	Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	I know it well.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	I like thy counsel, well hast thou advis'd:
	And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it
	The execution of it shall make known.
	Even with the speediest expedition
	I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	Good company; with them shall Proteus go:
	And in good time:â€”now will we break with him.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	How now! what letter are you reading there?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	And how stand you affected to his wish?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	My will is something sorted with his wish.
	Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;
	For what I will, I will, and there an end.
	I am resolv'd that thou shalt spend some time
	With Valentinus in the emperor's court:
	What maintenance he from his friends receives,
	Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.
	To-morrow be in readiness to go:
	Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	Look, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee:
	No more of stay; to-morrow thou must go.
	Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ'd
	To hasten on his expedition.
