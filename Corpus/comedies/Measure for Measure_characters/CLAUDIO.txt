	Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?
	Bear me to prison, where I am committed.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	Thus can the demi-god Authority
	Make us pay down for our offence' by weight.
	The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;
	On whom it will not, so: yet still 'tis just.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
	As surfeit is the father of much fast,
	So every scope by the immoderate use
	Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue—
	Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,—
	A thirsty evil, and when we drink we die.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	What but to speak of would offend again.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	No.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	Call it so.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
	I got possession of Julietta's bed:
	You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
	Save that we do the denunciation lack
	Of outward order: this we came not to,
	Only for propagation of a dower
	Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
	From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
	Till time had made them for us. But it chances
	The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
	With character too gross is writ on Juliet.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	Unhappily, even so.
	And the new deputy now for the duke,—
	Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
	Or whether that the body public be
	A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
	Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
	He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
	Whether the tyranny be in his place,
	Or in his eminence that fills it up,
	I stagger in:—but this new governor
	Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
	Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall
	So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round,
	And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
	Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
	Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	I have done so, but he's not to be found.
	I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service.
	This day my sister should the cloister enter,
	And there receive her approbation:
	Acquaint her with the danger of my state;
	Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
	To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:
	I have great hope in that; for in her youth
	There is a prone and speechless dialect,
	Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
	When she will play with reason and discourse,
	And well she can persuade.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	I thank you, good friend Lucio.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	Come, officer, away!
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	The miserable have no other medicine

	I have hope to live, and am prepar'd to die.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	I humbly thank you.
	To sue to live, I find I seek to die,
	And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	Most holy sir, I thank you.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Now, sister, what's the comfort?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Is there no remedy?
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	But is there any?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Perpetual durance?
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	But in what nature?
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Let me know the point.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	Why give you me this shame?
	Think you I can a resolution fetch
	From flowery tenderness? If I must die,
	I will encounter darkness as a bride,
	And hug it in mine arms.

	O heavens! it cannot be.

	Thou shalt not do't.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Thanks, dear Isabel.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Yes. Has he affections in him,
	That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,
	When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin;
	Or of the deadly seven it is the least.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	If it were damnable, he being so wise,
	Why would he for the momentary trick
	Be perdurably fin'd? O Isabel!
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Death is a fearful thing.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
	To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
	This sensible warm motion to become
	A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
	To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
	In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
	To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
	And blown with restless violence round about
	The pendant world; or to be worse than worst
	Of those that lawless and incertain thoughts
	Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!
	The weariest and most loathed worldly life
	That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
	Can lay on nature is a paradise
	To what we fear of death.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Sweet sister, let me live:
	What sin you do to save a brother's life,
	Nature dispenses with the deed so far
	That it becomes a virtue.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	Nay, hear me, Isabel.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	O hear me, Isabella.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love with life that I will sue to be rid of it.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
	When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones;
	He will not wake.
