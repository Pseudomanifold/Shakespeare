	O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
	O night, which ever art when day is not!
	O night! O night! alack, alack, alack!
	I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot.
	And thou, O wall! O sweet, O lovely wall!
	That stand'st between her father's ground and mine;
	Thou wall, O wall! O sweet, and lovely wall!
	Show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne.
	Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!
	But what see I? No Thisby do I see.
	O wicked wall! through whom I see no bliss;
	Curs'd be thy stones for thus deceiving me!
<SPEECH 2><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me,' is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	I see a voice: now will I to the chink,
	To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face.
	Thisby.

	Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
	And, like Limander, am I trusty still.

	Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.

	O! kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.

	Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?

	Sweet moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
	I thank thee, moon, for shining now so bright,
	For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering streams,
	I trust to taste of truest Thisby's sight.
	But stay, O spite!
	But mark, poor knight,
	What dreadful dole is here!
	Eyes, do you see?
	How can it be?
	O dainty duck! O dear!
	Thy mantle good,
	What! stain'd with blood!
	Approach, ye Furies fell!
	O Fates, come, come,
	Cut thread and thrum;
	Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!
<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
	O! wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
	Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear?
	Which is—no, no—which was the fairest dame
	That liv'd, that lov'd, that lik'd, that look'd with cheer.
	Come tears, confound;
	Out, sword, and wound
	The pap of Pyramus:
	Ay, that left pap,
	Where heart doth hop:
	Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
	Now am I dead,
	Now am I fled;
	My soul is in the sky:
	Tongue, lose thy light!
	Moon, take thy flight!
	Now die, die, die, die, die.
