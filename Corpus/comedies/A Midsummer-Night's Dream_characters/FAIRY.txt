	Over hill, over dale,
	Thorough bush, thorough brier,
	Over park, over pale,
	Thorough flood, thorough fire,
	I do wander every where,
	Swifter than the moone's sphere;
	And I serve the fairy queen,
	To dew her orbs upon the green:
	The cowslips tall her pensioners be;
	In their gold coats spots you see;
	Those be rubies, fairy favours,
	In their freckles live their savours:
	I must go seek some dew-drops here,
	And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
	Farewell, thou lob of spirits: I'll be gone;
	Our queen and all her elves come here anon.

	Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
	Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
	Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are you not he
	That frights the maidens of the villagery;
	Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern,
	And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;
	And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;
	Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
	Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,
	You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
	Are you not he?

	And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!

	Hence, away! now all is well.
	One aloof stand sentinel.
