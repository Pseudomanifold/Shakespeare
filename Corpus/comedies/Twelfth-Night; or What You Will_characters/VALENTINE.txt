	So please my lord, I might not be admitted;
	But from her handmaid do return this answer:
	The element itself, till seven years' heat,
	Shall not behold her face at ample view;
	But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk,
	And water once a day her chamber round
	With eve-offending brine: all this, to season
	A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
	And lasting in her sad remembrance.

	If the duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hath known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 4><10%>
	No, believe me.
