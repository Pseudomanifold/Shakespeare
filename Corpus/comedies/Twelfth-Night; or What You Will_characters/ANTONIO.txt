	Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Alas the day!
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	If you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
	I have many enemies in Orsino's court,
	Else would I very shortly see thee there;
	But, come what may, I do adore thee so,
	That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
	I could not stay behind you: my desire,
	More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;
	And not all love to see you,—though so much
	As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,—
	But jealousy what might befall your travel,
	Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,
	Unguided and unfriended, often prove
	Rough and unhospitable: my willing love,
	The rather by these arguments of fear,
	Set forth in your pursuit.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
	To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
	Would you'd pardon me;
	I do not without danger walk these streets:
	Once, in a sea-fight 'gainst the Count his galleys,
	I did some service; of such note indeed,
	That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
	The offence is not of such a bloody nature,
	Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
	Might well have given us bloody argument.
	It might have since been answer'd in repaying
	What we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,
	Most of our city did: only myself stood out;
	For which, if I be lapsed in this place,
	I shall pay dear.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
	It doth not fit me. Hold, sir; here's my purse.
	In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,
	Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,
	Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
	With viewing of the town: there shall you have me.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
	You have desire to purchase; and your store,
	I think, is not for idle markets, sir.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	To the Elephant.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 4><71%>
	Put up your sword. If this young gentleman
	Have done offence, I take the fault on me:
	If you offend him, I for him defy you.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 4><71%>
	One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more
	Than you have heard him brag to you he will.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 4><72%>
	You do mistake me, sir.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 4><72%>
	I must obey.—<STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> This comes with seeking you:
	But there's no remedy: I shall answer it.
	What will you do, now my necessity
	Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me
	Much more for what I cannot do for you
	Than what befalls myself. You stand amaz'd:
	But be of comfort.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 4><72%>
	I must entreat of you some of that money.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 4><73%>
	Will you deny me now?
	Is't possible that my deserts to you
	Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,
	Lest that it make me so unsound a man
	As to upbraid you with those kindnesses
	That I have done for you.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 4><73%>
	O heavens themselves!
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 4><73%>
	Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here
	I snatch'd one-half out of the jaws of death,
	Reliev'd him with such sanctity of love,
	And to his image, which methought did promise
	Most venerable worth, did I devotion.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 4><73%>
	But O! how vile an idol proves this god.
	Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.
	In nature there's no blemish but the mind;
	None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
	Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil
	Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 4><74%>
	Lead me on.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Orsino, noble sir,
	Be pleas'd that I shake off these names you give me:
	Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,
	Though I confess, on base and ground enough,
	Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:
	That most ingrateful boy there by your side,
	From the rude sea's enrag'd and foamy mouth
	Did I redeem; a wrack past hope he was:
	His life I gave him, and did thereto add
	My love, without retention or restraint,
	All his in dedication; for his sake
	Did I expose myself, pure for his love,
	Into the danger of this adverse town;
	Drew to defend him when he was beset:
	Where being apprehended, his false cunning,
	Not meaning to partake with me in danger,
	Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,
	And grew a twenty years removed thing
	While one would wink, denied me mine own purse,
	Which I had recommended to his use
	Not half an hour before.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	To-day, my lord; and for three months before,—
	No interim, not a minute's vacancy,—
	Both day and night did we keep company.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	Sebastian are you?
<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	How have you made division of yourself?
	An apple cleft in two is not more twin
	Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
