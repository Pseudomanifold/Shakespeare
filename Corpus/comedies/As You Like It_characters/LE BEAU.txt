	Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	What colour, madam! How shall
	I answer you?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please your ladyships, you may see the end, for the best is yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	There comes an old man and his three sons,—
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence;—
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him: so he served the second, and so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man, their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	Why, this that I speak of.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	You must, if you stay here; for here is the place appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	Even he, madam.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	Monsieur the challenger, the princes call for you.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 2><14%>
	He cannot speak, my lord.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 2><16%>
	Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
	To leave this place. Albeit you have deserv'd
	High commendation, true applause and love,
	Yet such is now the duke's condition
	That he misconstrues all that you have done.
	The duke is humorous: what he is indeed,
	More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 2><16%>
	Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners:
	But yet, indeed the smaller is his daughter:
	The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,
	And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
	To keep his daughter company; whose loves
	Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
	But I can tell you that of late this duke
	Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
	Grounded upon no other argument
	But that the people praise her for her virtues,
	And pity her for her good father's sake;
	And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
	Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:
	Hereafter, in a better world than this,
	I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
