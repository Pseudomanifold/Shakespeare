	Yonder comes my master, your brother.

	</STAGE DIR> Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's remembrance, be at accord.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in your service. God be with my old master! he would not have spoke such a word.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 3><26%>
	What! my young master? O my gentle master!
	O my sweet master! O you memory
	Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?
	Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you?
	And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?
	Why would you be so fond to overcome
	The bony priser of the humorous duke?
	Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
	Know you not, master, to some kind of men
	Their graces serve them but as enemies?
	No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,
	Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
	O, what a world is this, when what is comely
	Envenoms him that bears it!
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 3><26%>
	O unhappy youth!
	Come not within these doors; within this roof
	The enemy of all your graces lives.
	Your brother,—no, no brother; yet the son,—
	Yet not the son, I will not call him son
	Of him I was about to call his father,—
	Hath heard your praises, and this night he means
	To burn the lodging where you use to lie,
	And you within it: if he fail of that,
	He will have other means to cut you off.
	I overheard him and his practices.
	This is no place; this house is but a butchery:
	Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 3><27%>
	No matter whither, so you come not here.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 3><27%>
	But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
	The thrifty hire I sav'd under your father,
	Which I did store to be my foster-nurse
	When service should in my old limbs lie lame,
	And unregarded age in corners thrown.
	Take that; and He that doth the ravens feed,
	Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
	Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
	All this I give you. Let me be your servant:
	Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
	For in my youth I never did apply
	Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
	Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
	The means of weakness and debility;
	Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
	Frosty, but kindly. Let me go with you;
	I'll do the service of a younger man
	In all your business and necessities.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 3><28%>
	Master, go on, and I will follow thee
	To the last gasp with truth and loyalty.
	From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
	Here lived I, but now live here no more.
	At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;
	But at fourscore it is too late a week:
	Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
	Than to die well and not my master's debtor.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
	Dear master, I can go no further: O! I die for food. Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 7><41%>
	So had you need:
	I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.
