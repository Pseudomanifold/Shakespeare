	This is the tenour of the emperor's writ:
	That since the common men are now in action
	'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,
	And that the legions now in Gallia are
	Full weak to undertake our wars against
	The fall'n-off Britons, that we do incite
	The gentry to this business. He creates
	Lucius pro-consul; and to you the tribunes,
	For this immediate levy, he commends
	His absolute commission. Long live CÃ¦sar!
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 7><58%>
	With those legions
	Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy
	Must be supplyant; the words of your commission
	Will tie you to the numbers and the time
	Of their dispatch.
