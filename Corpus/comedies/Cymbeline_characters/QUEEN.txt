	No, be assur'd you shall not find me, daughter,
	After the slander of most step-mothers,
	Evil-ey'd unto you; you're my prisoner, but
	Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
	That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,
	So soon as I can win the offended king,
	I will be known your advocate; marry, yet
	The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good
	You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience
	Your wisdom may inform you.

	You know the peril:
	I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying

	Hath charg'd you should not speak together.

	Be brief, I pray you;
	If the king come, I shall incur I know not
	How much of his displeasure. <STAGE DIR>

	Beseech your patience. Peace!

	Ha!

	Dispatch.
	Now, Master doctor, have you brought those drugs?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
	I wonder, doctor,
	Thou ask'st me such a question: have I not been
	Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how
	To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so
	That our great king himself doth woo me oft
	For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,—
	Unless thou think'st me devilish,—is 't not meet
	That I did amplify my judgment in
	Other conclusions? I will try the forces
	Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
	We count not worth the hanging,—but none human,—
	To try the vigour of them and apply
	Allayments to their act, and by them gather
	Their several virtues and effects.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
	O! content thee.
	</STAGE DIR> Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him
	Will I first work: he's for his master,
	And enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio:
	Doctor, your service for this time is ended;
	Take your own way.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
	</STAGE DIR> Hark thee, a word.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 5><15%>
	No further service, doctor,
	Until I send for thee.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 5><15%>
	Weeps she still, sayst thou? Dost thou think in time
	She will not quench, and let instructions enter
	Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:
	When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,
	I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
	As great as is thy master; greater, for
	His fortunes all lie speechless, and his name
	Is at last gasp; return he cannot, nor
	Continue where he is; to shift his being
	Is to exchange one misery with another,
	And every day that comes comes to decay
	A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,
	To be depender on a thing that leans,
	Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,
	So much as but to prop him?
	Thou tak'st up
	Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:
	It is a thing I made, which hath the king
	Five times redeem'd from death; I do not know
	What is more cordial: nay, I prithee, take it;
	It is an earnest of a further good
	That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
	The case stands with her; do 't as from thyself.
	Think what a chance thou changest on, but think
	Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,
	Who shall take notice of thee. I'll move the king
	To any shape of thy preferment such
	As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,
	That set thee on to this desert, am bound
	To load thy merit richly. Call my women;
	Think on my words.
	A sly and constant knave,
	Not to be shak'd; the agent for his master,
	And the remembrancer of her to hold
	The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that
	Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her
	Of leigers for her sweet, and which she after,
	Except she bend her humour, shall be assur'd
	To taste of too.
	So, so;—well done, well done.
	The violets, cowslips, and the prime-roses
	Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio:
	Think on my words.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 3><27%>
	You are most bound to the king,
	Who lets go by no vantages that may
	Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself
	To orderly soliciting, and be friended
	With aptness of the season; make denials
	Increase your services; so seem as if
	You were inspir'd to do those duties which
	You tender to her; that you in all obey her
	Save when command to your dismission tends,
	And therein you are senseless.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 1><37%>
	And, to kill the marvel,
	Shall be so ever.

	That opportunity,
	Which then they had to take from 's, to resume,
	We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,
	The kings your ancestors, together with
	The natural bravery of your isle, which stands
	As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in
	With rocks unscaleable and roaring waters,
	With sands, that will not bear your enemies' boats,
	But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest
	Cæsar made here, but made not here his brag
	Of 'came, and saw, and overcame:' with shame—
	The first that ever touch'd him—he was carried
	From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping—
	Poor ignorant baubles!—on our terrible seas,
	Like egg-shells mov'd upon their surges, crack'd
	As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof
	The fam'd Cassibelan, who was once at point—
	O giglot fortune!—to master Cæsar's sword,
	Made Lud's town with rejoicing-fires bright,
	And Britons stiut with courage.

	Royal sir.
	Since the exile of Posthumus, most retir'd
	Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,
	'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,
	Forbear sharp speeches to her; she's a lady
	So tender of rebukes that words are strokes,
	And strokes death to her.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 5><51%>
	My lord, when last I went to visit her,
	She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,
	Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,
	She should that duty leave unpaid to you,
	Which daily she was bound to proffer; this
	She wish'd me to make known, but our great court
	Made me to blame in memory.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 5><51%>
	Son, I say, follow the king.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 5><51%>
	Go, look after.
	Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!
	He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence
	Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes
	It is a thing most precious. But for her,
	Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath sciz'd her,
	Or, wing'd with fervour of her love, she's flown
	To her desir'd Posthumus. Gone she is
	To death or to dishonour, and my end
	Can make good use of either; she being down,
	I have the placing of the British crown.
	How now, my son!
<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 5><52%>
	</STAGE DIR> All the better; may
	This night forestall him of the coming day!
