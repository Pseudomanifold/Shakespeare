	My queen! my mistress!
	O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
	To be suspected of more tenderness
	Than doth become a man. I will remain
	The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth.
	My residence in Rome at one Philario's,
	Who to my father was a friend, to me
	Known but by letter; thither write, my queen,
	And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,
	Though ink be made of gall.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Should we be taking leave

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	How! how! another?
	You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
	And sear up my embracements from a next

	While sense can keep it on! And, sweetest, fairest,
	As I my poor self did exchange for you,
	To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles
	I still win of you; for my sake wear this;
	It is a manacle of love; I'll place it

	Alack! the king!

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 4><9%>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 4><10%>
	By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller; rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in my every action to be guided by others' experiences; but, upon my mended judgment,—if I offend not to say it is mended,—my quarrel was not altogether slight.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 4><10%>
	She holds her virtue still and I my mind.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 4><10%>
	Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would abate her nothing, though I profess myself her adorer, not her friend.

<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 4><11%>
	More than the world enjoys.

	You are mistaken; the one may be sold, or given; or if there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit for the gift; the other is not a thing for sale, and only the gift of the gods.

	Which, by their graces, I will keep.

	Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves; notwithstanding I fear not my ring.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 4><11%>
	Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 4><11%>
	No, no.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 4><12%>
	You are a great deal abused in too bold a persuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you're worthy of by your attempt.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 4><12%>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 4><12%>
	I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ring I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.

	This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a graver purpose, I hope.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 4><12%>
	Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your return. Let there be covenants drawn between 's: my mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking; I dare you to this match. Here's my ring.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 4><13%>
	I embrace these conditions; let us have articles betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand that you have prevailed, I am no further your enemy; she is not worth our debate: if she remain unseduced,—you not making it appear otherwise,—for your ill opinion, and the assault you have made to her chastity, you shall answer me with your sword.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 4><13%>
	Agreed.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 4><31%>
	Fear it not, sir; I would I were so sure

	Will remain hers.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 4><31%>
	Not any, but abide the change of time,
	Quake in the present winter's state and wish

	I barely gratify your love; they failing,
	I must die much your debtor.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 4><31%>
	I do believe—
	Statist though I am none, nor like to be—
	That this will prove a war; and you shall hear
	The legions now in Gallia sooner landed
	In our not-fearing Britain, than have tidings
	Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen
	Are men more order'd than when Julius Cæsar
	Smil'd at their lack of skill, but found their courage
	Worthy his frowning at: their discipline,—
	Now winged,—with their courage will make known
	To their approvers they are people such
	That mend upon the world.

<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 4><32%>

	If you can make 't apparent

<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 4><32%>
	Proceed.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
	This is true;

<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
	So they must,
	Or do your honour injury.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
	This is a thing

<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
	This is her honour!
	Let it be granted you have seen all this,—and praise
	Be given to your remembrance,—the description

	The wager you have laid.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
	Jove!
	Once more let me behold it. Is it that
	Which I left with her?
<SPEECH 43><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	May be she pluck'd it off
	To send it me.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	O! no, no, no, 'tis true. Here, take this too;
	It is a basilisk unto mine eye,
	Kills me to look on 't. Let there be no honour
	Where there is beauty; truth where semblance; love
	Where there's another man; the vows of women
	Of no more bondage be to where they are made
	Than they are to their virtues, which is nothing.
	O! above measure false.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	Very true;
	And so I hope he came by 't. Back my ring.
	Render to me some corporal sign about her,
	More evident than this; for this was stol'n.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.
	'Tis true; nay, keep the ring; 'tis true: I am sure
	She would not lose it; her attendants are
	All sworn and honourable; they induc'd to steal it!
	And by a stranger! No, he hath enjoy'd her;
	The cognizance of her incontinency
	Is this; she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly.
	There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell
	Divide themselves between you!
<SPEECH 47><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	Never talk on 't;
	She hath been colted by him.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
	Ay, and it doth confirm

	Were there no more but it.

	Spare your arithmetic; never count the turns;
	Once, and a million!

	No swearing.
	If you will swear you have not done 't, you lie;
	And I will kill thee if thou dost deny
	Thou'st made me cuckold.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
	O! that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal.
	I will go there and do 't, i' the court, before
	Her father. I'll do something—
<SPEECH 52><ACT 2><SCENE 5><35%>
	Is there no way for men to be, but women
	Must be half-workers? We are all bastards; all,
	And that most venerable man which I
	Did call my father was I know not where
	When I was stamp'd; some coiner with his tools
	Made me a counterfeit; yet my mother seem'd
	The Dian of that time; so doth my wife
	The nonpareil of this. O! vengeance, vengeance;
	Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd
	And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with
	A pudency so rosy the sweet view on 't
	Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her
	As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O! all the devils!
	This yellow Iachimo, in an hour,—was 't not?
	Or less—at first?—perchance he spoke not, but
	Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,
	Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no opposition
	But what he look'd for should oppose and she
	Should from encounter guard. Could I find out
	The woman's part in me! For there's no motion
	That tends to vice in man but I affirm
	It is the woman's part; be it lying, note it,
	The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;
	Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;
	Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,
	Nice longing, slanders, mutability,
	All faults that man may name, nay, that hell knows,
	Why, hers, in part, or all; but rather, all;
	For even to vice
	They are not constant, but are changing still
	One vice but of a minute old for one
	Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,
	Detest them, curse them. Yet 'tis greater skill
	In a true hate to pray they have their will:
	The very devils cannot plague them better.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 5><SCENE 1><75%>
	Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd
	Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,
	If each of you should take this course, how many
	Must murder wives much better than themselves
	For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!
	Every good servant does not all commands;
	No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you
	Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never
	Had liv'd to put on this; so had you sav'd
	The noble Imogen to repent, and struck
	Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack!
	You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,
	To have them fall no more; you some permit
	To second ills with ills, each elder worse,
	And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift.
	But Imogen is your own; do your best wills,
	And make me bless'd to obey. I am brought hither
	Among the Italian gentry, and to fight
	Against my lady's kingdom; 'tis enough
	That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress-piece!
	I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore good heavens,
	Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me
	Of these Italian weeds, and suit myself
	As does a Briton peasant; so I'll fight
	Against the part I come with, so I'll die
	For thee, O Imogen! even for whom my life
	Is, every breath, a death: and thus, unknown,
	Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril
	Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know
	More valour in me than my habits show.
	Gods! put the strength o' the Leonati in me.
	To shame the guise o' the world, I will begin
	The fashion, less without and more within.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 5><SCENE 3><77%>
	I did:
	Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 5><SCENE 3><77%>
	No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,
	But that the heavens fought. The king himself
	Of his wings destitute, the army broken,
	And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying
	Through a strait lane; the enemy full-hearted,
	Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work
	More plentiful than tools to do 't, struck down
	Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling
	Merely through fear; that the strait pass was damm'd
	With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living
	To die with lengthen'd shame.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 5><SCENE 3><77%>
	Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;
	Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,
	An honest one, I warrant; who deserv'd
	So long a breeding as his white beard came to,
	In doing this for his country; athwart the lane,
	He, with two striplings,—lads more like to run
	The country base than to commit such slaughter,—
	With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer
	Than those for preservation cas'd, or shame,
	Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,
	'Our Britain's harts die flying, not our men:
	To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand!
	Or we are Romans, and will give you that
	Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,
	But to look back in frown: stand, stand!' These three,
	Three thousand confident, in act as many,—
	For three performers are the file when all
	The rest do nothing,—with this word, 'Stand, stand!'
	Accommodated by the place, more charming
	With their own nobleness,—which could have turn'd
	A distaff to a lance,—gilded pale looks,
	Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some, turn'd coward
	But by example,—O! a sin of war,
	Damn'd in the first beginners,—'gan to look
	The way that they did, and to grin like lions
	Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began
	A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon,
	A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly
	Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,
	The strides they victors made. And now our cowards—
	Like fragments in hard voyages—became
	The life o' the need; having found the back door open
	Of the unguarded hearts, Heavens! how they wound;
	Some slain before; some dying; some their friends
	O'er-borne i' the former wave; ten, chas'd by one,
	Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty;
	Those that would die or ere resist are grown
	The mortal bugs o' the field.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 5><SCENE 3><78%>
	Nay, do not wonder at it; you are made
	Rather to wonder at the things you hear
	Than to work any. Will you rime upon 't,
	And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:
	'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,
	Preserv'd the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'
<SPEECH 58><ACT 5><SCENE 3><78%>
	'Lack! to what end?
	Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;
	For if he'll do, as he is made to do,
	I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.
	You have put me into rime.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 5><SCENE 3><79%>
	Still going?—This is a lord! O noble misery!
	To be i' the field, and ask, 'what news?' of me!
	To-day how many would have given their honours
	To have sav'd their carcases! took heel to do 't,
	And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,
	Could not find death where I did hear him groan,
	Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,
	'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,
	Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we
	That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find him;
	For being now a favourer to the Briton,
	No more a Briton, I have resum'd again
	The part I came in; fight I will no more,
	But yield me to the veriest hind that shall
	Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
	Here made by the Roman; great the answer be
	Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death;
	On either side I come to spend my breath,
	Which neither here I'll keep nor bear agen,
	But end it by some means for Imogen.

	Most welcome, bondage! for thou art a way,
	I think, to liberty. Yet am I better
	Than one that's sick o' the gout, since he had rather
	Groan so in perpetuity than be cur'd
	By the sure physician death; who is the key
	To unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'd
	More than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give me
	The penitent instrument to pick that bolt;
	Then, free for ever! Is 't enough I am sorry?
	So children temporal fathers do appease;
	Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?
	I cannot do it better than in gyves,
	Desir'd more than constrain'd; to satisfy,
	If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take
	No stricter render of me than my all.
	I know you are more clement than vile men,
	Who of their broken debtors take a third,
	A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
	On their abatement: that's not my desire;
	For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though
	'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it;
	'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;
	Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake:
	You rather mine, being yours; and so great powers,
	If you will take this audit, take this life,
	And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!
	I'll speak to thee in silence.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 5><SCENE 4><83%>
	</STAGE DIR> Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire, and begot
	A father to me; and thou hast created
	A mother and two brothers. But—O scorn!—
	Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:
	And so I am awake. Poor wretches, that depend
	On greatness' favour dream as I have done;
	Wake, and find nothing. But, alas! I swerve:
	Many dream not to find, neither deserve,
	And yet are steep'd in favours; so am I,
	That have this golden chance and know not why.
	What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!
	Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment
	Nobler than that it covers: let thy effects
	So follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,
	As good as promise.
	Whenas a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be lopped branches, which, being dead many years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock, and freshly grow, then shall Posthumus end his miseries, Britain be fortunate, and flourish in peace and plenty.
	'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen
	Tongue and brain not; either both or nothing;
	Or senseless speaking, or a speaking such
	As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,
	The action of my life is like it, which
