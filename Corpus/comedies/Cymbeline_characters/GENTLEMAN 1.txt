	His daughter, and the heir of 's kingdom, whom
	He purpos'd to his wife's sole son,—a widow
	That late he married,—hath referr'd herself
	Unto a poor but worthy gentleman. She's wedded;
	Her husband banish'd, she imprison'd: all
	Is outward sorrow, though I think the king
	Be touch'd at very heart.

	He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,
	That most desir'd the match; but not a courtier,
	Although they wear their faces to the bent
	Of the king's looks, hath a heart that is not
	Glad at the thing they scowl at.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
	Too bad for bad report; and he that hath her,—
	I mean that married her, alack! good man!
	And therefore banish'd—is a creature such
	As, to seek through the regions of the earth
	For one his like, there would be something failing
	In him that should compare. I do not think
	So fair an outward and such stuff within
	Endows a man but he.

	I do extend him, sir, within himself,
	Crush him together rather than unfold
	His measure duly.

	I cannot delve him to the root: his father
	Was called Sicilius, who did join his honour
	Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
	But had his titles by Tenantius whom
	He serv'd with glory and admir'd success,
	So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;
	And had, besides this gentleman in question,
	Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time
	Died with their swords in hand; for which their father—
	Then old and fond of issue—took such sorrow
	That he quit being, and his gentle lady,
	Big of this gentleman, our theme, deceas'd
	As he was born. The king, he takes the babe
	To his protection; calls him Posthumus Leonatus;
	Breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber,
	Puts to him all the learnings that his time
	Could make him the receiver of; which he took,
	As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,
	And in's spring became a harvest; liv'd in court,—
	Which rare it is to do—most prais'd, most lov'd;
	A sample to the youngest, to the more mature
	A glass that feated them, and to the graver
	A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,
	For whom he now is banish'd, her own price
	Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;
	By her election may be truly read
	What kind of man he is.

	His only child.
	He had twosons,—if this be worth your hearing,
	Mark it,—the eldest of them at three years old,
	I' the swathing clothes the other, from their nursery
	Were stol'n; and to this hour no guess in knowledge
	Which way they went.

	Some twenty years.

	Howsoe'er 'tis strange,
	Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,
	Yet is it true, sir.

	We must forbear. Here comes the gentleman,
	The queen, and princess.
