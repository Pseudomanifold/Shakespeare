	A goodly day not to keep house, with such
	Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate
	Instructs you how to adore the heavens, and bows you
	To a morning's holy office; the gates of monarchs
	Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through
	And keep their impious turbans on, without
	Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!
	We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardly
	As prouder livers do.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 3><41%>
	Now for our mountain sport. Up to yond hill;
	Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,
	When you above perceive me like a crow,
	That it is place which lessens and sets off;
	And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
	Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war;
	This service is not service, so being done,
	But being so allow'd; to apprehend thus
	Draws us a profit from all things we see,
	And often, to our comfort, shall we find
	The sharded beetle in a safer hold
	Than is the full wing'd eagle. O! this life
	Is nobler than attending for a check,
	Richer than doing nothing for a bribe,
	Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk;
	Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,
	Yet keeps his book uncross'd; no life to ours.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 3><42%>
	How you speak!
	Did you but know the city's usuries
	And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court,
	As hard to leave as keep, whose top to climb
	Is certain falling, or so slippery that
	The fear's as bad as falling; the toil of the war,
	A pain that only seems to seek out danger
	I' the name of fame and honour; which dies i' the search,
	And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph
	As record of fair act; nay, many times,
	Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,
	Must curtsy at the censure: O boys! this story
	The world may read in me; my body's mark'd
	With Roman swords, and my report was once
	First with the best of note; Cymbeline lov'd me,
	And when a soldier was the theme, my name
	Was not far off; then was I as a tree
	Whose boughs did bend with fruit, but, in one night,
	A storm or robbery, call it what you will,
	Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,
	And left me bare to weather.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 3><43%>
	My fault being nothing,—as I have told you oft,—
	But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd
	Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline
	I was confederate with the Romans; so
	Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years
	This rock and these demesnes have been my world,
	Where I have liv'd at honest freedom, paid
	More pious debts to heaven than in all
	The fore-end of my time. But, up to the mountains!
	This is not hunter's language. He that strikes
	The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast;
	To him the other two shall minister;
	And we will fear no poison which attends
	In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.
	How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!
	These boys know little they are sons to the king;
	Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.
	They think they are mine; and, though train'd up thus meanly
	I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit
	The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them
	In simple and low things to prince it much
	Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,
	The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who
	The king his father call'd Guiderius,—Jove!
	When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell
	The war-like feats I have done, his spirits fly out
	Into my story: say, 'Thus mine enemy fell,
	And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even then
	The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,
	Strains his young nerves, and puts himself in posture
	That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,—
	Once Arviragus,—in as like a figure,
	Strikes life into my speech and shows much more
	His own conceiving. Hark! the game is rous'd.
	O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows
	Thou didst unjustly banish me; whereon,
	At three and two years old, I stole these babes,
	Thinking to bar thee of succession, as
	Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,
	Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for their mother,
	And every day do honour to her grave:
	Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,
	They take for natural father. The game is up.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 6><56%>
	You, Polydore, have prov'd best woodman, and
	Are master of the feast; Cadwal and I
	Will play the cook and servant, 'tis our match;
	The sweat of industry would dry and die
	But for the end it works to. Come; our stomachs
	Will make what's homely savoury; weariness
	Can snore upon the flint when resty sloth
	Finds the down pillow hard. Now, peace be here,
	Poor house, that keep'st thyself!

	It is great morning. Come, away!—Who's there?
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 2><61%>
	'Those runagates!'
	Means he not us? I partly know him; 'tis
	Cloten, the son o' the queen. I fear some ambush.
	I saw him not these many years, and yet
	I know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws: hence!
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 2><62%>
	No companies abroad.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
	I cannot tell; long is it since I saw him,
	But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour
	Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice,
	And burst of speaking, were as his. I am absolute
	'Twas very Cloten.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
	Being scarce made up,
	I mean, to man, he had not apprehension
	Of roaring terrors; for defect of judgment
	Is oft the cease of fear. But see, thy brother.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
	What hast thou done?
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
	We are all undone.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
	No single soul
	Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason
	He must have some attendants. Though his humour
	Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that
	From one bad thing to worse; not frenzy, not
	Absolute madness could so far have rav'd
	To bring him here alone. Although, perhaps,
	It may be heard at court that such as we
	Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time
	May make some stronger head; the which he hearing,—
	As it is like him,—might break out, and swear
	He'd fetch us in; yet is 't not probable
	To come alone, either he so undertaking,
	Or they so suffering; then, on good ground we fear,
	If we do fear this body hath a tail
	More perilous than the head.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
	I had no mind
	To hunt this day; the boy Fidele's sickness
	Did make my way long forth.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
	I fear 'twill be reveng'd.
	Would, Polydore, thou hadst not done 't! though valour

<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
	Well, 'tis done.—
	We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger
	Where there's no profit. I prithee, to our rock;
	You and Fidele play the cooks; I'll stay
	Till hasty Polydore return, and bring him
	To dinner presently.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	O thou goddess!
	Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st
	In these two princely boys. They are as gentle
	As zephyrs, blowing below the violet,
	Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,
	Their royal blood enchaf'd, as the rud'st wind,
	That by the top doth take the mountain pine,
	And make him stoop to the vale. 'Tis wonder
	That an invisible instinct should frame them
	To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,
	Civility not seen from other, valour
	That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop
	As if it had been sow'd! Yet still it's strange
	What Cloten's being here to us portends,
	Or what his death will bring us.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	My ingenious instrument!
	Hark! Polydore, it sounds; but what occasion

	He went hence even now.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>

	Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.
	How found you him?
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	Great griefs, I see, medicine the less, for Cloten
	Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys,
	And though he came our enemy, remember
	He was paid for that; though mean and mighty rotting
	Together, have one dust, yet reverence—
	That angel of the world—doth make distinction
	Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely,
	And though you took his life, as being our foe,
	Yet bury him as a prince.

	Here's a few flowers, but 'bout mid-night, more;

	These herblets shall, which we upon you strew.
	Come on, away; apart upon our knees.

	Sons,

	To the king's party there's no going; newness

	Among the bands,—may drive us to a render
	Where we have liv'd, and so extort from 's that
	Which we have done, whose answer would be death
	Drawn on with torture.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 4><SCENE 4><74%>
	O! I am known
	Of many in the army; many years,
	Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him
	From my remembrance. And, besides, the king

	Who find in my exile the want of breeding,
	The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless
	To have the courtesy your cradle promis'd,
	But to be still hot summer's tanlings and
	The shrinking slaves of winter.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 4><SCENE 4><74%>
	No reason I, since of your lives you set

<SPEECH 52><ACT 5><SCENE 5><95%>
	Have at it, then, by leave.

<SPEECH 53><ACT 5><SCENE 5><95%>
	He it is that hath

	Not too hot:

<SPEECH 55><ACT 5><SCENE 5><95%>
	I am too blunt and saucy; here's my knee:
	Ere I arise I will prefer my sons;
	Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,
	These two young gentlemen, that call me father,
	And think they are my sons, are none of mine;
	They are the issue of your loins, my liege,
	And blood of your begetting.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 5><SCENE 5><96%>
	So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,
	Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:
	Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment
	Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd
	Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes—
	For such and so they are—these twenty years
	Have I train'd up; those arts they have as I
	Could put into them; my breeding was, sir, as
	Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,
	Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children
	Upon my banishment: I mov'd her to 't,
	Having receiv'd the punishment before,
	For that which I did then; beaten for loyalty
	Excited me to treason. Their dear loss,
	The more of you 'twas felt the more it shap'd
	Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,
	Here are your sons again; and I must lose
	Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.
	The benediction of these covering heavens
	Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy
	To inlay heaven with stars.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 5><SCENE 5><96%>
	Be pleas'd awhile.
	This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,
	Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius;
	This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,
	Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd
	In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand
	Of his queen mother, which, for more probation,
	I can with ease produce.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
	This is he,
	Who hath upon him still that natural stamp.
	It was wise nature's end in the donation,
	To be his evidence now.
