	Hail, heaven!
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 3><42%>
	What should we speak of
	When we are old as you? when we shall hear
	The rain and wind beat dark December, how
	In this our pinching cave shall we discourse
	The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;
	We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,
	Like war-like as the wolf for what we eat;
	Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage
	We make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,
	And sing our bondage freely.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 6><56%>
	I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 6><56%>
	All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!
	As 'tis no better reckon'd but of those
	Who worship dirty gods.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 6><57%>
	I'll make 't my comfort
	He is a man; I'll love him as my brother;
	And such a welcome as I'd give to him
	After a long absence, such is yours: most welcome!
	Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 6><57%>
	Or I, whate'er it be,
	What pain it cost, what danger. Gods!
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 6><58%>
	The night to the owl and morn to the lark less welcome.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 6><58%>
	I pray, draw near.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 2><59%>
	</STAGE DIR> Brother, stay here;
	Are we not brothers?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 2><60%>
	If it be sin to say so, sir, I yoke me
	In my good brother's fault: I know not why
	I love this youth; and I have heard you say,
	Love's reason's without reason: the bier at door,
	And a demand who is 't shall die, I'd say
	'My father, not this youth.'
<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 2><60%>
	Brother, farewell.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 2><60%>
	You health. So please you, sir.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 2><60%>
	Thus did he answer me; yet said hereafter
	I might know more.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 2><61%>
	We'll not be long away.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 2><61%>
	How angel-like he sings!
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 2><61%>
	Nobly he yokes
	A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
	Was that it was, for not being such a smile;
	The smile mocking the sigh, that it would fly
	From so divine a temple, to commix
	With winds that sailors rail at.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 2><61%>
	Grow, patience!
	And let the stinking-elder, grief, untwine
	His perishing root with the increasing vine!
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
	None in the world. You did mistake him, sure.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
	In this place we left them:
	I wish my brother make good time with him,
	You say he is so fell.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
	Let ordinance
	Come as the gods foresay it; howsoe'er,
	My brother hath done well.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
	Would I had done 't
	So the revenge alone pursu'd me! Polydore,
	I love thee brotherly, but envy much
	Thou hast robb'd me of this deed; I would revenges,
	That possible strength might meet, would seek us through
	And put us to our answer.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
	Poor sick Fidele!
	I'll willingly to him; to gain his colour
	I'd let a parish of such Clotens blood,
	And praise myself for charity.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	The bird is dead
	That we have made so much on. I had rather
	Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,
	To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch,
	Than have seen this.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Stark, as you see:
	Thus smiling, as some fly had tickled slumber,
	Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; his right cheek
	Reposing on a cushion.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	O' the floor,
	His arms thus leagu'd; I thought he slept, and put
	My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness
	Answer'd my steps too loud.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	With fairest flowers
	While summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,
	I'll sweeten thy sad grave; thou shalt not lack
	The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor
	The azur'd hare-bell, like thy veins, no, nor
	The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,
	Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,
	With charitable bill,—O bill! sore-shaming
	Those rich-left heirs, that let their fathers lie
	Without a monument,—bring thee all this;
	Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none,
	To winter-ground thy corse.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Say, where shall 's lay him?
<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	Be 't so:
	And let us, Polydore, though now our voices
	Have got the mannish crack, sing him to the ground,
	As once our mother; use like note and words,
	Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	We'll speak it then.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	If you'll go fetch him,
	We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	'Tis true.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	So, begin.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	Fear no more the frown o' the great,
	Thou art past the tyrant's stroke:
	Care no more to clothe and eat;
	To thee the reed is as the oak:
	The sceptre, learning, physic, must
	All follow this, and come to dust.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Thou hast finish'd joy and moan
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Nor no witchcraft charm thee!
<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Nothing ill come near thee!
<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 4><73%>
	What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it
	From action and adventure?
<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 4><74%>
	It is not likely
	That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,
	Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes
	And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,
	That they will waste their time upon our note,
	To know from whence we are.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 4><SCENE 4><74%>
	By this sun that shines,
	I'll thither: what thing is it that I never
	Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood
	But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!
	Never bestrid a horse, save one that had
	A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel
	Nor iron on his heel! I am asham'd
	To look upon the holy sun, to have
	The benefit of his bless'd beams, remaining
	So long a poor unknown.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 4><SCENE 4><74%>
	So say I; amen.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 5><SCENE 2><76%>
	Stand, stand, and fight!
<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 5><89%>
	One sand another
	Not more resembles;—that sweet rosy lad
	Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?
<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 5><95%>
	In that he spake too far.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 5><95%>
	Your danger's ours.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
	Ay, my good lord.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 5><SCENE 5><98%>
	You holp us, sir,
	As you did mean indeed to be our brother;
	Joy'd are we that you are.
