	O!
	Dissembling courtesy. How fine this tyrant
	Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,
	I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing,—
	Always reserv'd my holy duty,—what
	His rage can do on me. You must be gone;
	And I shall here abide the hourly shot

	That I may see again.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Nay, stay a little:

	Sir,

<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>

	Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far

	That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce

	Who? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus.

	Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,
	For it doth physic love,—of his content,
	All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Bless'd be
	You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers
	And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike;
	Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet
	You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!
	Justice, and your father's wrath, should he take me in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me, as you, O the dearest of creatures, would not even renew me with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria, at Milford-Haven; what your own love will out of this advise you, follow. So, he wishes you all happiness, that remains loyal to his vow, and your, increasing in love,
	<LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.>O! for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?
	He is at Milford-Haven; read, and tell me
	How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs
	May plod it in a week, why may not I
	Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,—
	Who long'st, like me, to see thy lord; who long'st,—
	O! let me 'bate,—but not like me; yet long'st,
	But in a fainter kind:—O! not like me,
	For mine's beyond beyond; say, and speak thick;—
	Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,
	To the smothering of the sense,—how far it is
	To this same blessed Milford; and, by the way,
	Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
	T' inherit such a haven; but, first of all,
	How we may steal from hence, and, for the gap
	That we shall make in time, from our hencegoing
	And our return, to excuse; but first, how get hence.
	Why should excuse be born or ere begot?
	We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,
	How many score of miles may we well ride
	'Twixt hour and hour?
<SPEECH 64><ACT 3><SCENE 2><41%>
	Why, one that rode to 's execution, man,
	Could never go so slow: I have heard of riding wagers,
	Where horses have been nimbler than the sands
	That run i' the clock's behalf. But this is foolery;
	Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say
	She'll home to her father; and provide me presently
	A riding-suit, no costlier than would fit
	A franklin's housewife.
<SPEECH 65><ACT 3><SCENE 2><41%>
	I see before me, man; nor here, nor here,

	Accessible is none but Milford way.
<SPEECH 66><ACT 3><SCENE 4><44%>
	Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place
	Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so

	Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,
	That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh
	From the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,
	Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd
	Beyond self-explication; put thyself
	Into a haviour of less fear, ere wildness
	Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?
	Why tender'st thou that paper to me with
	A look untender? If 't be summer news,
	Smile to 't before; if winterly, thou need'st
	But keep that count'nance still. My husband's hand!
	That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,
	And he's at some hard point. Speak, man; thy tongue
	May take off some extremity, which to read
	Would be even mortal to me.
<SPEECH 67><ACT 3><SCENE 4><45%>
	Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played the strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises, but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio, must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away her life; I shall give thee opportunity at Milford-Haven; she hath my letter for the purpose; where, if thou fear to strike, and to make me certain it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour and equally to me disloyal.
<SPEECH 68><ACT 3><SCENE 4><45%>
	False to his bed! What is it to be false?
	To lie in watch there and to think on him?

<SPEECH 69><ACT 3><SCENE 4><45%>
	I false! Thy conscience witness! Iachimo,
	Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;
	Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks
	Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy,
	Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:
	Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion,
	And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,
	I must be ripp'd; to pieces with me! O!
	Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,
	By thy revolt, O husband! shall be thought
	Put on for villany; not born where 't grows,
	But worn a bait for ladies.
<SPEECH 70><ACT 3><SCENE 4><46%>
	True honest men being heard, like false Æneas,
	Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping
	Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity
	From most true wretchedness; so thou, Posthumus,
	Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;
	Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjur'd
	From thy great fail. Come, fellow, be thou honest;
	Do thou thy master's bidding. When thou seest him,
	A little witness my obedience; look!
	I draw the sword myself; take it, and hit
	The innocent mansion of my love, my heart.
	Fear not, 'tis empty of all things but grief;
	Thy master is not there, who was indeed
	The riches of it: do his bidding; strike.
	Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause,
	But now thou seem'st a coward.
<SPEECH 71><ACT 3><SCENE 4><46%>
	Why, I must die;
	And if I do not by thy hand, thou art
	No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter
	There is a prohibition so divine
	That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.
	Something's afore 't; soft, soft! we'll no defence;
	Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?
	The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus
	All turn'd to heresy! Away, away!
	Corrupters of my faith; you shall no more
	Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools
	Believe false teachers; though those that are betray'd
	Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor
	Stands in worse case of woe.
	And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up
	My disobedience 'gainst the king my father,
	And make me put into contempt the suits
	Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find
	It is no act of common passage, but
	A strain of rareness; and I grieve myself
	To think, when thou shalt be disedg'd by her
	That now thou tir'st on, how thy memory
	Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch;
	The lamb entreats the butcher; where's thy knife?
	Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,
	When I desire it too.

	For my being absent?—whereunto I never

	When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,
	Thou wast within a ken. O Jove! I think
	Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,
	Where they should be reliev'd. Two beggars told me
	I could not miss my way; will poor folks lie,
	That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis
	A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,
	When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness
	Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood
	Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!
	Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,
	My hunger's gone, but even before I was
	At point to sink for food. But what is this?
	Here is a path to 't; 'tis some savage hold;
	I were best not call, I dare not call, yet famine,
	Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant.
	Plenty and peace breeds cowards, hardness ever
	Of hardiness is mother. Ho! Who's here?
	If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage,
	Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.
	Best draw my sword; and if mine enemy
	But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on 't.
	Such a foe, good heavens!
<SPEECH 85><ACT 3><SCENE 6><56%>
	Good masters, harm me not:
	Before I enter'd here, I call'd; and thought
	To have begg'd or bought what I have took. Good troth,
	I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had found
	Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat;
	I would have left it on the board so soon
	As I had made my meal, and parted
	With prayers for the provider.
<SPEECH 86><ACT 3><SCENE 6><56%>
	I see you're angry.
	Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should
	Have died had I not made it.

	To Milford-Haven.
<SPEECH 88><ACT 3><SCENE 6><57%>
	Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who
	Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford:
	To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,
	I am fall'n in this offence.
<SPEECH 89><ACT 3><SCENE 6><57%>
	'Mongst friends,
	If brothers. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Would it had been so, that they

	Been less, and so more equal ballasting
	To thee, Posthumus.
<SPEECH 90><ACT 3><SCENE 6><57%>
	Great men,
	That had a court no bigger than this cave,
	That did attend themselves and had the virtue
	Which their own conscience seal'd them,—laying by
	That nothing-gift of differing multitudes,—
	Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!
	I'd change my sex to be companion with them,
	Since Leonatus' false.
<SPEECH 91><ACT 3><SCENE 6><58%>
	Thanks, sir.
<SPEECH 92><ACT 4><SCENE 2><59%>
	So man and man should be,
	But clay and clay differs in dignity,
	Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.
<SPEECH 93><ACT 4><SCENE 2><59%>
	So sick I am not, yet I am not well;
	But not so citizen a wanton as
	To seem to die ere sick. So please you, leave me;
	Stick to your journal course; the breach of custom
	Is breach of all. I am ill; but your being by me
	Cannot amend me; society is no comfort
	To one not sociable. I am not very sick,
	Since I can reason of it; pray you, trust me here,
	I'll rob none but myself, and let me die,
	Stealing so poorly.
<SPEECH 94><ACT 4><SCENE 2><60%>
	I wish ye sport.
<SPEECH 95><ACT 4><SCENE 2><60%>
	</STAGE DIR> These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies I have heard!
	Our courtiers say all's savage but at court:
	Experience, O! thou disprov'st report.
	The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dish
	Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.
	I am sick still, heart-sick. Pisanio,
	I'll now taste of thy drug.
<SPEECH 96><ACT 4><SCENE 2><61%>
	Well or ill,
	I am bound to you.
<SPEECH 97><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	</STAGE DIR> Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven; which is the way?
	I thank you. By yond bush? Pray, how far thither?
	'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?
	I have gone all night: Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.
	</STAGE DIR> But, soft! no bed-fellow! O gods and goddesses!
	These flowers are like the pleasures of the world;
	This bloody man, the care on 't. I hope I dream;
	For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,
	And cook to honest creatures; but 'tis not so,
	'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,
	Which the brain makes of fumes. Our very eyes
	Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,
	I tremble still with fear; but if there be
	Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
	As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!
	The dream's here still; even when I wake, it is
	Without me, as within me; not imagin'd, felt.
	A headless man! The garments of Posthumus!
	I know the shape of 's leg, this is his hand,
	His foot Mercurial, his Martial thigh,
	The brawns of Hercules, but his Jovial face—
	Murder in heaven? How! 'Tis gone. Pisanio,
	All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,
	And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,
	Conspir'd with that irregulous devil, Cloten,
	Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read
	Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio
	Hath with his forged letters, damn'd Pisanio,
	From this most bravest vessel of the world
	Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas!
	Where is thy head? where's that? Ay me! where's that?
	Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,
	And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?
	'Tis he and Cloten; malice and lucre in them
	Have laid this woe here. O! 'tis pregnant, pregnant!
	The drug he gave me, which he said was precious
	And cordial to me, have I not found it
	Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home;
	This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O!
	Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,
	That we the horrider may seem to those
	Which chance to find us. O! my lord, my lord.
<SPEECH 98><ACT 4><SCENE 2><70%>
	I am nothing; or if not,
	Nothing to be were better. This was my master,
	A very valiant Briton and a good,
	That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!
	There are no more such masters; I may wander
	From east to occident, cry out for service,
	Try many, all good, serve truly, never
	Find such another master.

<SPEECH 100><ACT 4><SCENE 2><71%>
	Fidele, sir.
<SPEECH 101><ACT 4><SCENE 2><71%>
	I'll follow, sir. But first, an 't please the gods,
	I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep
	As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when
	With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave,
	And on it said a century of prayers,
	Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;
	And, leaving so his service, follow you,
	So please you entertain me.
<SPEECH 102><ACT 5><SCENE 5><89%>
	I humbly thank your highness.
<SPEECH 103><ACT 5><SCENE 5><89%>
	No, no; alack!

	I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please

	When ye were so indeed.
<SPEECH 117><ACT 5><SCENE 5><98%>
	You are my father too; and did relieve me,
