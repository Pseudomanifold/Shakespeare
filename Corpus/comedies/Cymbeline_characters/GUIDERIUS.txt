	Hail, heaven!
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 3><42%>
	Out of your proof you speak; we, poor unfledg'd,
	Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not
	What air's from home. Haply this life is best,
	If quiet life be best; sweeter to you
	That have a sharper known, well corresponding
	With your stiff age; but unto us it is
	A cell of ignorance, travelling a-bed,
	A prison for a debtor, that not dares
	To stride a limit.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 3><43%>
	Uncertain favour!
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 6><56%>
	I am throughly weary.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 6><56%>
	There is cold meat i' the cave; we'll browse on that,
	Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 6><56%>
	What's the matter, sir?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 6><56%>
	Money, youth?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 6><57%>
	Were you a woman, youth,
	I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty,
	I bid for you, as I do buy.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 6><57%>
	Would I could free 't!
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 6><58%>
	Pray, draw near.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 2><59%>
	Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 2><60%>
	I love thee; I have spoke it;
	How much the quantity, the weight as much,
	As I do love my father.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 2><60%>
	I could not stir him;
	He said he was gentle, but unfortunate;
	Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 2><61%>
	But his neat cookery! he cut our roots
	In characters,
	And sauc'd our broths as Juno had been sick
	And he her dieter.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 2><61%>
	I do note
	That grief and patience rooted in him, both
	Mingle their spurs together.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 2><61%>
	He is but one. You and my brother search
	What companies are near; pray you, away;
	Let me alone with him.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 2><62%>
	A thing
	More slavish did I ne'er than answering
	A 'slave' without a knock.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 2><62%>
	To who? to thee? What art thou? Have not I
	An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?
	Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not
	My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,
	Why I should yield to thee?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 2><62%>
	No, nor thy tailor, rascal,
	Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,
	Which, as it seems, make thee.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 2><62%>
	Hence then, and thank
	The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;
	I am loath to beat thee.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 2><62%>
	What's thy name?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 2><62%>
	Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,
	I cannot tremble at it; were it Toad, or Adder, Spider,
	'Twould move me sooner.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 2><62%>
	I'm sorry for 't, not seeming
	So worthy as thy birth.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 2><62%>
	Those that I reverence those I fear, the wise;
	At fools I laugh, not fear them.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
	This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse,
	There was no money in 't. Not Hercules
	Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none;
	Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
	My head as I do his.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
	I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,
	Son to the queen, after his own report;
	Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore,
	With his own single hand he'd take us in,
	Displace our heads where—thank the gods!—they grow,
	And set them on Lud's town.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
	Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,
	But that he swore to take, our lives? The law
	Protects not us; then why should we be tender
	To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,
	Play judge and executioner all himself,
	For we do fear the law? What company
	Discover you abroad?
<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
	With his own sword,
	Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en
	His head from him; I'll throw 't into the creek
	Behind our rock, and let it to the sea,
	And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:
	That's all I reck.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	Where's my brother?
	I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,
	In embassy to his mother; his body's hostage
	For his return.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	Is he at home?
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	What does he mean? since death of my dear'st mother
	It did not speak before. All solemn things
	Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?
	Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
	Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
	Is Cadwal mad?
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	O, sweetest, fairest lily!
	My brother wears thee not the one half so well
	As when thou grew'st thyself.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Where?
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Why, he but sleeps:
	If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed;
	With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,
	And worms will not come to thee.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Prithee, have done,
	And do not play in wench-like words with that
	Which is so serious. Let us bury him,
	And not protract with admiration what
	Is now due debt. To the grave!
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	By good Euriphile, our mother.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	Cadwal,
	I cannot sing; I'll weep, and word it with thee;
	For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
	Than priests and fanes that lie.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	Pray you, fetch him hither.
	Thersites' body is as good as Ajax'
	When neither are alive.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the east;
	My father hath a reason for 't.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	Come on then, and remove him.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	Fear no more the heat o' the sun,
	Nor the furious winter's rages;
	Thou thy worldly task hast done,
	Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages;
	Golden lads and girls all must,
	As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Fear no more the lightning-flash,
<SPEECH 43><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Fear not slander, censure rash;
<SPEECH 44><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	No exorciser harm thee!
<SPEECH 45><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Ghost unlaid forbear thee!
<SPEECH 46><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	We have done our obsequies. Come, lay him down.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 4><SCENE 4><73%>
	The noise is round about us.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 4><SCENE 4><73%>
	Nay, what hope
	Have we in hiding us? this way, the Romans
	Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us
	For barbarous and unnatural revolts
	During their use, and slay us after.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 4><SCENE 4><73%>
	This is, sir, a doubt
	In such a time nothing becoming you,
	Nor satisfying us.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 4><SCENE 4><74%>
	Than be so
	Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army:
	I and my brother are not known; yourself,
	So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,
	Cannot be question'd.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 4><SCENE 4><74%>
	By heavens! I'll go:
	If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,
	I'll take the better care; but if you will not,
	The hazard therefore due fall on me by
	The hands of Romans.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 5><SCENE 2><76%>
	Stand, stand, and fight!
<SPEECH 53><ACT 5><SCENE 5><89%>
	The same dead thing alive.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 5><SCENE 5><89%>
	But we saw him dead.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 5><SCENE 5><93%>
	This is, sure, Fidele.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 5><SCENE 5><94%>
	Let me end the story:
	I slew him there.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 5><SCENE 5><94%>
	I have spoke it, and I did it.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 5><SCENE 5><94%>
	A most incivil one. The wrongs he did me
	Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me
	With language that would make me spurn the sea
	If it could so roar to me. I cut off 's head;
	And am right glad he is not standing here
	To tell this tale of mine.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 5><SCENE 5><95%>
	And our good his.
<SPEECH 60><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
	And at first meeting lov'd;
	Continu'd so, until we thought he died.
