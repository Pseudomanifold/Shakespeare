	Last night the very gods show'd me a vision,—
	I fast and pray'd for their intelligence,—thus:
	I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd
	From the spongy south to this part of the west,
	There vanish'd in the sunbeams; which portends,
	Unless my sins abuse my divination,
	Success to the Roman host.

	Here, my good lord.

	Whenas a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be lopped branches, which, being dead many years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock, and freshly grow: then shall Posthumus end his miseries, Britain be fortunate, and flourish in peace and plenty.
	Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;
	The fit and apt construction of thy name,
	Being Leo-natus, doth import so much.
	</STAGE DIR> The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,
	Which we call mollis aer; and mollis aer
	We term it mulier; which mulier, I divine,
	Is this most constant wife; who, even now,
	Answering the letter of the oracle,
	Unknown to you, <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> unsought, were clipp'd about
	With this most tender air.

	The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,
	Personates thee, and thy lopp'd branches point
	Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stolen,
	For many years thought dead, are now reviv'd
	To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue
	Promises Britain peace and plenty.

	The fingers of the powers above do tune
	The harmony of this peace. The vision
	Which I made known to Lucius ere the stroke
	Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant
	Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,
	From south to west on wing soaring aloft,
	Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sun
	So vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,
	The imperial Cæsar, should again unite
	His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,
	Which shines here in the west.
