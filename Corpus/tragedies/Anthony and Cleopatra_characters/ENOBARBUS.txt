	Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
	Cleopatra's health to drink.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><4%>
	Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall be,—drunk to bed.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><5%>
	Hush! here comes Antony.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><5%>
	No, lady.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><5%>
	Madam!
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><6%>
	What's your pleasure, sir?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 2><6%>
	Why, then, we kill all our women. We see how mortal an unkindness is to them; if they suffer our departure, death's the word.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	Under a compelling occasion let women die; it were pity to cast them away for nothing; though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle in death which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	Alack! sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a shower of rain as well as Jove.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	O, sir! you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blessed withal would have discredited your travel.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	Sir?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	Fulvia!
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their de ties to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein, that when old robes are worn out, there are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new petticoat; and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	And the business you have broached here cannot be without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which wholly depends on your abode.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	I shall do it.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 2><18%>
	I shall entreat him
	To answer like himself: if Cæsar move him,
	Let Antony look over Cæsar's head,
	And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
	Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,
	I would not shave 't to-day.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 2><19%>
	Every time
	Serves for the matter that is then born in 't.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 2><19%>
	Not if the small come first.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 2><19%>
	And yonder, Cæsar.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 2><20%>
	Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to wars with the women!
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 2><21%>
	Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant, you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 2><22%>
	That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 2><22%>
	Go to, then; your considerate stone.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 2><23%>
	Half the heart of Cæsar, worthy Mecænas! My honourable friend, Agrippa!
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
	Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, and made the night light with drinking.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
	This was but as a fly by an eagle; we had much more monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
	When she first met Mark Antony she pursed up his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
	I will tell you.
	The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
	Burn'd on the water; the poop was beaten gold,
	Purple the sails, and so perfumed, that
	The winds were love-sick with them, the oars were silver,
	Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
	The water which they beat to follow faster,
	As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
	It beggar'd all description; she did lie
	In her pavilion,—cloth-of-gold of tissue,—
	O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
	The fancy outwork nature; on each side her
	Stood pretty-dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
	With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
	To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
	And what they undid did.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
	Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
	So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,
	And made their bends adornings; at the helm
	A seeming mermaid steers; the silken tackle
	Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,
	That yarely frame the office. From the barge
	A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
	Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
	Her people out upon her, and Antony,
	Enthron'd i' the market-place, did sit alone,
	Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,
	Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too
	And made a gap in nature.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
	Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
	Invited her to supper; she replied
	It should be better he became her guest,
	Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,
	Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
	Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
	And, for his ordinary pays his heart
	For what his eyes eat only.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
	I saw her once
	Hop forty paces through the public street;
	And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted
	That she did make defect perfection,
	And, breathless, power breathe forth.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
	Never; he will not:
	Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
	Her infinite variety; other women cloy
	The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry
	Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
	Become themselves in her, that the holy priests
	Bless her when she is riggish.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	Humbly, sir, I thank you.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
	No more of that: he did so.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
	A certain queen to Cæsar in a mattress.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
	Well;
	And well am like to do; for I perceive
	Four feasts are toward.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
	Sir,
	I never lov'd you much, but I ha' prais'd ye
	When you have well deserv'd ten times as much
	As I have said you did.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
	At sea, I think.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
	You have done well by water.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
	I will praise any man that will praise me; though it cannot be denied what I have done by land.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	Yes, something you can deny for your own safety; you have been a great thief by sea.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	There I deny my land service. But give me your hand, Menas; if our eyes had authority, here they might take two thieves kissing.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	We came hither to fight with you.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	If he do, sure, he cannot weep it back again.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	Cæsar's sister is called Octavia.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	'Tis true.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	I think so too; but you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity. Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again; then, shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Cæsar, and, as I said before, that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is; he married but his occasion here.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 2><SCENE 6><36%>
	I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 2><SCENE 7><37%>
	Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 2><SCENE 7><39%>
	Here's to thee, Menas!
<SPEECH 55><ACT 2><SCENE 7><39%>
	There's a strong fellow, Menas.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 2><SCENE 7><39%>
	A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'st not?
<SPEECH 57><ACT 2><SCENE 7><39%>
	Drink thou; increase the reels.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 2><SCENE 7><39%>
	</STAGE DIR> Ha! my brave emperor;
	Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,
	And celebrate our drink?
<SPEECH 59><ACT 2><SCENE 7><39%>
	All take hands.
	Make battery to our ears with the loud music;
	The while I'll place you; then the boy shall sing,
	The holding every man shall bear as loud
	As his strong sides can volley.
	Come, thou monarch of the vine,
	Plumpy Bacchus, with pink eyne!
	In thy fats our cares be drown'd,
	With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:
	Cup us, till the world go round,
	Cup us, till the world go round!
<SPEECH 60><ACT 2><SCENE 7><40%>
	Take heed you fall not.
	Menas, I'll not on shore.
<SPEECH 61><ACT 2><SCENE 7><40%>
	Hoo! says a'. There's my cap.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 3><SCENE 2><42%>
	They have dispatch'd with Pompey; he is gone;
	The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
	To part from Rome; Cæsar is sad; and Lepidus,
	Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
	With the green sickness.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 3><SCENE 2><42%>
	A very fine one. O! how he loves Cæsar.
<SPEECH 64><ACT 3><SCENE 2><42%>
	Cæsar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.
<SPEECH 65><ACT 3><SCENE 2><42%>
	Spake you of Cæsar? How! the non-pareil!
<SPEECH 66><ACT 3><SCENE 2><42%>
	Would you praise Cæsar, say, 'Cæsar,' go no further.
<SPEECH 67><ACT 3><SCENE 2><42%>
	But he loves Cæsar best; yet he loves Antony.
	Hoo! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot
	Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number; hoo!
	His love to Antony. But as for Cæsar,
	Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.
<SPEECH 68><ACT 3><SCENE 2><42%>
	They are his shards, and he their beetle.
	</STAGE DIR> So;
	This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.
<SPEECH 69><ACT 3><SCENE 2><43%>
	</STAGE DIR> Will Cæsar weep?
<SPEECH 70><ACT 3><SCENE 2><43%>
	He were the worse for that were he a horse;
	So is he, being a man.
<SPEECH 71><ACT 3><SCENE 2><43%>
	That year, indeed, he was troubled with a rheum;
	What willingly he did confound he wail'd,
	Believe 't, till I wept too.
<SPEECH 72><ACT 3><SCENE 5><47%>
	How now, friend Eros!
<SPEECH 73><ACT 3><SCENE 5><47%>
	What, man?
<SPEECH 74><ACT 3><SCENE 5><47%>
	This is old: what is the success?
<SPEECH 75><ACT 3><SCENE 5><47%>
	Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more;
	And throw between them all the food thou hast,
	They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?
<SPEECH 76><ACT 3><SCENE 5><47%>
	Our great navy's rigg'd.
<SPEECH 77><ACT 3><SCENE 5><47%>
	'Twill be naught;
	But let it be. Bring me to Antony.
<SPEECH 78><ACT 3><SCENE 7><51%>
	But why, why, why?
<SPEECH 79><ACT 3><SCENE 7><51%>
	Well, is it, is it?
<SPEECH 80><ACT 3><SCENE 7><51%>
	</STAGE DIR> Well, I could reply:
	If we should serve with horse and mares together,
	The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear
	A soldier and his horse.
<SPEECH 81><ACT 3><SCENE 7><51%>
	Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
	Take from his heart, take from his brain, from 's time,
	What should not then be spar'd. He is already
	Traduc'd for levity, and 'tis said in Rome
	That Photinus a eunuch and your maids
	Manage this war.
<SPEECH 82><ACT 3><SCENE 7><51%>
	Nay, I have done.
	Here comes the emperor.
<SPEECH 83><ACT 3><SCENE 7><52%>
	So hath my lord dar'd him to single fight.
<SPEECH 84><ACT 3><SCENE 7><52%>
	Your ships are not well mann'd;
	Your mariners are muleters, reapers, people
	Ingross'd by swift impress; in Cæsar's fleet
	Are those that often have gainst Pompey fought:
	Their ships are yare; yours, heavy. No disgrace
	Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
	Being prepar'd for land.
<SPEECH 85><ACT 3><SCENE 7><52%>
	Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
	The absolute soldiership you have by land;
	Distract your army, which doth most consist
	Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted
	Your own renowned knowledge; quite forego
	The way which promises assurance; and
	Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard
	From firm security.
<SPEECH 86><ACT 3><SCENE 8><54%>
	Naught, naught, all naught! I can behold no longer.
	The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,
	With all their sixty, fly, and turn the rudder;
	To see 't mine eyes are blasted.
<SPEECH 87><ACT 3><SCENE 8><54%>
	What's thy passion?
<SPEECH 88><ACT 3><SCENE 8><54%>
	How appears the fight?
<SPEECH 89><ACT 3><SCENE 8><54%>
	That I beheld:
	Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not

<SPEECH 90><ACT 3><SCENE 8><55%>
	Alack, alack!
<SPEECH 91><ACT 3><SCENE 8><55%>
	Ay, are you thereabouts?
	Why, then, good night, indeed.
<SPEECH 92><ACT 3><SCENE 8><55%>
	I'll yet follow

<SPEECH 93><ACT 3><SCENE XI.— ><59%>
	Think, and die.
<SPEECH 94><ACT 3><SCENE XI.— ><59%>
	Antony only, that would make his will
	Lord of his reason. What though you fled
	From that great face of war, whose several ranges
	Frighted each other, why should he follow?
	The itch of his affection should not then
	Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,
	When half to half the world oppos'd, he being
	The mered question. 'Twas a shame no less
	Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,
	And leave his navy gazing.
<SPEECH 95><ACT 3><SCENE XI.— ><59%>
	</STAGE DIR> Yes, like enough, high-battled Cæsar will
	Unstate his happiness, and be stag'd to the show
	Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are
	A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
	Do draw the inward quality after them,
	To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
	Knowing all measures, the full Cæsar will
	Answer his emptiness! Cæsar, thou hast subdu'd
	His judgment too.
<SPEECH 96><ACT 3><SCENE XI.— ><60%>
	</STAGE DIR> Mine honesty and I begin to square.
	The loyalty well held to fools does make
	Our faith mere folly; yet he that can endure
	To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord,
	Does conquer him that did his master conquer,
	And earns a place i' the story.
<SPEECH 97><ACT 3><SCENE XI.— ><60%>
	He needs as many, sir, as Cæsar has,
	Or needs not us. If Cæsar please, our master
	Will leap to be his friend; for us, you know
	Whose he is we are, and that is Cæsar's.
<SPEECH 98><ACT 3><SCENE XI.— ><61%>
	</STAGE DIR> To be sure of that,
	I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou'rt so leaky,
	That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for
	Thy dearest quit thee.
<SPEECH 99><ACT 3><SCENE XI.— ><61%>
	</STAGE DIR> You will be whipp'd.
<SPEECH 100><ACT 3><SCENE XI.— ><62%>
	</STAGE DIR> 'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp
	Than with an old one dying.
<SPEECH 101><ACT 3><SCENE XI.— ><65%>
	Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious
	Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood
	The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,
	A diminution in our captain's brain
	Restores his heart. When valour preys on reason
	It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
	Some way to leave him.
<SPEECH 102><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	No.
<SPEECH 103><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
	He is twenty men to one.
<SPEECH 104><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	I'll strike, and cry, 'Take all.'
<SPEECH 105><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	</STAGE DIR> 'Tis one of those odd tricks which sorrow shoots
	Out of the mind.
<SPEECH 106><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	</STAGE DIR> To make his followers weep.
<SPEECH 107><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	What mean you, sir,

<SPEECH 108><ACT 4><SCENE 6><71%>
	Alexas did revolt, and went to Jewry on
	Affairs of Antony; there did persuade
	Great Herod to incline himself to Cæsar,
	And leave his master Antony: for this pains
	Cæsar hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest
	That fell away have entertainment, but
	No honourable trust. I have done ill,
	Of which I do accuse myself so sorely
	That I will joy no more.
<SPEECH 109><ACT 4><SCENE 6><71%>
	I give it you.
<SPEECH 110><ACT 4><SCENE 6><72%>
	I am alone the villain of the earth,
	And feel I am so most. O Antony!
	Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
	My better service, when my turpitude
	Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart:
	If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
	Shall outstrike thought; but thought will do 't, I feel.
	I fight against thee! No: I will go seek
	Some ditch, wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
	My latter part of life.
<SPEECH 111><ACT 4><SCENE 1><74%>
	O! bear me witness, night,—

	O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
	The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
	That life, a very rebel to my will,
	May hang no longer on me; throw my heart
	Against the flint and hardness of my fault,
	Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,
	And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony!
	Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
	Forgive me in thine own particular;
	But let the world rank me in register
	A master-leaver and a fugitive.
	O Antony! O Antony!
