	Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now
	Pleas'd fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
	Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body
	Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
	Pays this for Marcus Crassus.

	O Silius, Silius!
	I have done enough; a lower place, note well,
	May make too great an act; for learn this, Silius,
	Better to leave undone than by our deed
	Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
	CÃ¦sar and Antony have ever won
	More in their officer than person; Sossius,
	One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
	For quick accumulation of renown,
	Which he achiev'd by the minute, lost his favour.
	Who does i' the wars more than his captain can
	Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition,
	The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss
	Than gain which darkens him.
	I could do more to do Antonius good,
	But 'twould offend him; and in his offence
	Should my performance perish.

	I'll humbly signify what in his name,
	That magical word of war, we have effected;
	How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
	The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
	We have jaded out o' the field.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	He purposeth to Athens; whither, with what haste
	The weight we must convey with 's will permit,
	We shall appear before him. On, there; pass along.
