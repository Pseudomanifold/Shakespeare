	The greater cantle of the world is lost

	On our side like the token'd pestilence,
	Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,
	Whom leprosy o'ertake! i' the midst o' the fight,
	When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,
	Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,
	The breese upon her, like a cow in June,
	Hoists sails and flies.

	She once being loof'd,
	The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
	Clapson his sea-wing, and like a doting mallard,
	Leaving the fight in height, flies after her.
	I never saw an action of such shame;
	Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before
	Did violate so itself.

	O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed!
	Had we done so at first, we had droven them home

	Let us score their backs,

	Swallows have built
	In Cleopatra's sails their nests; the augurers
	Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,
	And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
	Is valiant, and dejected; and, by starts,
	His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear
	Of what he has and has not.
