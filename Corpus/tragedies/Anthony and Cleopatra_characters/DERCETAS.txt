	Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.
	This sword but shown to Cæsar, with this tidings,
	Shall enter me with him.

	There, Diomed, there.

	I am call'd Dercetas;
	Mark Antony I serv'd, who best was worthy
	Best to be serv'd; whilst he stood up and spoke
	He was my master, and I wore my life
	To spend upon his haters. If thou please
	To take me to thee, as I was to him
	I'll be to Cæsar; if thou pleasest not,
	I yield thee up my life.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	I say, O Cæsar, Antony is dead.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	He is dead, Cæsar;
	Not by a public minister of justice,
	Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,
	Which writ his honour in the acts it did,
	Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
	Splitted the heart. This is his sword;
	I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd
	With his most noble blood.
