	O'erflows the measure; those his goodly eyes,
	That o'er the files and musters of the war

	Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
	The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,

	The triple pillar of the world transform'd
	Into a strumpet's fool; behold and see.

	He comes too short of that great property
	Which still should go with Antony.
