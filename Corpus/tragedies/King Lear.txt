<ACT 1>


<SCENE 1>
<A Room of State in King Lear's Palace.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Kent, Gloucester, and Edmund.>
</STAGE DIR>
<KENT>	<0%>
	I thought the king had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.
</KENT>

<GLOUCESTER>	<0%>
	It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the dukes he values most; for equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either's moiety.
</GLOUCESTER>

<KENT>	<0%>
	Is not this your son, my lord?
</KENT>

<GLOUCESTER>	<1%>
	His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am brazed to it.
</GLOUCESTER>

<KENT>	<1%>
	I cannot conceive you.
</KENT>

<GLOUCESTER>	<1%>
	Sir, this young fellow's mother could; whereupon she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?
</GLOUCESTER>

<KENT>	<1%>
	I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.
</KENT>

<GLOUCESTER>	<1%>
	But I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account: though this knave came somewhat saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair; there was good sport at his making, and the whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund?
</GLOUCESTER>

<EDMUND>	<1%>
	No, my lord.
</EDMUND>

<GLOUCESTER>	<1%>
	My Lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my honourable friend.
</GLOUCESTER>

<EDMUND>	<1%>
	My services to your lordship.
</EDMUND>

<KENT>	<1%>
	I must love you, and sue to know you better.
</KENT>

<EDMUND>	<1%>
	Sir, I shall study deserving.
</EDMUND>

<GLOUCESTER>	<1%>
	He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again. The king is coming.

</GLOUCESTER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Sennet. Enter Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, and Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LEAR>	<1%>
	Attend the Lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.
</LEAR>

<GLOUCESTER>	<1%>
	I shall, my liege.
</GLOUCESTER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Gloucester and Edmund.>
</STAGE DIR>

<LEAR>	<1%>
	Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
	Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
	In three our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intent
	To shake all cares and business from our age,
	Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
	Unburden'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
	And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
	We have this hour a constant will to publish
	Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
	May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
	Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
	Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
	And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,—
	Since now we will divest us both of rule,
	Interest of territory, cares of state,—
	Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
	That we our largest bounty may extend
	Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
	Our eldest-born, speak first.
</LEAR>

<GONERIL>	<2%>
	Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;
	Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;
	Beyond what can be valu'd, rich or rare;
	No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
	As much as child e'er lov'd, or father found;
	A love that makes breath poor and speech unable;
	Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
</GONERIL>

<CORDELIA>	<2%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> What shall Cordelia do? Love, and be silent.
</CORDELIA>

<LEAR>	<2%>
	Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
	With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
	With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
	We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue
	Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,
	Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.
</LEAR>

<REGAN>	<2%>
	I am made of that self metal as my sister,
	And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
	I find she names my very deed of love;
	Only she comes too short: that I profess
	Myself an enemy to all other joys
	Which the most precious square of sense possesses
	And find I am alone felicitate
	In your dear highness' love.
</REGAN>

<CORDELIA>	<3%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Then, poor Cordelia!
	And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's
	More richer than my tongue.
</CORDELIA>

<LEAR>	<3%>
	To thee and thine, hereditary ever,
	Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,
	No less in space, validity, and pleasure,
	Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,
	Although our last, not least; to whose young love
	The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
	Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
	A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
</LEAR>

<CORDELIA>	<3%>
	Nothing, my lord.
</CORDELIA>

<LEAR>	<3%>
	Nothing?
</LEAR>

<CORDELIA>	<3%>
	Nothing.
</CORDELIA>

<LEAR>	<3%>
	Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.
</LEAR>

<CORDELIA>	<3%>
	Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
	My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
	According to my bond; nor more nor less.
</CORDELIA>

<LEAR>	<3%>
	How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,
	Lest you may mar your fortunes.
</LEAR>

<CORDELIA>	<3%>
	Good my lord,
	You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me: I
	Return those duties back as are right fit,
	Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
	Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
	They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
	That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
	Half my love with him, half my care and duty:
	Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,
	To love my father all.
</CORDELIA>

<LEAR>	<3%>
	But goes thy heart with this?
</LEAR>

<CORDELIA>	<3%>
	Ay, good my lord.
</CORDELIA>

<LEAR>	<3%>
	So young, and so untender?
</LEAR>

<CORDELIA>	<3%>
	So young, my lord, and true.
</CORDELIA>

<LEAR>	<3%>
	Let it be so; thy truth then be thy dower:
	For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
	The mysteries of Hecate and the night,
	By all the operation of the orbs
	From whom we do exist and cease to be,
	Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
	Propinquity and property of blood,
	And as a stranger to my heart and me
	Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
	Or he that makes his generation messes
	To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
	Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd,
	As thou my sometime daughter.
</LEAR>

<KENT>	<4%>
	Good my liege,—
</KENT>

<LEAR>	<4%>
	Peace, Kent!
	Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
	I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest
	On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!
	So be my grave my peace, as here I give
	Her father's heart from her! Call France. Who stirs?
	Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,
	With my two daughters' dowers digest the third;
	Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
	I do invest you jointly with my power,
	Pre-eminence, and all the large effects
	That troop with majesty. Ourself by monthly course,
	With reservation of a hundred knights,
	By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
	Make with you by due turn. Only we shall retain
	The name and all th' addition to a king;
	The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
	Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,
	This coronet part between you.
</LEAR>

<KENT>	<4%>
	Royal Lear,
	Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
	Lov'd as my father, as my master follow'd,
	As my great patron thought on in my prayers,—
</KENT>

<LEAR>	<4%>
	The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.
</LEAR>

<KENT>	<4%>
	Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
	The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly
	When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?
	Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak
	When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound
	When majesty falls to folly. Reserve thy state;
	And, in thy best consideration, check
	This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,
	Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;
	Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
	Reverbs no hollowness.
</KENT>

<LEAR>	<5%>
	Kent, on thy life, no more.
</LEAR>

<KENT>	<5%>
	My life I never held but as a pawn
	To wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it,
	Thy safety being the motive.
</KENT>

<LEAR>	<5%>
	Out of my sight!
</LEAR>

<KENT>	<5%>
	See better, Lear; and let me still remain
	The true blank of thine eye.
</KENT>

<LEAR>	<5%>
	Now, by Apollo,—
</LEAR>

<KENT>	<5%>
	Now, by Apollo, king,
	Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.
</KENT>

<LEAR>	<5%>
	O vassal! miscreant!
</LEAR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Laying his hand on his sword.>
</STAGE DIR>

<ALBANY>	<5%>
	Dear sir, forbear.
</ALBANY>

<CORNWALL>	<5%>
	Dear sir, forbear.
</CORNWALL>

<KENT>	<5%>
	Do;
	Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
	Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift;
	Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,
	I'll tell thee thou dost evil.
</KENT>

<LEAR>	<5%>
	Hear me, recreant!
	On thine allegiance, hear me!
	Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,—
	Which we durst never yet,—and, with strain'd pride
	To come betwixt our sentence and our power,—
	Which nor our nature nor our place can hear,—
	Our potency made good, take thy reward.
	Five days we do allot thee for provision
	To shield thee from diseases of the world;
	And, on the sixth, to turn thy hated back
	Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following
	Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
	The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,
	This shall not be revok'd.
</LEAR>

<KENT>	<5%>
	Fare thee well, king; sith thus thou wilt appear,
	Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.
<STAGE DIR>
<To Cordelia.>
</STAGE DIR> The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,
	That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!
<STAGE DIR>
<To Regan and Goneril.>
</STAGE DIR> And your large speeches may your deeds approve,
	That good effects may spring from words of love.
	Thus Kent, O princes! bids you all adieu;
	He'll shape his old course in a country new.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>

</STAGE DIR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<6%>
	Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.
</GLOUCESTER>

<LEAR>	<6%>
	My Lord of Burgundy,
	We first address toward you, who with this king
	Hath rivall'd for our daughter. What, in the least,
	Will you require in present dower with her,
	Or cease your quest of love?
</LEAR>

<BURGANDY>	<6%>
	Most royal majesty,
	I crave no more than hath your highness offer'd,
	Nor will you tender less.
</BURGANDY>

<LEAR>	<6%>
	Right noble Burgundy,
	When she was dear to us we did hold her so,
	But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:
	If aught within that little-seeming substance,
	Or all of it, with our displeasure piec'd,
	And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,
	She's there, and she is yours.
</LEAR>

<BURGANDY>	<6%>
	I know no answer.
</BURGANDY>

<LEAR>	<6%>
	Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
	Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
	Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
	Take her, or leave her?
</LEAR>

<BURGANDY>	<6%>
	Pardon me, royal sir;
	Election makes not up on such conditions.
</BURGANDY>

<LEAR>	<6%>
	Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,
	I tell you all her wealth.—<STAGE DIR>
<To France.>
</STAGE DIR> For you, great king,
	I would not from your love make such a stray
	To match you where I hate; therefore, beseech you
	To avert your liking a more worthier way
	Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd
	Almost to acknowledge hers.
</LEAR>

<FRANCE>	<7%>
	This is most strange,
	That she, who even but now was your best object,
	The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
	The best, the dearest, should in this trice of time
	Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle
	So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence
	Must be of such unnatural degree
	That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
	Fall into taint; which to believe of her,
	Must be a faith that reason without miracle
	Could never plant in me.
</FRANCE>

<CORDELIA>	<7%>
	I yet beseech your majesty—
	If for I want that glib and oily art
	To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,
	I'll do 't before I speak—that you make known
	It is no vicious blot nor other foulness,
	No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
	That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour,
	But even for want of that for which I am richer,
	A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
	That I am glad I have not, though not to have it
	Hath lost me in your liking.
</CORDELIA>

<LEAR>	<7%>
	Better thou
	Hadst not been born than not to have pleas'd me better.
</LEAR>

<FRANCE>	<7%>
	Is it but this? a tardiness in nature
	Which often leaves the history unspoke
	That it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy,
	What say you to the lady? Love is not love
	When it is mingled with regards that stand
	Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?
	She is herself a dowry.
</FRANCE>

<BURGANDY>	<7%>
	Royal Lear,
	Give but that portion which yourself propos'd,
	And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
	Duchess of Burgundy.
</BURGANDY>

<LEAR>	<7%>
	Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.
</LEAR>

<BURGANDY>	<8%>
	I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father
	That you must lose a husband.
</BURGANDY>

<CORDELIA>	<8%>
	Peace be with Burgundy!
	Since that respects of fortune are his love,
	I shall not be his wife.
</CORDELIA>

<FRANCE>	<8%>
	Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;
	Most choice, forsaken; and most lov'd, despis'd!
	Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:
	Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.
	Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
	My love should kindle to inflam'd respect.
	Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,
	Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:
	Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
	Shall buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me.
	Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:
	Thou losest here, a better where to find.
</FRANCE>

<LEAR>	<8%>
	Thou hast her, France; let her be thine, for we
	Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
	That face of hers again, therefore be gone
	Without our grace, our love, our benison.
	Come, noble Burgundy.
</LEAR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Flourish. Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, Cornwall, Albany, Gloucester, and Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>

<FRANCE>	<8%>
	Bid farewell to your sisters.
</FRANCE>

<CORDELIA>	<8%>
	The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
	Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;
	And like a sister am most loath to call
	Your faults as they are nam'd. Use well our father:
	To your professed bosoms I commit him:
	But yet, alas! stood I within his grace,
	I would prefer him to a better place.
	So farewell to you both.
</CORDELIA>

<REGAN>	<8%>
	Prescribe not us our duties.
</REGAN>

<GONERIL>	<8%>
	Let your study
	Be to content your lord, who hath receiv'd you
	At fortune's alms; you have obedience scanted,
	And well are worth the want that you have wanted.
</GONERIL>

<CORDELIA>	<9%>
	Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides;
	Who covers faults, at last shame them derides.
	Well may you prosper!

<FRANCE>	<9%>
	Come, my fair Cordelia.
</FRANCE>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit France and Cordelia.>
</STAGE DIR>

<GONERIL>	<9%>
	Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both. I think our father will hence to-night.
</GONERIL>

<REGAN>	<9%>
	That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.
</REGAN>

<GONERIL>	<9%>
	You see how full of changes his age is; the observation we have made of it hath not been little: he always loved our sister most; and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly.
</GONERIL>

<REGAN>	<9%>
	'Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself.
</REGAN>

<GONERIL>	<9%>
	The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then, must we look to receive from his age, not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed condition, but, therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them.
</GONERIL>

<REGAN>	<9%>
	Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent's banishment.
</REGAN>

<GONERIL>	<9%>
	There is further compliment of leave-taking between France and him. Pray you, let us hit together: if our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of his will but offend us.
</GONERIL>

<REGAN>	<9%>
	We shall further think on't.
</REGAN>

<GONERIL>	<9%>
	We must do something, and i' the heat.

<Enter Edmund, with a letter.>
</STAGE DIR>
<EDMUND>	<9%>
	Thou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law
	My services are bound. Wherefore should I
	Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
	The curiosity of nations to deprive me,
	For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines
	Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?
	When my dimensions are as well compact,
	My mind as generous, and my shape as true,
	As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
	With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
	Who in the lusty stealth of nature take
	More composition and fierce quality
	Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,
	Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,
	Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well then,
	Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:
	Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
	As to the legitimate. Fine word, 'legitimate!'
	Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,
	And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
	Shall top the legitimate:—I grow, I prosper;
	Now, gods, stand up for bastards!

</EDMUND>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Gloucester.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GLOUCESTER>	<10%>
	Kent banished thus! And France in choler parted!
	And the king gone to-night! subscrib'd his power!
	Confin'd to exhibition! All this done
	Upon the gad! Edmund, how now! what news?
</GLOUCESTER>

<EDMUND>	<10%>
	So please your lordship, none.
</EDMUND>
<STAGE DIR>
<Putting up the letter.>
</STAGE DIR>

<GLOUCESTER>	<10%>
	Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?
</GLOUCESTER>

<EDMUND>	<10%>
	I know no news, my lord.
</EDMUND>

<GLOUCESTER>	<10%>
	What paper were you reading?
</GLOUCESTER>

<EDMUND>	<10%>
	Nothing, my lord.
</EDMUND>

<GLOUCESTER>	<10%>
	No? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket? the quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself. Let's see; come; if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.
</GLOUCESTER>

<EDMUND>	<10%>
	I beseech you, sir, pardon me; it is a letter from my brother that I have not all o'er-read, and for so much as I have perused, I find it not fit for your o'er-looking.
</EDMUND>

<GLOUCESTER>	<11%>
	Give me the letter, sir.
</GLOUCESTER>

<EDMUND>	<11%>
	I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.
</EDMUND>

<GLOUCESTER>	<11%>
	Let's see, let's see.
</GLOUCESTER>

<EDMUND>	<11%>
	I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.
</EDMUND>

<GLOUCESTER>	<11%>
	This policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny, who sways, not as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to me, that of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I waked him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your brother, <EDGAR.—HUM! CONSPIRACY! 'SLEEP TILL I WAKED HIM, YOU...>
</GLOUCESTER>
<... SHOULD ENJOY HALF HIS REVENUE.'—MY SON EDGAR!...>
<... HAD HE A HAND TO WRITE THIS? A HEART AND BRAIN...>
<... TO BREED IT IN? WHEN CAME THIS TO YOU? WHO BROUGHT IT?>
<EDMUND>	<11%>
	It was not brought me, my lord; there's the cunning of it; I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.
</EDMUND>

<GLOUCESTER>	<11%>
	You know the character to be your brother's?
</GLOUCESTER>

<EDMUND>	<11%>
	If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his; but, in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.
</EDMUND>

<GLOUCESTER>	<11%>
	It is his.
</GLOUCESTER>

<EDMUND>	<11%>
	It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the contents.
</EDMUND>

<GLOUCESTER>	<11%>
	Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?
</GLOUCESTER>

<EDMUND>	<11%>
	Never, my lord: but I have often heard him maintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declined, the father should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.
</EDMUND>

<GLOUCESTER>	<12%>
	O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him; I'll apprehend him. Abominable villain! Where is he?
</GLOUCESTER>

	I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain course; where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life for him, that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your honour, and to no other pretence of danger.

	These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond cracked between son and father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction; there's son against father: the king falls from bias of nature; there's father against child. We have seen the best of our time: machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing: do it carefully. And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his offence, honesty! 'Tis strange!

	This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in fortune,—often the surfeit of our own behaviour,—we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as if we were villains by necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance, drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father compounded with my mother under the dragon's tail, and my nativity was under ursa major; so that it follows I am rough and lecherous. 'Sfoot!

	Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,

<EDMUND>	<29%>
	Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;

	'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
	Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
	The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,
	Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
	To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,
	With his prepared sword he charges home
	My unprovided body, lanc'd mine arm:
	But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits
	Bold in the quarrel's right, rous'd to the encounter,
	Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
	Full suddenly he fled.
</EDMUND>

<GLOUCESTER>	<29%>
	Let him fly far:
	Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
	And found—dispatch. The noble duke my master,
	My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:
	By his authority I will proclaim it,
	That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,
	Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;
	He that conceals him, death.
</GLOUCESTER>

<EDMUND>	<29%>
	When I dissuaded him from his intent,
	And found him pight to do it, with curst speech

	'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,
	If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
	Of any trust, virtue, or worth, in thee
	Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny,—
	As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce
	My very character,—I'd turn it all
	To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice:
	And thou must make a dullard of the world,

	Were very pregnant and potential spurs
	To make thee seek it.'

	All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;

	O! reason not the need; our basest beggars

	Allow not nature more than nature needs,
	Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady;
	If only to go warm were gorgeous,
	Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,
	Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,—
	You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
	You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
	As full of grief as age; wretched in both!
	If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts
	Against their father, fool me not so much
	To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
	And let not women's weapons, water-drops,
	Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,
	I will have such revenges on you both
	That all the world shall—I will do such things,—
	What they are yet I know not,—but they shall be
	The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep;
	No, I'll not weep:
	I have full cause of weeping, but this heart
	Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
	Or ere I'll weep. O fool! I shall go mad.

	Sir, I do know you;
	And dare, upon the warrant of my note,
	Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,
	Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
	With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;
	Who have—as who have not, that their great stars
	Thron'd and set high—servants, who seem no less,
	Which are to France the spies and speculations
	Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,
	Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,
	Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
	Against the old kind king; or something deeper,
	Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;
	But, true it is, from France there comes a power
	Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,
	Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
	In some of our best ports, and are at point
	To show their open banner. Now to you:
	If on my credit you dare build so far
	To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
	Some that will thank you, making just report
	Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
	The king hath cause to plain.
	I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,
	And from some knowledge and assurance offer
	This office to you.

	And she will tell you who your fellow is
	That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
	I will go seek the king.

	Both stile and gate, horse-way and footpath. Poor Tom hath been scared out of his good wits: bless thee, good man's son, from the foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididance, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of stealing; Modo, of murder; and Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and mowing; who since possesses chambermaids and waiting-women. So, bless thee, master!

</STAGE DIR> Now, where's your master?
</GONERIL>

<OSWALD>	<68%>
	Madam, within; but never man so chang'd.
	I told him of the army that was landed;
	He smil'd at it: I told him you were coming;
	His answer was, 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,
	And of the loyal service of his son,
	When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,
	And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:
	What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
	What like, offensive.
</OSWALD>

<GONERIL>	<68%>
<STAGE DIR>
<To Edmund.>
</STAGE DIR> Then, shall you go no further.
	It is the cowish terror of his spirit
	That dares not undertake; he'll not feel wrongs
	Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
	May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;
	Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:
	I must change arms at home, and give the distaff
	Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant
	Shall pass between us; ere long you are like to hear,
	If you dare venture in your own behalf,
	A mistress's command. Wear this; spare speech;
<STAGE DIR>

<ALBANY>	<69%>
	O Goneril!
	You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
	Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:
	That nature, which contemns its origin,
	Cannot be border'd certain in itself;
	She that herself will sliver and disbranch
	From her material sap, perforce must wither
	And come to deadly use.
</ALBANY>

<GONERIL>	<69%>
	No more; the text is foolish.
</GONERIL>

<ALBANY>	<69%>
	Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;
	Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
	Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?
	A father, and a gracious aged man,
	Whose reverence the head-lugg'd bear would lick,
	Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.
	Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
	A man, a prince, by him so benefited!
	If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
	Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,
	It will come,
	Humanity must perforce prey on itself,
	Like monsters of the deep.
</ALBANY>

<GONERIL>	<69%>
	Milk-liver'd man!
	That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;
	Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
	Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st
	Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
	Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
	France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,
	With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats,
	Whilst thou, a moral fool, sitt'st still, and criest
	'Alack! why does he so?'

</STAGE DIR>
<KENT>	<71%>
	Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you the reason?
</KENT>

<GENTLEMAN>	<71%>
	Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his coming forth is thought of; which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger, that his personal return was most required and necessary.
</GENTLEMAN>

<KENT>	<71%>
	Who hath he left behind him general?
</KENT>

<GENTLEMAN>	<71%>
	The Marshal of France, Monsieur la Far.
</GENTLEMAN>

<KENT>	<71%>
	Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief?
</KENT>

<GENTLEMAN>	<71%>
	Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;
	And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
	Her delicate cheek; it seem'd she was a queen
	Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,
	Sought to be king o'er her.
</GENTLEMAN>

<KENT>	<71%>
	O! then it mov'd her.
</KENT>

<GENTLEMAN>	<71%>
	Not to a rage; patience and sorrow strove
	Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
	Sunshine and rain at once; her smiles and tears
	Were like a better way; those happy smilets
	That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know
	What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,
	As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,
	Sorrow would be a rarity most belov'd,
	If all could so become it.
</GENTLEMAN>

<KENT>	<72%>
	Made she no verbal question?
</KENT>

<GENTLEMAN>	<72%>
	Faith, once or twice she heav'd the name of 'father'
	Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart;
	Cried, 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!
	Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?
	Let pity not be believed!' There she shook
	The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
	And clamour-moisten'd, then away she started
	To deal with grief alone.
</GENTLEMAN>

<KENT>	<72%>
	It is the stars,
	The stars above us, govern our conditions;
	Else one self mate and make could not beget
	Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?
</KENT>

<GENTLEMAN>	<72%>
	No.
</GENTLEMAN>

</KENT>

<GENTLEMAN>	<72%>
	Why, good sir?
</GENTLEMAN>

<KENT>	<72%>
	A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,
	That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
	To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
	To his dog-hearted daughters,—these things sting
	His mind so venomously that burning shame
	Detains him from Cordelia.

	Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,

	The crows and choughs that wing the midway air

	The fishermen that walk upon the beach
	Appear like mice, and yond tall anchoring bark
	Diminish'd to her cock, her cock a buoy
	Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge,
	That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,

	Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flatter'd me like a dog, and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay' and 'no' to everything I said! 'Ay' and 'no' too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me once and the wind to make me chatter, when the thunder would not peace at my bidding, there I found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are not men o' their words: they told me I was every thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.

	Ay, every inch a king:
	When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
	I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?
	Adultery?
	Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
	The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly
	Does lecher in my sight.
	Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
	Was kinder to his father than my daughters
	Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
	To 't luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
	Behold yond simpering dame,
	Whose face between her forks presageth snow;
	That minces virtue, and does shake the head
	To hear of pleasure's name;
	The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to 't
	With a more riotous appetite.
	Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
	Though women all above:
	But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
	Beneath is all the fiends':
	There's hell, there's darkness, there is the sulphurous pit,

	Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor,

	By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;

	The bloody proclamation to escape

	That we the pain of death would hourly die
	Rather than die at once!—taught me to shift
	Into a madman's rags, to assume a semblance
	That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit
	Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
	Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,
	Led him, begg'd for him, sav'd him from despair;
	Never,—O fault!—reveal'd myself unto him,
	Until some half hour past, when I was arm'd;
	Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,
	I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
	Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,—
	Alack! too weak the conflict to support;
	'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
	Burst smilingly.

	He fasten'd on my neck, and bellow'd out
	As he'd burst heaven; threw him on my father;
	Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
	That ever ear receiv'd; which in recounting

	What is 't thou sayst? Her voice was ever soft,
	Gentle and low, an excellent thing in woman.
	I kill'd the slave that was a hanging thee.

<OFFICER>	<98%>
	'Tis true, my lord, he did.
</OFFICER>

<LEAR>	<98%>
	Did I not, fellow?
	I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
	I would have made them skip: I am old now,
	And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
	Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.
</LEAR>

<KENT>	<98%>
	If fortune brag of two she lov'd and hated,
	One of them we behold.
</KENT>

<LEAR>	<98%>
	This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?
</LEAR>

<KENT>	<99%>
	The same,
	Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?
</KENT>

<LEAR>	<99%>
	He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;
	He'll strike, and quickly too. He's dead and rotten.
</LEAR>

<KENT>	<99%>
	No, my good lord; I am the very man—
</KENT>

<LEAR>	<99%>
	I'll see that straight.
</LEAR>

<KENT>	<99%>
	That, from your first of difference and decay,
	Have follow'd your sad steps.
</KENT>

<LEAR>	<99%>
	You are welcome hither.
</LEAR>

<KENT>	<99%>
	Nor no man else; all's cheerless, dark, and deadly:
	Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,
	And desperately are dead.
</KENT>

<LEAR>	<99%>
	Ay, so I think.
</LEAR>

<ALBANY>	<99%>
	He knows not what he says, and vain it is
	That we present us to him.
</ALBANY>

<EDGAR>	<99%>
	Very bootless.

</EDGAR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter an Officer.>
</STAGE DIR>
<OFFICER>	<99%>
	Edmund is dead, my lord.
</OFFICER>

<ALBANY>	<99%>
	That's but a trifle here.
	You lords and noble friends, know our intent;
	What comfort to this great decay may come
	Shall be applied: for us, we will resign,
	During the life of this old majesty,
	To him our absolute power:—<STAGE DIR>
<To Edgar and Kent.>
</STAGE DIR> You, to your rights;
	With boot and such addition as your honours
	Have more than merited. All friends shall taste
	The wages of their virtue, and all foes
	The cup of their deservings. O! see, see!
</ALBANY>

<LEAR>	<99%>
	And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!
	Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
	And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
	Never, never, never, never, never!
	Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.
	Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,
	Look there, look there!
</LEAR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Dies.>
</STAGE DIR>

<EDGAR>	<99%>
	He faints!—my lord, my lord!
</EDGAR>

<KENT>	<99%>
	Break, heart; I prithee, break.
</KENT>

<EDGAR>	<100%>
	Look up, my lord.
</EDGAR>

<KENT>	<100%>
	Vex not his ghost: O! let him pass; he hates him
	That would upon the rack of this tough world
	Stretch him out longer.
</KENT>

<EDGAR>	<100%>
	He is gone, indeed.
</EDGAR>

<KENT>	<100%>
	The wonder is he hath endur'd so long:
	He but usurp'd his life.
</KENT>

<ALBANY>	<100%>
	Bear them from hence. Our present business
	Is general woe. <STAGE DIR>
<To Kent and Edgar.>
</STAGE DIR> Friends of my soul, you twain
	Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
</ALBANY>

<KENT>	<100%>
	I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;
	My master calls me, I must not say no.
</KENT>

<ALBANY>	<100%>
	The weight of this sad time we must obey;
	Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
	The oldest hath borne most: we that are young,
	Shall never see so much, nor live so long.
</ALBANY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt, with a dead march.>
