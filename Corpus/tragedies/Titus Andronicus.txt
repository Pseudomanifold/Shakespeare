<ACT 1>


<SCENE 1>
<Rome.>
<STAGE DIR>
<The Tomb of the Andronici appearing. The Tribunes...>
<... and Senators aloft; and then enter Saturninus...>
<... and his Followers at one door, and Bassianus and...>
<... his Followers at the other, with drum and colours.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SATURNINUS>	<1%>
	Noble patricians, patrons of my right,
	Defend the justice of my cause with arms;
	And, countrymen, my loving followers,
	Plead my successive title with your swords:
	I am his first-born son that was the last
	That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;
	Then let my father's honours live in me,
	Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
</SATURNINUS>

<BASSIANUS>	<1%>
	Romans, friends, followers, favourers of my right,
	If ever Bassianus, Cæsar's son,
	Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,
	Keep then this passage to the Capitol,
	And suffer not dishonour to approach
	The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,
	To justice, continence, and nobility;
	But let desert in pure election shine,
	And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.

</BASSIANUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Marcus Andronicus, aloft, with the crown.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MARCUS>	<1%>
	Princes, that strive by factions and by friends
	Ambitiously for rule and empery,
	Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand
	A special party, have, by common voice,
	In election for the Roman empery,
	Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius,
	For many good and great deserts to Rome:
	A nobler man, a braver warrior,
	Lives not this day within the city walls:
	He by the senate is accited home
	From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;
	That, with his sons, a terror to our foes,
	Hath yok'd a nation, strong, train'd up in arms.
	Ten years are spent since first he undertook
	This cause of Rome, and chastised with arms
	Our enemies' pride: five times he hath return'd
	Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons
	In coffins from the field;
	And now at last, laden with honour's spoils,
	Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
	Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.
	Let us entreat, by honour of his name,
	Whom worthily you would have now succeed,
	And in the Capitol and senate's right,
	Whom you pretend to honour and adore,
	That you withdraw you and abate your strength;
	Dismiss your followers, and, as suitors should,
	Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.
</MARCUS>

<SATURNINUS>	<2%>
	How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!
</SATURNINUS>

<BASSIANUS>	<2%>
	Marcus Andronicus, so I do affy
	In thy uprightness and integrity,
	And so I love and honour thee and thine,
	Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,
	And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,
	Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,
	That I will here dismiss my loving friends,
	And to my fortunes and the people's favour
	Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd.
</BASSIANUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt the Followers of Bassianus.>
</STAGE DIR>

<SATURNINUS>	<2%>
	Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,
	I thank you all and here dismiss you all;
	And to the love and favour of my country
	Commit myself, my person, and the cause.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt the Followers of Saturninus.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Rome, be as just and gracious unto me
	As I am confident and kind to thee.
	Open the gates, and let me in.
</SATURNINUS>

<BASSIANUS>	<3%>
	Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.
<STAGE DIR>
<Flourish. They go up into the Senate-house.>
</STAGE DIR>

</BASSIANUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter a Captain.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CAPTAIN>	<3%>
	Romans, make way! the good Andronicus,
	Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,
	Successful in the battles that he fights,
	With honour and with fortune is return'd
	From where he circumscribed with his sword,
	And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.

</CAPTAIN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Drums and trumpets sounded, and then enter Martius...>
<... and Mutius; after them two Men bearing a coffin...>
<... covered with black; then Lucius and Quintus. After...>
<... them Titus Andronicus; and then Tamora, with Alarbus,...>
<... Chiron, Demetrius, Aaron, and other Goths, prisoners;...>
<... Soldiers and people following. The bearers set down the coffin, and Titus speaks.>
</STAGE DIR>
<TITUS>	<3%>
	Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!
	Lo! as the bark, that hath discharg'd her fraught,
	Returns with precious lading to the bay
	From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,
	Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,
	To re-salute his country with his tears,
	Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.
	Thou great defender of this Capitol,
	Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!
	Romans, of five-and-twenty valiant sons,
	Half of the number that King Priam had,
	Behold the poor remains, alive, and dead!
	These that survive let Rome reward with love;
	These that I bring unto their latest home.
	With burial among their ancestors:
	Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.
	Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,
	Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet
	To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
	Make way to lay them by their brethren.
<STAGE DIR>
<The tomb is opened.>
</STAGE DIR>
	There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,
	And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars!
	O sacred receptacle of my joys,
	Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
	How many sons of mine hast thou in store,
	That thou wilt never render to me more!
</TITUS>

<LUCIUS>	<4%>
	Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,
	That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile
	Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh,
	Before this earthy prison of their bones;
	That so the shadows be not unappeas'd,
	Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
</LUCIUS>

<TITUS>	<5%>
	I give him you, the noblest that survives
	The eldest son of this distressed queen.
</TITUS>

<TAMORA>	<5%>
	Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,
	Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,
	A mother's tears in passion for her son:
	And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,
	O! think my son to be as dear to me.
	Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,
	To beautify thy triumphs and return,
	Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke;
	But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets
	For valiant doings in their country's cause?
	O! if to fight for king and commonweal
	Were piety in thine, it is in these.
	Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood:
	Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?
	Draw near them then in being merciful;
	Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge:
	Thrice-noble Titus, spare my first-born son.
</TAMORA>

<TITUS>	<5%>
	Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.
	These are their brethren, whom your Goths beheld
	Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain
	Religiously they ask a sacrifice:
	To this your son is mark'd, and die he must,
	To appease their groaning shadows that are gone.
</TITUS>

<LUCIUS>	<5%>
	Away with him! and make a fire straight;
	And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,
	Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consum'd.
</LUCIUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Lucius, Quintus, Martius, and Mutius, with Alarbus.>
</STAGE DIR>

<TAMORA>	<6%>
	O cruel, irreligious piety!
</TAMORA>

<CHIRON>	<6%>
	Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?
</CHIRON>

<DEMETRIUS>	<6%>
	Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
	Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive
	To tremble under Titus' threatening look.
	Then, madam, stand resolv'd; but hope withal
	The self-same gods, that arm'd the Queen of Troy
	With opportunity of sharp revenge
	Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,
	May favour Tamora, the Queen of Goths—
	When Goths were Goths, and Tamora was queen—
	To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.

</DEMETRIUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Lucius, Quintus, Martius, and Mutius, with their swords bloody.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LUCIUS>	<6%>
	See, lord and father, how we have perform'd
	Our Roman rites. Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,
	And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,
	Whose smoke, like incense, doth perfume the sky.
	Remaineth nought but to inter our brethren,
	And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.
</LUCIUS>

<TITUS>	<6%>
	Let it be so; and let Andronicus
	Make this his latest farewell to their souls.
<STAGE DIR>
<Trumpets sounded, and the coffin laid in the tomb.>
</STAGE DIR>
	In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;
	Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest,
	Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!
	Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,
	Here grow no damned drugs, here are no storms,
	No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:
	In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!

</TITUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Lavinia.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LAVINIA>	<7%>
	In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;
	My noble lord and father, live in fame!
	Lo! at this tomb my tributary tears
	I render for my brethren's obsequies;
	And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy
	Shed on the earth for thy return to Rome.
	O! bless me here with thy victorious hand,
	Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud.
</LAVINIA>

<TITUS>	<7%>
	Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserv'd
	The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!
	Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,
	And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise!

</TITUS>

<Enter Marcus Andronicus and Tribunes; re-enter Saturninus, Bassianus, and Others.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MARCUS>	<7%>
	Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,
	Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!
</MARCUS>

<TITUS>	<7%>
	Thanks, gentle Tribune, noble brother Marcus.
</TITUS>

<MARCUS>	<7%>
	And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,
	You that survive, and you that sleep in fame!
	Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all,
	That in your country's service drew your swords;
	But safer triumph is this funeral pomp,
	That hath aspir'd to Solon's happiness,
	And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.
	Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,
	Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,
	Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,
	This palliament of white and spotless hue;
	And name thee in election for the empire,
	With these our late-deceased emperor's sons:
	Be candidatus then, and put it on,
	And help to set a head on headless Rome.
</MARCUS>

<TITUS>	<8%>
	A better head her glorious body fits
	Than his that shakes for age and feebleness.
	What should I don this robe, and trouble you?
	Be chosen with proclamations to-day,
	To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,
	And set abroad new business for you all?
	Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
	And led my country's strength successfully,
	And buried one-and-twenty valiant sons,
	Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,
	In right and service of their noble country.
	Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
	But not a sceptre to control the world:
	Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
</TITUS>

<MARCUS>	<8%>
	Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.
</MARCUS>

<SATURNINUS>	<8%>
	Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?

<TITUS>	<8%>
	Patience, Prince Saturninus.
</TITUS>

<SATURNINUS>	<9%>
	Romans, do me right:
	Patricians, draw your swords, and sheathe them not
	Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor.
	Andronicus, would thou wert shipp'd to hell,
	Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!
</SATURNINUS>

<LUCIUS>	<9%>
	Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good
	That noble-minded Titus means to thee!
</LUCIUS>

<TITUS>	<9%>
	Content thee, prince; I will restore to thee
	The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.
</TITUS>

<BASSIANUS>	<9%>
	Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,
	But honour thee, and will do till I die:
	My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,
	I will most thankful be; and thanks to men
	Of noble minds is honourable meed.
</BASSIANUS>

<TITUS>	<9%>
	People of Rome, and people's tribunes here,
	I ask your voices and your suffrages:
	Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?
</TITUS>

<TRIBUNES>	<9%>
	To gratify the good Andronicus,
	And gratulate his safe return to Rome,
	The people will accept whom he admits.
</TRIBUNES>

<TITUS>	<9%>
	Tribunes, I thank you; and this suit I make,
	That you create your emperor's eldest son,
	Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,
	Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
	And ripen justice in this commonweal:
	Then, if you will elect by my advice,
	Crown him, and say, 'Long live our emperor!'
</TITUS>

<MARCUS>	<9%>
	With voices and applause of every sort,
	Patricians and plebeians, we create

	Titus Andronicus, for thy favours done
	To us in our election this day,
	I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,
	And will with deeds requite thy gentleness:
	And, for an onset, Titus, to advance
	Thy name and honourable family,
	Lavinia will I make my empress,
	Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
	And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse.
	Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?
</SATURNINUS>

<TITUS>	<10%>
	It doth, my worthy lord; and in this match
	I hold me highly honour'd of your Grace:
	And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine,
	King and commander of our commonweal,
	The wide world's emperor, do I consecrate
	My sword, my chariot, and my prisoners;
	Presents well worthy Rome's imperious lord:
	Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,
	Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet.
</TITUS>

<SATURNINUS>	<10%>
	Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life!
	How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
	Rome shall record, and, when I do forget
	The least of these unspeakable deserts,
	Romans, forget your fealty to me.

	Will use you nobly and your followers.
</TITUS>

<SATURNINUS>	<11%>
	A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue
	That I would choose, were I to choose anew.
	Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance:
	Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,
	Thou com'st not to be made a scorn in Rome:
	Princely shall be thy usage every way.
	Rest on my word, and let not discontent
	Daunt all your hopes: madam, he comforts you
	Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.
	Lavinia, you are not displeas'd with this?
</SATURNINUS>

<LAVINIA>	<11%>
	Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
	Warrants these words in princely courtesy.

	To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen,

	Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste

	A speedier course than lingering languishment
	Must we pursue, and I have found the path.
	My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;
	There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:
	The forest walks are wide and spacious,
	And many unfrequented plots there are
	Fitted by kind for rape and villany:
	Single you thither then this dainty doe,
	And strike her home by force, if not by words:
	This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.
	Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit
	To villany and vengeance consecrate,
	Will we acquaint with all that we intend;
	And she shall file our engines with advice,
	That will not suffer you to square yourselves,
	But to your wishes' height advance you both.
	The emperor's court is like the house of Fame,
	The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:
	The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;
	There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take your turns;
	There serve your lusts, shadow'd from heaven's eye,
	And revel in Lavinia's treasury.

	Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,
	Would make such fearful and confused cries,
	As any mortal body hearing it

	No sooner had they told this hellish tale,
	But straight they told me they would bind me here
	Unto the body of a dismal yew,
	And leave me to this miserable death:

	Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms

	Who's this? my niece, that flies away so fast?
	Cousin, a word; where is your husband?
	If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!
	If I do wake, some planet strike me down,
	That I may slumber in eternal sleep!
	Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands
	Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare
	Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,
	Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,
	And might not gain so great a happiness
	As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
	Alas! a crimson river of warm blood,
	Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,
	Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,
	Coming and going with thy honey breath.
	But, sure, some Tereus hath deflower'd thee,
	And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.
	Ah! now thou turn'st away thy face for shame;
	And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood,
	As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,
	Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face
	Blushing to be encounter'd with a cloud.
	Shall I speak for thee? shall I say 'tis so?
	O! that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,
	That I might rail at him to ease my mind.
	Sorrow concealed, like to an oven stopp'd,
	Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
	Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue,
	And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind:
	But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee;
	A craftier Tereus hast thou met withal,
	And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,
	That could have better sew'd than Philomel.
	O! had the monster seen those lily hands
	Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute,
	And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
	He would not, then, have touch'd them for his life;
	Or had he heard the heavenly harmony
	Which that sweet tongue hath made,
	He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep,
	As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.
	Come, let us go, and make thy father blind;
	For such a sight will blind a father's eye:
	One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
	What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?
	Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee:
	O! could our mourning ease thy misery.

	Why, 'tis no matter, man: if they did hear,
	They would not mark me, or if they did mark,
	They would not pity me, yet plead I must,
	All bootless unto them.
	Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones,
	Who, though they cannot answer my distress,
	Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,
	For that they will not intercept my tale.
	When I do weep, they humbly at my feet
	Receive my tears, and seem to weep with me;
	And, were they but attired in grave weeds,
	Rome could afford no tribune like to these.
	A stone is soft as wax, tribunes more hard than stones;
	A stone is silent, and offendeth not,
	And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.

	What fool hath added water to the sea,
	Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?
	My grief was at the height before thou cam'st;
	And now, like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.
	Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too;
	For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;
	And they have nurs'd this woe, in feeding life;
	In bootless prayer have they been held up,
	And they have serv'd me to effectless use:
	Now all the service I require of them
	Is that the one will help to cut the other.
	'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands,
	For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain.

<TITUS>	<44%>
	It was my dear; and he that wounded her
	Hath hurt me more than had he kill'd me dead:

	Environ'd with a wilderness of sea,
	Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,
	Expecting ever when some envious surge
	Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
	This way to death my wretched sons are gone;
	Here stands my other son, a banish'd man,
	And here my brother, weeping at my woes:
	But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,
	Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.
	Had I but seen thy picture in this plight
	It would have madded me: what shall I do
	Now I behold thy lively body so?
	Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears,
	Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyr'd thee:
	Thy husband he is dead, and for his death
	Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this.
	Look! Marcus; ah! son Lucius, look on her:
	When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears
	Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew
	Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd.
</TITUS>

<MARCUS>	<45%>
	Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;
	Perchance because she knows them innocent.

<TITUS>	<45%>
	If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,
	Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.
	No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;
	Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.
	Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips;
	Or make some sign how I may do thee ease.
	Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,
	And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,
	Looking all downwards, to behold our cheeks
	How they are stain'd, like meadows yet not dry,
	With miry alime left on them by a flood?
	And in the fountain shall we gaze so long
	Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,
	And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?

	Not far, one Muli lives, my countryman;

	His child is like to her, fair as you are:
	Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,

	And how by this their child shall be advanc'd,
	And be received for the emperor's heir,
	And substituted in the place of mine,

	Hark ye, lords; you see, I have given her physic,

<Pointing to the Nurse.>

	And that it comes from old Andronicus,
	Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.
	Ah! Rome. Well, well; I made thee miserable
	What time I threw the people's suffrages
	On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me.
	Go, get you gone; and pray be careful all,

	But even with law, against the wilful sons
	Of old Andronicus. And what an if
	His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,
	Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,
	His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?
	And now he writes to heaven for his redress:
	See, here's to Jove, and this to Mercury;
	This to Apollo; this to the god of war;
	Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!
	What's this but libelling against the senate,
	And blazoning our injustice every where?
	A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?
	As who would say, in Rome no justice were.
	But if I live, his feigned ecstasies
	Shall be no shelter to these outrages;
	But he and his shall know that justice lives

	Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do
	As much as ever Coriolanus did.

<SATURNINUS>	<76%>
	Is war-like Lucius general of the Goths?
	These tidings nip me, and I hang the head
	As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms.
	Ay, now begin our sorrows to approach:
	'Tis he the common people love so much;
	Myself hath often heard them say,
	When I have walked like a private man,
	That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,
	And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor.
</SATURNINUS>

<TAMORA>	<76%>
	Why should you fear? is not your city strong?
</TAMORA>

<SATURNINUS>	<76%>
	Ay, but the citizens favour Lucius,
	And will revolt from me to succour him.
</SATURNINUS>

<TAMORA>	<76%>
	King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name.
	Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?
	The eagle suffers little birds to sing,
	And is not careful what they mean thereby,
	Knowing that with the shadow of his wings
	He can at pleasure stint their melody;
	Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.
	Then cheer thy spirit; for know, thou emperor,
	I will enchant the old Andronicus
	With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,
	Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,
	Whenas the one is wounded with the bait,
	The other rotted with delicious feed.
</TAMORA>

<SATURNINUS>	<77%>
	But he will not entreat his son for us.
</SATURNINUS>

<TAMORA>	<77%>
	If Tamora entreat him, then he will:
	For I can smooth and fill his aged ear
	With golden promises, that, were his heart
	Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf,
	Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.

<To Æmilius.>

<SATURNINUS>	<77%>
	Æmilius, do this message honourably:

<GOTH 2>	<78%>
	Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd,
	To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;
	And as I earnestly did fix mine eye
	Upon the wasted building, suddenly
	I heard a child cry underneath a wall.
	I made unto the noise; when soon I heard
	The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:
	'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!
	Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,
	Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,
	Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:
	But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,
	They never do beget a coal-black calf.
	Peace, villain, peace!'—even thus he rates the babe,—
	'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;
	Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,
	Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'
	With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,
	Surpris'd him suddenly, and brought him hither,
	To use as you think needful of the man.
</GOTH 2>

<LUCIUS>	<79%>
	O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil
	That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand:
	This is the pearl that pleas'd your empress' eye,
	And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.
	Say, wall-ey'd slave, whither wouldst thou convey
	This growing image of thy fiend-like face?
	Why dost not speak? What! deaf? not a word?
	A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree,
	And by his side his fruit of bastardy.
</LUCIUS>

<AARON>	<79%>
	Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.
</AARON>

<AARON>	<79%>
	Lucius, save the child;

	If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,
	I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'
</AARON>

<LUCIUS>	<80%>
	Say on; and if it please me which thou speak'st,
	Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.
</LUCIUS>

<AARON>	<80%>
	An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,
	'Twill vex'thy soul to hear what I shall speak;
	For I must talk of murders, rapes, and massacres,

	Complots of mischief, treason, villanies

	And this shall all be buried by my death,

	What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;
	Yet, for I know thou art religious,
	And hast a thing within thee called conscience,
	With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,
	Which I have seen thee careful to observe,
	Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know
	An idiot holds his bauble for a god,
	And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,
	To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow
	By that same god, what god soe'er it be,

	To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up:
	Or else I will discover nought to thee.

	O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
</LUCIUS>

<AARON>	<81%>
	Tut! Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
	To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.
	'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus;
	They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her,
	And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.
</AARON>

<LUCIUS>	<81%>
	O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?
</LUCIUS>

<AARON>	<81%>
	Why, she was wash'd, and cut, and trimm'd, and 'twas

</AARON>

<LUCIUS>	<81%>
	O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!
</LUCIUS>

<AARON>	<81%>
	Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them.
	That codding spirit had they from their mother,
	As sure a card as ever won the set;
	That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me
	As true a dog as ever fought at head.
	Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.
	I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole
	Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay;
	I wrote the letter that thy father found,
	And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,
	Confederate with the queen and her two sons:
	And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,
	Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?
	I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,
	And, when I had it, drew myself apart,
	And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter.
	I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall
	When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;
	Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,
	That both mine eyes were rainy like to his:
	And when I told the empress of this sport,
	She swounded almost at my pleasing tale,
	And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.

</AARON>

<LUCIUS>	<82%>
	Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
</LUCIUS>

<AARON>	<82%>
	Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
	Even now I curse the day, and yet, I think,
	Few come within the compass of my curse,
	Wherein I did not some notorious ill:
	As kill a man, or else devise his death;
	Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it;
	Accuse some innocent, and forswear myself;
	Set deadly enmity between two friends;
	Make poor men's cattle break their necks;
	Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,
	And bid the owners quench them with their tears,
	Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,
	And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,
	Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;
	And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,
	Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,
	'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'
	Tut! I have done a thousand dreadful things
	As willingly as one would kill a fly,
	And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
	But that I cannot do ten thousand more.

	Come down, and welcome me to this world's light;
	Confer with me of murder and of death.
	There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,
	No vast obscurity or misty vale,
	Where bloody murder or detested rape
	Can couch for fear, but I will find them out;
	And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,
	Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.

	And whirl along with thee about the globe.
	Provide two proper palfreys, black as jet,
	To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,
	And find out murderers in their guilty caves:
	And when thy car is loaden with their heads,
	I will dismount, and by the waggon-wheel
	Trot like a servile footman all day long,
	Even from Hyperion's rising in the east
	Until his very downfall in the sea:
	And day by day I'll do this heavy task,

	You kill'd her husband, and for that vile fault

	My hand cut off and made a merry jest:
	Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear
	Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,
	Inhuman traitors, you constrain'd and forc'd.
	What would you say if I should let you speak?
	Villains! for shame you could not beg for grace.
	Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you.
	This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,
	Whilst that Levinia 'tween her stumps doth hold
	The basin that receives your guilty blood.
	You know your mother means to feast with me,
	And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad.
	Hark! villains, I will grind your bones to dust,
	And with your blood and it I'll make a paste;
	And of the paste a coffin I will rear,
	And make two pasties of your shameful heads;
	And bid that strumpet, your unhallow'd dam,
	Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
	This is the feast that I have bid her to,
	And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;
	For worse than Philomel you us'd my daughter,
	And worse than Procne I will be reveng'd.
	And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come.
<STAGE DIR>
<He cuts their throats.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,
	Let me go grind their bones to powder small,
	And with this hateful liquor temper it;
	And in that paste let their vile heads be bak'd.
	Come, come, be every one officious
	To make this banquet, which I wish may prove
	More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.
	So, now bring them in, for I will play the cook,
	And see them ready 'gainst their mother comes.

	And ours with thine, befall what fortune will.
</GOTH 1>

<LUCIUS>	<92%>
	Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,
	This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil;
	Let him receive no sustenance, fetter him,
	Till he be brought unto the empress' face,
	For testimony of her foul proceedings:
	And see the ambush of our friends be strong;
	I fear the emperor means no good to us.
</LUCIUS>

<AARON>	<92%>
	Some devil whisper curses in mine ear,
	And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forth
	The venomous malice of my swelling heart!
</AARON>

<LUCIUS>	<92%>
	Away, inhuman dog! unhallow'd slave!
	Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Goths, with Aaron. Trumpets sound.>

	What boots it thee, to call thyself a sun?
</LUCIUS>

<MARCUS>	<93%>
	Rome's emperor, and nephew, break the parle;
	These quarrels must be quietly debated.
	The feast is ready which the careful Titus
	Hath ordain'd to an honourable end,
	For peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome:
	Please you, therefore, draw nigh, and take your places.

	Marcus, we will.

<Enter Titus, dressed like a cook, Lavinia, veiled,...>
<... young Lucius, and Others. Titus places the dishes on the table.>
</STAGE DIR>
<TITUS>	<93%>
	Welcome, my gracious lord; welcome, dread queen;
	Welcome, ye war-like Goths; welcome, Lucius;
	And welcome, all. Although the cheer be poor,
	'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.
</TITUS>

<SATURNINUS>	<93%>
	Why art thou thus attir'd, Andronicus?
</SATURNINUS>

<TITUS>	<93%>
	Because I would be sure to have all well
	To entertain your highness, and your empress.
</TITUS>

<TAMORA>	<93%>
	We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.
</TAMORA>

<TITUS>	<93%>
	An if your highness knew my heart, you were.
	My lord the emperor, resolve me this:
	Was it well done of rash Virginius
	To slay his daughter with his own right hand,
	Because she was enforced, stain'd, and deflower'd?
</TITUS>

<SATURNINUS>	<94%>
	It was, Andronicus.
</SATURNINUS>

<TITUS>	<94%>
	Your reason, mighty lord?
</TITUS>

<SATURNINUS>	<94%>
	Because the girl should not survive her shame,
	And by her presence still renew his sorrows.
</SATURNINUS>

<TITUS>	<94%>
	A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;
	A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant,
	For me most wretched, to perform the like.
	Die, die. Lavinia, and thy shame with thee;
	And with thy shame thy father's sorrow die!
</TITUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Kills Lavinia.>
</STAGE DIR>

<SATURNINUS>	<94%>
	What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?
</SATURNINUS>

<TITUS>	<94%>
	Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind.
	I am as woeful as Virginius was,
	And have a thousand times more cause than he
	To do this outrage: and it is now done.
</TITUS>

<SATURNINUS>	<94%>
	What! was she ravish'd? tell who did the deed.
</SATURNINUS>

<TITUS>	<94%>
	Will 't please you eat? will 't please your highness feed?
</TITUS>

<TAMORA>	<94%>
	Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?
</TAMORA>

<TITUS>	<94%>
	Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius:
	They ravish'd her, and cut away her tongue:
	And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.
</TITUS>

<SATURNINUS>	<94%>
	Go fetch them hither to us presently.
</SATURNINUS>

<TITUS>	<94%>
	Why, there they are both, baked in that pie;
	Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,
	Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
	'Tis true, 'tis true; witness my knife's sharp point.
</TITUS>

	You sad-fac'd men, people and sons of Rome,
	By uproar sever'd, like a flight of fowl
	Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts,
	O! let me teach you how to knit again
	This scatter'd corn into one mutual sheaf,
	These broken limbs again into one body,
	Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,
	And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to,
	Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,
	Do shameful execution on herself.
	But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,
	Grave witnesses of true experience,
	Cannot induce you to attend my words,
<STAGE DIR>
<To Lucius.>
</STAGE DIR> Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,
	When with his solemn tongue he did discourse
	To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear
	The story of that baleful burning night
	When subtle Greeks surpris'd King Priam's Troy;
	Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,
	Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
	That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.
	My heart is not compact of flint nor steel,
	Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,
	But floods of tears will drown my oratory,
	And break my very utterance, even in the time
	When it should move you to attend me most,
	Lending your kind commiseration.
	Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;
	Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.
</MARCUS>

<LUCIUS>	<96%>
	Then, noble auditory, be it known to you,
	That cursed Chiron and Demetrius
	Were they that murdered our emperor's brother;
	And they it was that ravished our sister.
	For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded,
	Our father's tears despis'd, and basely cozen'd
	Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,
	And sent her enemies unto the grave:
	Lastly, myself unkindly banished,
	The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,
	To beg relief among Rome's enemies;
	Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears,
	And op'd their arms to embrace me as a friend:
	And I am the turn'd forth, be it known to you,
	That have preserv'd her welfare in my blood,
	And from her bosom took the enemy's point,
	Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.
	Alas! you know I am no vaunter, I;
	My scars can witness, dumb although they are,
	That my report is just and full of truth.
	But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,
	Citing my worthless praise: O! pardon me;
	For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.
</LUCIUS>

<MARCUS>	<97%>
	Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child;
	Of this was Tamora delivered,
	The issue of an irreligious Moor,
	Chief architect and plotter of these woes.
	The villain is alive in Titus' house,
	Damn'd as he is, to witness this is true.
	Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge
	These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,
	Or more than any living man could bear.
	Now you have heard the truth, what say you Romans?
	Have we done aught amiss, show us wherein,
	And, from the place where you behold us now,
	The poor remainder of Andronici
	Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down,
	And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,
	And make a mutual closure of our house.
	Speak, Romans, speak! and if you say we shall,
	Lo! hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.
</MARCUS>

<ÆMILIUS>	<97%>
	Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,
	And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,
	Lucius, our emperor; for well I know
	The common voice do cry it shall be so.

	Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so,
	To heal Rome's harms, and wipe away her woe!
	But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,
	For nature puts me to a heavy task.
	Stand all aloof; but, uncle, draw you near,
	To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.
	O! take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
<STAGE DIR>
<Kisses Titus.>
</STAGE DIR>
	These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face,
	The last true duties of thy noble son!
</LUCIUS>

	Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,
	Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:
	O! were the sum of these that I should pay
	Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them.
</MARCUS>

<LUCIUS>	<98%>
	Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us
	To melt in showers: thy grandsire lov'd thee well:
	Many a time he danc'd thee on his knee,
	Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow;
	Many a matter hath he told to thee,
	Meet and agreeing with thine infancy;
	In that respect, then, like a loving child,
	Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,
	Because kind nature doth require it so:
	Friends should associate friends in grief and woe.
	Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;
	Do him that kindness, and take leave of him.
</LUCIUS>

<BOY>	<99%>
	O grandsire, grandsire! even with all my heart
	Would I were dead, so you did live again.
	O Lord! I cannot speak to him for weeping;
	My tears will choke me if I ope my mouth.

	Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;
	There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food:
	If any one relieves or pities him,
	For the offence he dies. This is our doom:
	Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth.
</LUCIUS>

<AARON>	<99%>
	O! why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?
	I am no baby, I, that with base prayers
	I should repent the evils I have done.
	Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
	Would I perform, if I might have my will:
	If one good deed in all my life I did,
	I do repent it from my very soul.
</AARON>

<LUCIUS>	<99%>
	Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,
	And give him burial in his father's grave.
	My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
	Be closed in our household's monument.
	As for that heinous tiger, Tamora,
	No funeral rite, nor man in mournful weeds,
	No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
	But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey.
	Her life was beast-like, and devoid of pity;
	And, being so, shall have like want of pity.
	See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,
	By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:
	Then, afterwards, to order well the state,
	That like events may ne'er it ruinate.
