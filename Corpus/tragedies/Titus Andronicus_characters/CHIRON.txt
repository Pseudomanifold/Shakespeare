	Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all
	And so in this, to bear me down with braves.
	'Tis not the difference of a year or two
	Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:
	I am as able and as fit as thou
	To serve, and to deserve my mistress' grace;
	And that my sword upon thee shall approve,
	And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,
	Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	For that I am prepar'd and full resolv'd,
	Foul-spoken coward, that thunder'st with thy tongue,
	And with thy weapon nothing dar'st perform!
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	I care not, I, knew she and all the world:
	I love Lavinia more than all the world.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Aaron, a thousand deaths
	Would I propose, to achieve her whom I love.

	Ay, so the turn were serv'd.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Faith, not me.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
	And this for me, struck home to show my strength.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
	An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.
	Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
	And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
	I warrant you, madam, we will make that sure.
	Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
	That nice-preserved honesty of yours.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
	What! wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
	Nay, then I'll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband:
	This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.

	Write down thy mind, bewray thy meaning so;

	Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius;

	O! 'tis a verse in Horace; I know it well:
	I read it in the grammar long ago.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
	A charitable wish and full of love.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
	And that would she for twenty thousand more.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
	Belike, for joy the emperor hath a son.
