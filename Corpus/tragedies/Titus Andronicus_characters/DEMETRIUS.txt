	Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
	Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive
	To tremble under Titus' threatening look.
	Then, madam, stand resolv'd; but hope withal
	The self-same gods, that arm'd the Queen of Troy
	With opportunity of sharp revenge
	Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,
	May favour Tamora, the Queen of Goths—
	When Goths were Goths, and Tamora was queen—
	To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.

	Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge
	And manners, to intrude where I am grac'd,
	And may, for aught thou know'st, affected be.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
	Why, boy, although our mother, unadvis'd,
	Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,
	Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends?
	Go to; have your lath glu'd within your sheath
	Till you know better how to handle it.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	Not I, till I have sheath'd
	My rapier in his bosom, and withal
	Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat
	That he hath breath'd in my dishonour here.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:
	Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Why mak'st thou it so strange?
	She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;
	She is a woman, therefore may be won;
	She is Lavinia, therefore must be lov'd.
	What, man! more water glideth by the mill
	Than wots the miller of; and easy it is
	Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:
	Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother,
	Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Then why should he despair that knows to court it
	With words, fair looks, and liberality?
	What! hast thou not full often struck a doe,
	And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Aaron, thou hast hit it.

	How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!
	Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
	This is a witness that I am thy son.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
	Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her:
	First thrash the corn, than after burn the straw.
	This minion stood upon her chastity,
	Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,
	And with that painted hope she braves your mightiness:
	And shall she carry this unto her grave?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
	Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory
	To see her tears; but be your heart to them
	As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.

	Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.

	See, how with signs and tokens she can scrowl.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
