	Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid
	For that good hand thou sent'st the emperor.
	Here are the heads of thy two noble sons,
	And here's thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back:
	Thy griefs their sports, thy resolution mock'd;
	That woe is me to think upon thy woes,
	More than remembrance of my father's death.
