	Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!
	Lo! as the bark, that hath discharg'd her fraught,
	Returns with precious lading to the bay
	From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,
	Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,
	To re-salute his country with his tears,
	Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.
	Thou great defender of this Capitol,
	Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!
	Romans, of five-and-twenty valiant sons,
	Half of the number that King Priam had,
	Behold the poor remains, alive, and dead!
	These that survive let Rome reward with love;
	These that I bring unto their latest home.
	With burial among their ancestors:
	Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.
	Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,
	Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet
	To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
	Make way to lay them by their brethren.
	There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,
	And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars!
	O sacred receptacle of my joys,
	Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
	How many sons of mine hast thou in store,
	That thou wilt never render to me more!
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	I give him you, the noblest that survives
	The eldest son of this distressed queen.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.
	These are their brethren, whom your Goths beheld
	Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain
	Religiously they ask a sacrifice:
	To this your son is mark'd, and die he must,
	To appease their groaning shadows that are gone.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Let it be so; and let Andronicus
	Make this his latest farewell to their souls.
	In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;
	Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest,
	Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!
	Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,
	Here grow no damned drugs, here are no storms,
	No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:
	In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserv'd
	The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	Thanks, gentle Tribune, noble brother Marcus.

	And set abroad new business for you all?
	Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
	And led my country's strength successfully,
	And buried one-and-twenty valiant sons,
	Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,
	In right and service of their noble country.
	Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
	But not a sceptre to control the world:

	Tribunes, I thank you; and this suit I make,

	That all the court may echo with the noise.
	Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,
	To attend the emperor's person carefully:
	I have been troubled in my sleep this night,
	But dawning day new comfort hath inspir'd.
	Many good morrows to your majesty;

	High emperor, upon my feeble knee

	That this fell fault of my accursed sons,
	Accursed, if the fault be prov'd in them,—
<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	I did, my lord: yet let me be their bail;
	For, by my father's reverend tomb, I vow
	They shall be ready at your highness' will
	To answer their suspicion with their lives.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	Come, Lucius, come; stay not to talk with them.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!
	For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent
	In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept;
	For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed;
	For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd;
	And for these bitter tears, which now you see
	Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;
	Be pitiful to my condemned sons,
	Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.
	For two and twenty sons I never wept,
	Because they died in honour's lofty bed.
	For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I write
	My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears.
	Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;
	My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.
	O earth! I will befriend thee more with rain,
	That shall distil from these two ancient urns,
	Than youthful April shall with all his showers:
	In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;
	In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow,
	And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,
	So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.
	O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men!
	Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death:
	And let me say, that never wept before,
	My tears are now prevailing orators.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	Ah! Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.
	Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you,—
<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	Why, 'tis no matter, man: if they did hear,
	They would not mark me, or if they did mark,
	They would not pity me, yet plead I must,
	All bootless unto them.
	Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones,
	Who, though they cannot answer my distress,
	Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,
	For that they will not intercept my tale.
	When I do weep, they humbly at my feet
	Receive my tears, and seem to weep with me;
	And, were they but attired in grave weeds,
	Rome could afford no tribune like to these.
	A stone is soft as wax, tribunes more hard than stones;
	A stone is silent, and offendeth not,
	And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.
	But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?
<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	O happy man! they have befriended thee.
	Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive
	That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?
	Tigers must prey; and Rome affords no prey
	But me and mine: how happy art thou then,
	From these devourers to be banished!
	But who comes with our brother Marcus here?
<SPEECH 42><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Will it consume me? let me see it then.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Why, Marcus, so she is.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.
	Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand
	Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?
	What fool hath added water to the sea,
	Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?
	My grief was at the height before thou cam'st;
	And now, like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.
	Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too;
	For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;
	And they have nurs'd this woe, in feeding life;
	In bootless prayer have they been held up,
	And they have serv'd me to effectless use:
	Now all the service I require of them
	Is that the one will help to cut the other.
	'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands,
	For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	It was my dear; and he that wounded her
	Hath hurt me more than had he kill'd me dead:
	For now I stand as one upon a rock
	Environ'd with a wilderness of sea,
	Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,
	Expecting ever when some envious surge
	Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
	This way to death my wretched sons are gone;
	Here stands my other son, a banish'd man,
	And here my brother, weeping at my woes:
	But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,
	Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.
	Had I but seen thy picture in this plight
	It would have madded me: what shall I do
	Now I behold thy lively body so?
	Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears,
	Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyr'd thee:
	Thy husband he is dead, and for his death
	Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this.
	Look! Marcus; ah! son Lucius, look on her:
	When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears
	Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew
	Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,
	Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.
	No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;
	Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.
	Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips;
	Or make some sign how I may do thee ease.
	Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,
	And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,
	Looking all downwards, to behold our cheeks
	How they are stain'd, like meadows yet not dry,
	With miry alime left on them by a flood?
	And in the fountain shall we gaze so long
	Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,
	And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?
	Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine?
	Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows
	Pass the remainder of our hateful days?
	What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,
	Plot some device of further misery,
	To make us wonder'd at in time to come.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	Ah! Marcus, Marcus, brother; well I wot
	Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,
	For thou, poor man, hast drown'd it with thine own.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:
	Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say
	That to her brother which I said to thee:
	His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,
	Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.
	O! what a sympathy of woe is this;
	As far from help as limbo is from bliss.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!
	Did ever raven sing so like a lark,
	That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?
	With all my heart, I'll send the emperor my hand:
	Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?
<SPEECH 50><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Sirs, strive no more: such wither'd herbs as these
	Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Agree between you; I will spare my hand.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Come hither, Aaron; I'll deceive them both:

<SPEECH 53><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Now stay your strife: what shall be is dispatch'd.
	Good Aaron, give his majesty my hand:
	Tell him it was a hand that warded him
	From thousand dangers; bid him bury it;
	More hath it merited; that let it have.
	As for my sons, say I account of them
	As jewels purchas'd at an easy price;
	And yet dear too, because I bought mine own.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	O! here I lift this one hand up to heaven,
	And how this feeble ruin to the earth:
	If any power pities wretched tears,
	To that I call! <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> What! wilt thou kneel with me?
	Do, then, dear heart; for heaven shall hear our prayers,
	Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim,
	And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds
	When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?
	Then be my passions bottomless with them.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	If there were reason for these miseries,
	Then into limits could I bind my woes.
	When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?
	If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
	Threat'ning the welkin with his big-swoln face?
	And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
	I am the sea; hark! how her sighs do blow;
	She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:
	Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
	Then must my earth with her continual tears
	Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;
	For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,
	But like a drunkard must I vomit them.
	Then give me leave, for losers will have leave
	To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>

<SPEECH 58><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	Ha, ha, ha!
<SPEECH 59><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	Why, I have not another tear to shed:
	Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,
	And would usurp upon my watery eyes,
	And make them blind with tributary tears:
	Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?
	For these two heads do seem to speak to me,
	And threat me I shall never come to bliss
	Till all these mischiefs be return'd again
	Even in their throats that have committed them.
	Come, let me see what task I have to do.
	You heavy people, circle me about,
	That I may turn me to each one of you,
	And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
	The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head;
	And in this hand the other will I bear.
	Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd in these things:
	Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.
	As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight;
	Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay:
	Hie to the Goths, and raise an army there:
	And if you love me, as I think you do,
	Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.
<SPEECH 60><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	So, so; now sit; and look you eat no more
	Than will preserve just so much strength in us
	As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.
	Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:
	Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,
	And cannot passionate our ten-fold grief
	With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine
	Is left to tyrannize upon my breast;
	And when my heart, all mad with misery,
	Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,
	Then thus I thump it down.
	</STAGE DIR> Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!
	When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating
	Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.
	Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;
	Or get some little knife between thy teeth,
	And just against thy heart make thou a hole;
	That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall
	May run into that sink, and, soaking in,
	Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.
<SPEECH 61><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	How now! has sorrow made thee dote already?
	Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.
	What violent hands can she lay on her life?
	Ah! wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands;
	To bid Æaeas tell the tale twice o'er,
	How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?
	O! handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
	Lest we remember still that we have none.
	Fie, fie! how franticly I square my talk,
	As if we should forget we had no hands,
	If Marcus did not name the word of hands.
	Come, let's fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:
	Here is no drink. Hark, Marcus, what she says;
	I can interpret all her martyr'd signs:
	She says she drinks no other drink but tears,
	Brew'd with her sorrow, mash'd upon her cheeks.
	Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;
	In thy dumb action will I be as perfect
	As begging hermits in their holy prayers:
	Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,
	Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,
	But I of these will wrest an alphabet,
	And by still practice learn to know thy meaning.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,
	And tears will quickly melt thy life away.
	What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?
<SPEECH 63><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	Out on thee, murderer! thou kill'st my heart;
	Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny:
	A deed of death, done on the innocent,

	I see, thou art not for my company.

	But how if that fly had a father and a mother?
	How would he hang his slender gilded wings

	O, O, O!
	Then pardon me for reprehending thee,

	Come hither purposely to poison me.
	There's for thyself, and that's for Tamora.

	Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me:

	Come, and take choice of all my library,

	Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt,—
	O! had we never, never hunted there,—
	Pattern'd by that the poet here describes,
	By nature made for murders and for rapes.
<SPEECH 73><ACT 4><SCENE 1><58%>
	Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none but friends,
	What Roman lord it was durst do the deed:
	Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,
	That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?
<SPEECH 74><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
	O! do you read, my lord, what she hath writ?
	Stuprum, Chiron, Demetrius.
<SPEECH 75><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
	Magni dominator poli,
	Tam lentus audis scelera? tam lentus vides?
<SPEECH 76><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
	'Tis sure enough, an you knew how;
	But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware:
	The dam will wake, an if she wind you once:
	She's with the lion deeply still in league,
	And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,
	And when he sleeps will she do what she list.
	You're a young huntsman, Marcus; let it alone;
	And, come, I will go get a leaf of brass,
	And with a gad of steel will write these words,
	And lay it by: the angry northern wind
	Will blow these sands like Sibyl's leaves abroad,
	And where's your lesson then? Boy, what say you?
<SPEECH 77><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
	Come, go with me into mine armoury:
	Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal my boy
	Shall carry from me to the empress' sons
	Presents that I intend to send them both:
	Come, come; thou'lt do thy message, wilt thou not?
<SPEECH 78><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
	No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.
	Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house;
	Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court:
	Ay, marry, will we, sir; and we'll be waited on.
<SPEECH 79><ACT 4><SCENE 3><69%>
	Come, Marcus, come; kinsmen, this is the way.
	Sir boy, now let me see your archery:
	Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.
	Terras Astræa reliquit:
	Be you remember'd, Marcus, she's gone, she's fled.
	Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall
	Go sound the ocean, and cast your nets;
	Happily you may find her in the sea;
	Yet there's as little justice as at land.
	No; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it;
	'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,
	And pierce the inmost centre of the earth:
	Then, when you come to Pluto's region,
	I pray you, deliver him this petition;
	Tell him, it is for justice and for aid,
	And that it comes from old Andronicus,
	Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.
	Ah! Rome. Well, well; I made thee miserable
	What time I threw the people's suffrages
	On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me.
	Go, get you gone; and pray be careful all,
	And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd:
	This wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence;
	And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.
<SPEECH 80><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	Publius, how now! how now, my masters!
	What! have you met with her?
<SPEECH 81><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
	I'll dive into the burning lake below,
	And pull her out of Acheron by the heels.
	Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we;
	No big-bon'd men fram'd of the Cyclops' size;
	But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,
	Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear:
	And sith there's no justice in earth nor hell,
	We will solicit heaven and move the gods
	To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs.
	Come, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus.
	Ad Javem, that's for you: here, ad Apollinem:
	Ad Martem, that's for myself:
	Here, boy, to Pallas: here, to Mercury:
	To Saturn, Caius, not to Saturnine;
	You were as good to shoot against the wind.
	To it, boy! Marcus, loose when I bid.
	Of my word, I have written to effect;
	There's not a god left unsolicited.
<SPEECH 82><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
	Now, masters, draw. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> O! well said, Lucius!
	Good boy, in Virgo's lap: give it Pallas.
<SPEECH 83><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
	Ha! Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?
	See, see! thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns.
<SPEECH 84><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
	Why, there it goes: God give his lordship joy!
	News! news from heaven! Marcus, the post is come.
	Sirrah, what tidings? have you any letters?
	Shall I have justice? what says Jupiter?
<SPEECH 85><ACT 4><SCENE 3><72%>
	But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?
<SPEECH 86><ACT 4><SCENE 3><72%>
	Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?
<SPEECH 87><ACT 4><SCENE 3><72%>
	Why, didst thou not come from heaven?
<SPEECH 88><ACT 4><SCENE 3><72%>
	Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the emperor with a grace?
<SPEECH 89><ACT 4><SCENE 3><72%>
	Sirrah, come hither: make no more ado,
	But give your pigeons to the emperor:
	By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.
	Hold, hold; meanwhile, here's money for thy charges.
	Give me pen and ink.
	Sirrah, can you with a grace deliver a supplication?
<SPEECH 90><ACT 4><SCENE 3><72%>
	Then here is a supplication for you. And when you come to him, at the first approach you must kneel; then kiss his foot; then deliver up your pigeons; and then look for your reward. I'll be at hand, sir; see you do it bravely.
<SPEECH 91><ACT 4><SCENE 3><73%>
	Sirrah, hast thou a knife? Come, let me see it.
	Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;
	For thou hast made it like a humble suppliant:
	And when thou hast given it to the emperor,
	Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.
<SPEECH 92><ACT 4><SCENE 3><73%>
	Come, Marcus, let us go. Publius, follow me.
<SPEECH 93><ACT 5><SCENE 2><84%>
	Who doth molest my contemplation?
	Is it your trick to make me ope the door,
	That so my sad decrees may fly away,
	And all my study be to no effect?
	You are deceiv'd; for what I mean to do,
	See here, in bloody lines I have set down;
	And what is written shall be executed.
<SPEECH 94><ACT 5><SCENE 2><84%>
	No, not a word; how can I grace my talk,
	Wanting a hand to give it action?
	Thou hast the odds of me; therefore no more.
<SPEECH 95><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
	I am not mad; I know thee well enough:
	Witness this wretched stump, witness these crimson lines;
	Witness these trenches made by grief and care;
	Witness the tiring day and heavy night;
	Witness all sorrow, that I know thee well
	For our proud empress, mighty Tamora.
	Is not thy coming for my other hand?
<SPEECH 96><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
	Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me,
	To be a torment to mine enemies?
<SPEECH 97><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
	Do me some service ere I come to thee.
	Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;
	Now give some surance that thou art Revenge:
	Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot-wheels,
	And then I'll come and be thy waggoner,
	And whirl along with thee about the globe.
	Provide two proper palfreys, black as jet,
	To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,
	And find out murderers in their guilty caves:
	And when thy car is loaden with their heads,
	I will dismount, and by the waggon-wheel
	Trot like a servile footman all day long,
	Even from Hyperion's rising in the east
	Until his very downfall in the sea:
	And day by day I'll do this heavy task,
	So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.
<SPEECH 98><ACT 5><SCENE 2><86%>
	Are these thy ministers? what are they call'd?
<SPEECH 99><ACT 5><SCENE 2><86%>
	Good Lord, how like the empress' sons they are,
	And you the empress! but we worldly men
	Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.
	O sweet Revenge! now do I come to thee;
	And, if one arm's embracement will content thee,
	I will embrace thee in it by and by.
<SPEECH 100><ACT 5><SCENE 2><87%>
	Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee:
	Welcome, dread Fury, to my woeful house:
	Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.
	How like the empress and her sons you are!
	Well are you fitted had you but a Moor:
	Could not all hell afford you such a devil?
	For well I wot the empress never wags
	But in her company there is a Moor;
	And would you represent our queen aright,
	It were convenient you had such a devil.
	But welcome as you are. What shall we do?
<SPEECH 101><ACT 5><SCENE 2><87%>
	Look round about the wicked streets of Rome,
	And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself,
	Good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer.
	Go thou with him; and when it is thy hap
	To find another that is like to thee,
	Good Rapine, stab him; he's a ravisher.
	Go thou with them; and in the emperor's court
	There is a queen attended by a Moor;
	Well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion,
	For up and down she doth resemble thee:
	I pray thee, do on them some violent death;
	They have been violent to me and mine.
<SPEECH 102><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
	Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.
	Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius;
	Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths:
	Bid him repair to me, and bring with him
	Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths;
	Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are:
	Tell him, the emperor and the empress too
	Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.
	This do thou for my love; and so let him,
	As he regards his aged father's life.
<SPEECH 103><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me;
	Or else I'll call my brother back again,
	And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.
<SPEECH 104><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	</STAGE DIR> I know them all, though they suppose me mad;
	And will o'er-reach them in their own devices;
	A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam.
<SPEECH 105><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.
<SPEECH 106><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	Tut! I have work enough for you to do.
	Publius, come hither, Caius, and Valentine!
<SPEECH 107><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	Know you these two?
<SPEECH 108><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much deceiv'd;
	The one is Murder, Rape is the other's name;
	And therefore bind them, gentle Publius;
	Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them;
	Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,
	And now I find it: therefore bind them sure,
	And stop their mouths, if they begin to cry.
<SPEECH 109><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.
	Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me,
	But let them hear what fearful words I utter.
	O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!
	Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,
	This goodly summer with your winter mix'd.
	You kill'd her husband, and for that vile fault
	Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death,
	My hand cut off and made a merry jest:
	Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear
	Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,
	Inhuman traitors, you constrain'd and forc'd.
	What would you say if I should let you speak?
	Villains! for shame you could not beg for grace.
	Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you.
	This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,
	Whilst that Levinia 'tween her stumps doth hold
	The basin that receives your guilty blood.
	You know your mother means to feast with me,
	And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad.
	Hark! villains, I will grind your bones to dust,
	And with your blood and it I'll make a paste;
	And of the paste a coffin I will rear,
	And make two pasties of your shameful heads;
	And bid that strumpet, your unhallow'd dam,
	Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
	This is the feast that I have bid her to,
	And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;
	For worse than Philomel you us'd my daughter,
	And worse than Procne I will be reveng'd.
	And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come.
	Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,
	Let me go grind their bones to powder small,
	And with this hateful liquor temper it;
	And in that paste let their vile heads be bak'd.
	Come, come, be every one officious
	To make this banquet, which I wish may prove
	More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.
	So, now bring them in, for I will play the cook,
	And see them ready 'gainst their mother comes.
<SPEECH 110><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
	Welcome, my gracious lord; welcome, dread queen;
	Welcome, ye war-like Goths; welcome, Lucius;
	And welcome, all. Although the cheer be poor,
	'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.
<SPEECH 111><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
	Because I would be sure to have all well
	To entertain your highness, and your empress.
<SPEECH 112><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
	An if your highness knew my heart, you were.
	My lord the emperor, resolve me this:
	Was it well done of rash Virginius
	To slay his daughter with his own right hand,
	Because she was enforced, stain'd, and deflower'd?
<SPEECH 113><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
	Your reason, mighty lord?
<SPEECH 114><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
	A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;
	A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant,
	For me most wretched, to perform the like.
	Die, die. Lavinia, and thy shame with thee;
	And with thy shame thy father's sorrow die!
<SPEECH 115><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
	Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind.
	I am as woeful as Virginius was,
	And have a thousand times more cause than he
	To do this outrage: and it is now done.
<SPEECH 116><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
	Will 't please you eat? will 't please your highness feed?
<SPEECH 117><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
	Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius:
	They ravish'd her, and cut away her tongue:
	And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.
<SPEECH 118><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
	Why, there they are both, baked in that pie;
	Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,
	Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
	'Tis true, 'tis true; witness my knife's sharp point.
