	Noble patricians, patrons of my right,
	Defend the justice of my cause with arms;
	And, countrymen, my loving followers,
	Plead my successive title with your swords:
	I am his first-born son that was the last
	That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;
	Then let my father's honours live in me,
	Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,
	I thank you all and here dismiss you all;
	And to the love and favour of my country
	Commit myself, my person, and the cause.
	Rome, be as just and gracious unto me
	As I am confident and kind to thee.
	Open the gates, and let me in.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	Romans, do me right:
	Patricians, draw your swords, and sheathe them not
	Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor.
	Andronicus, would thou wert shipp'd to hell,
	Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	Titus Andronicus, for thy favours done
	To us in our election this day,
	I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,
	And will with deeds requite thy gentleness:
	And, for an onset, Titus, to advance
	Thy name and honourable family,
	Lavinia will I make my empress,
	Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
	And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse.
	Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life!
	How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
	Rome shall record, and, when I do forget
	The least of these unspeakable deserts,
	Romans, forget your fealty to me.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><11%>
	A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue
	That I would choose, were I to choose anew.
	Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance:
	Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,
	Thou com'st not to be made a scorn in Rome:
	Princely shall be thy usage every way.
	Rest on my word, and let not discontent
	Daunt all your hopes: madam, he comforts you
	Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.
	Lavinia, you are not displeas'd with this?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><11%>
	Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go;
	Ransomless here we set our prisoners free:
	Proclaim our honours, lords, with trump and drum.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><12%>
	Surpris'd! By whom?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><12%>
	No, Titus, no; the emperor needs her not,
	Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:
	I'll trust, by leisure, him that mocks me once;
	Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,
	Confederates all thus to dishonour me.
	Was none in Rome to make a stale
	But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,
	Agreed these deeds with that proud brag of thine,
	That saidst I begg'd the empire at thy hands.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><13%>
	But go thy ways; go, give that changing piece
	To him that flourish'd for her with his sword.
	A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
	One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,
	To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><13%>
	And therefore, lovely Tamora, Queen of Goths,
	That like the stately Phœbe 'mongst her nymphs,
	Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
	If thou be pleas'd with this my sudden choice,
	Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride,
	And will create thee Empress of Rome.
	Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?
	And here I swear by all the Roman gods,
	Sith priest and holy water are so near,
	And tapers burn so bright, and every thing
	In readiness for Hymenæus stand,
	I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,
	Or climb my palace, till from forth this place
	I lead espous'd my bride along with me.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 1><14%>
	Ascend, fair queen, Pantheon. Lords, accompany
	Your noble emperor, and his lovely bride,
	Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,
	Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered:
	There shall we consummate our spousal rights.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 1><16%>
	So, Bassianus, you have play'd your prize:
	God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 1><17%>
	Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power,
	Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 1><17%>
	'Tis good, sir: you are very short with us;
	But, if we live, we'll be as sharp with you.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 1><18%>
	What, madam! be dishonour'd openly,
	And basely put it up without revenge?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 1><19%>
	Rise, Titus, rise; my empress hath prevail'd.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 1><19%>
	Away, and talk not; trouble us no more.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 1><19%>
	Marcus, for thy sake, and thy brother's here,
	And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,
	I do remit these young men's heinous faults:
	Stand up.
	Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,
	I found a friend, and sure as death I swore
	I would not part a bachelor from the priest.
	Come; if the emperor's court can feast two brides,
	You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.
	This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 1><20%>
	Be it so, Titus, and gramercy too.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	And you have rung it lustily, my lord;
	Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	Come on, then; horse and chariots let us have,
	And to our sport.—<STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Madam, now shall ye see
	Our Roman hunting.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	Along with me: I'll see what hole is here,
	And what he is that now is leap'd into it.
	Say, who art thou that lately didst descend
	Into this gaping hollow of the earth?
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:
	He and his lady both are at the lodge,
	Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
	'Tis not an hour since I left him there.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	Here, Tamora; though griev'd with killing grief.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:
	Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	And if we miss to meet him handsomely,
	Sweet huntsman, Bassianus 'tis we mean,
	Do thou so much as dig the grave for him:
	Thou know'st our meaning. Look for thy reward
	Among the nettles at the elder-tree
	Which overshades the mouth of that same pit
	Where we decreed to bury Bassianus:
	Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.
	O Tamora! was ever heard the like?
	This is the pit, and this the elder-tree.
	Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out
	That should have murder'd Bassianus here.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	</STAGE DIR> Two of thy whelps, fell curs of bloody kind,
	Have here bereft my brother of his life.
	Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison:
	There let them bide until we have devis'd
	Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	If it be prov'd! you see it is apparent.
	Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?
<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me.
	Some bring the murder'd body, some the murderers:
	Let them not speak a word; the guilt is plain;
	For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,
	That end upon them should be executed.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 4><73%>
	Why, lords, what wrongs are these! Was ever seen
	An emperor of Rome thus overborne,
	Troubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent
	Of egal justice, us'd in such contempt?
	My lords, you know, as do the mightful gods,—
	However these disturbers of our peace
	Buzz in the people's ears,—there nought hath pass'd,
	But even with law, against the wilful sons
	Of old Andronicus. And what an if
	His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,
	Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,
	His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?
	And now he writes to heaven for his redress:
	See, here's to Jove, and this to Mercury;
	This to Apollo; this to the god of war;
	Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!
	What's this but libelling against the senate,
	And blazoning our injustice every where?
	A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?
	As who would say, in Rome no justice were.
	But if I live, his feigned ecstasies
	Shall be no shelter to these outrages;
	But he and his shall know that justice lives
	In Saturninus' health; whom, if she sleep,
	He'll so awake, as she in fury shall
	Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	Go, take him away, and hang him presently.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
	Shall I endure this monstrous villany?
	I know from whence this same device proceeds:
	May this be borne? As if his traitorous sons,
	That died by law for murder of our brother,
	Have by my means been butcher'd wrongfully!
	Go, drag the villain hither by the hair;
	Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege.
	For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman;
	Sly frantic wretch, that holp'st to make me great,
	In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.
	What news with thee, Æmilius?
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
	Is war-like Lucius general of the Goths?
	These tidings nip me, and I hang the head
	As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms.
	Ay, now begin our sorrows to approach:
	'Tis he the common people love so much;
	Myself hath often heard them say,
	When I have walked like a private man,
	That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,
	And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
	Ay, but the citizens favour Lucius,
	And will revolt from me to succour him.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 4><77%>
	But he will not entreat his son for us.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 4><77%>
	Æmilius, do this message honourably:
	And if he stand on hostage for his safety,
	Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 4><SCENE 4><77%>
	Then go successantly, and plead to him.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
	What! hath the firmament more suns than one?
<SPEECH 42><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
	Why art thou thus attir'd, Andronicus?
<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
	It was, Andronicus.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
	Because the girl should not survive her shame,
	And by her presence still renew his sorrows.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
	What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?
<SPEECH 47><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
	What! was she ravish'd? tell who did the deed.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
	Go fetch them hither to us presently.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 5><SCENE 3><95%>
	Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!
