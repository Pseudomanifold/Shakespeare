	The king comes here to-night.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 5><15%>
	So please you, it is true: our thane is coming;
	One of my fellows had the speed of him,
	Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
	Than would make up his message.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 2><70%>
	Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,
	Though in your state of honour I am perfect.
	I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:
	If you will take a homely man's advice,
	Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.
	To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;
	To do worse to you were fell cruelty,
	Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!
	I dare abide no longer.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 5><SCENE 5><93%>
	Gracious my lord,
	I should report that which I say I saw,
	But know not how to do it.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 5><SCENE 5><93%>
	As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
	I look'd towards Birnam, and anon, methought,
	The wood began to move.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 5><SCENE 5><93%>
	Let me endure your wrath if't be not so:
	Within this three mile may you see it coming;
	I say, a moving grove.
