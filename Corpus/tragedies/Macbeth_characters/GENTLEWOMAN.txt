	Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon 't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.

	That, sir, which I will not report after her.

	Neither to you nor any one, having no witness to confirm my speech.
	Lo you! here she comes. This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.

	Why, it stood by her: she has light by her continually; 'tis her command.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>

	Pray God it be, sir.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	Directly.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	Good-night, good doctor.
