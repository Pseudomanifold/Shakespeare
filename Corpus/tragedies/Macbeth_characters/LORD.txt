	The son of Duncan,
	From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,
	Lives in the English court, and is receiv'd
	Of the most pious Edward with such grace
	That the malevolence of fortune nothing
	Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff
	Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid
	To wake Northumberland and war-like Siward:
	That, by the help of these—with him above
	To ratify the work—we may again
	Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
	Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
	Do faithful homage and receive free honours;
	All which we pine for now. And this report
	Hath so exasperate the king that he
	Prepares for some attempt at war.

	He did: and with an absolute, 'Sir, not I,'
	The cloudy messenger turns me his back,
	And hums, as who should say, 'You'll rue the time
	That clogs me with this answer.'

	I'll send my prayers with him!
