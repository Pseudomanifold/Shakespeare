	Doubtful it stood;
	As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
	And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald—
	Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
	The multiplying villanies of nature
	Do swarm upon him—from the western isles
	Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
	And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
	Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak;
	For brave Macbeth,—well he deserves that name,—
	Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
	Which smok'd with bloody execution,
	Like valour's minion carv'd out his passage
	Till he fac'd the slave;
	Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
	Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
	And fix'd his head upon our battlements.

	As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
	Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break,
	So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
	Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark:
	No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
	Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
	But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,
	With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
	Began a fresh assault.

	Yes;
	As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
	If I say sooth, I must report they were
	As cannons overcharg'd with double cracks;
	So they
	Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
	Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
	Or memorize another Golgotha,
	I cannot tell—
	But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.
