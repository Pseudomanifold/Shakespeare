	Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
	The Volsces are in arms.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	Then, worthy Marcius,
	Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	Your company to the Capitol; where I know
	Our greatest friends attend us.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	</STAGE DIR> Hence! to your homes! be gone.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
	That they of Rome are enter'd in our counsels,
	And know how we proceed.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	Our army's in the field:
	We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
	To answer us.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	Farewell.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 4><13%>
	No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
	That's lesser than a little. Hark, our drums
	Are bringing forth our youth: we'll break our walls,
	Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,
	Which yet seem shut, we have but pinn'd with rushes;
	They'll open of themselves. Hark you, far off!
	There is Aufidius: list, what work he makes
	Amongst your cloven army.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
	Speak, good Cominius:
	Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
	Rather our state's defective for requital,
	Than we to stretch it out. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Masters o' the people,
	We do request your kindest ears, and, after,
	Your loving motion toward the common body,
	To yield what passes here.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
	Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear
	What you have nobly done.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
	He cannot but with measure fit the honours
	Which we devise him.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
	Call Coriolanus.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	Not in this heat, sir, now.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	No more words, we beseech you.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	The gods forbid!
	I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
	Leave us to cure this cause.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 1><54%>
	Noble tribunes,
	It is the humane way: the other course
	Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
	Unknown to the beginning.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 1><54%>
	Pray you, let's to him.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	There's no remedy;
	Unless, by not so doing, our good city
	Cleave in the midst, and perish.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	Amen, amen.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
	Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
	Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,
	And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:
	Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius;
	Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;
	Cry, 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'
