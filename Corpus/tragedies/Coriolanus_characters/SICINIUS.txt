	Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	When we were chosen tribunes for the people,—
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	Nay, but his taunts.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	Bemock the modest moon.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	Such a nature,
	Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
	Which he treads on at noon. But I do wonder
	His insolence can brook to be commanded
	Under Cominius.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	Besides, if things go well,
	Opinion, that so sticks on Marcius, shall
	Of his demerits rob Cominius.

	Let's hence and hear
	How the dispatch is made; and in what fashion,
	More than his singularity, he goes
	Upon this present action.

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Well, sir.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Especially in pride.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	Menenius, you are known well enough too.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
	On the sudden
	I warrant him consul.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
	He cannot temperately transport his honours
	From where he should begin and end, but will
	Lose those he hath won.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
	Doubt not, the commoners, for whom we stand,
	But they upon their ancient malice will
	Forget with the least cause these his new honours,
	Which that he'll give them, make I as little question
	As he is proud to do't.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
	'Tis right.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
	I wish no better
	Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
	In execution.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 1><31%>
	It shall be to him then, as our good wills,
	A sure destruction.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 1><31%>
	This, as you say, suggested
	At some time when his soaring insolence
	Shall teach the people—which time shall not want,
	If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy
	As to set dogs on sheep—will be his fire
	To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
	Shall darken him for ever.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 1><31%>
	Have with you.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 2><36%>
	Sir, the people
	Must have their voices; neither will they bate
	One jot of ceremony.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 2><36%>
	May they perceive 's intent! He will require them,
	As if he did contemn what he requested
	Should be in them to give.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
	The custom of request you have discharg'd:
	The people do admit you, and are summon'd
	To meet anon, upon your approbation.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
	There, Coriolanus.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
	You may, sir.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
	Fare you well.
	He has it now; and by his looks, methinks,
	'Tis warm at's heart.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
	How now, my masters! have you chose this man?
<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
	Why, so he did, I am sure.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
	Why, either were you ignorant to see 't,
	Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
	To yield your voices?
<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 3><42%>
	Thus to have said,
	As you were fore-advis'd, had touch'd his spirit
	And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
	Either his gracious promise, which you might,
	As cause had call'd you up, have held him to;
	Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
	Which easily endures not article
	Tying him to aught; so, putting him to rage,
	You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler,
	And pass'd him unelected.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 3><42%>
	Have you
	Ere now denied the asker? and now again
	Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow
	Your su'd-for tongues?
<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 3><43%>
	Let them assemble;
	And, on a safer judgment, all revoke
	Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride,
	And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
	With what contempt he wore the humble weed;
	How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
	Thinking upon his services, took from you
	The apprehension of his present portance,
	Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
	After the inveterate hate he bears you.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 3><43%>
	Say, you chose him
	More after our commandment than as guided
	By your own true affections; and that, your minds,
	Pre-occupied with what you rather must do
	Than what you should, made you against the grain
	To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 3><43%>
	One thus descended,
	That hath, beside, well in his person wrought
	To be set high in place, we did commend
	To your remembrances: but you have found,
	Scaling his present bearing with his past,
	That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
	Your sudden approbation.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 3><44%>
	To the Capitol, come:
	We will be there before the stream o' the people;
	And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,
	Which we have goaded onward.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Pass no further.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Stop,
	Or all will fall in broil.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	You show too much of that
	For which the people stir; if you will pass
	To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
	Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit;
	Or never be so noble as a consul,
	Nor yoke with him for tribune.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	'Twere well
	We let the people know't.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	It is a mind
	That shall remain a poison where it is,
	Not poison any further.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	He has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
	As traitors do.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	This a consul? no.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	Go, call the people; <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> in whose name, myself
	Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
	A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,
	And follow to thine answer.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	Help, ye citizens!
<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	Here's he that would take from you all your power.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	Hear me, people; peace!
<SPEECH 48><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	You are at point to lose your liberties:
	Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
	Whom late you have nam'd for consul.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	What is the city but the people?
<SPEECH 50><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	This deserves death.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	Therefore lay hold of him;
	Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence
	Into destruction cast him.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	Where is this viper
	That would depopulate the city and
	Be every man himself?
<SPEECH 53><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
	With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
	And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
	Than the severity of the public power,
	Which he so sets at nought.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	Peace!
<SPEECH 55><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	Sir, how comes 't that you
	Have holp to make this rescue?
<SPEECH 56><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	Consul! what consul?
<SPEECH 57><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	Speak briefly then;
	For we are peremptory to dispatch
	This viperous traitor. To eject him hence
	Were but one danger, and to keep him here
	Our certain death; therefore it is decreed
	He dies to-night.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 3><SCENE 1><53%>
	He's a disease that must be cut away.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 3><SCENE 1><53%>
	This is clean kam.
<SPEECH 60><ACT 3><SCENE 1><53%>
	What do ye talk?
	Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
	Our ædiles smote? ourselves resisted? Come!
<SPEECH 61><ACT 3><SCENE 1><54%>
	Noble Menenius,
	Be you then as the people's officer.
	Masters, lay down your weapons.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 3><SCENE 1><54%>
	Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:
	Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
	In our first way.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	Have you a catalogue
	Of all the voices that we have procur'd,
	Set down by the poll?
<SPEECH 64><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	Have you collected them by tribes?
<SPEECH 65><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	Assemble presently the people hither;
	And when they hear me say, 'It shall be so,
	I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either
	For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them,
	If I say, fine, cry 'fine,'—if death, cry 'death,'
	Insisting on the old prerogative
	And power i' the truth o' the cause.
<SPEECH 66><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	Make them be strong and ready for this hint,
	When we shall hap to give 't them.
<SPEECH 67><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	Well, here he comes.
<SPEECH 68><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	Draw near, ye people.
<SPEECH 69><ACT 3><SCENE 3><60%>
	I do demand,
	If you submit you to the people's voices,
	Allow their officers, and are content
	To suffer lawful censure for such faults
	As shall be prov'd upon you?
<SPEECH 70><ACT 3><SCENE 3><60%>
	Answer to us.
<SPEECH 71><ACT 3><SCENE 3><60%>
	We charge you, that you have contriv'd to take
	From Rome all season'd office, and to wind
	Yourself into a power tyrannical;
	For which you are a traitor to the people.
<SPEECH 72><ACT 3><SCENE 3><60%>
	Mark you this, people!
<SPEECH 73><ACT 3><SCENE 3><61%>
	Peace!
	We need not put new matter to his charge:
	What you have seen him do, and heard him speak,
	Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
	Opposing laws with strokes, and here defying
	Those whose great power must try him; even this,
	So criminal and in such capital kind,
	Deserves the extremest death.
<SPEECH 74><ACT 3><SCENE 3><61%>
	For that he has,—
	As much as in him lies,—from time to time
	Envied against the people, seeking means
	To pluck away their power, as now at last
	Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
	Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
	That do distribute it; in the name o' the people,
	And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
	Even from this instant, banish him our city,
	In peril of precipitation
	From off the rock Tarpeian, never more
	To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,
	I say, it shall be so.
<SPEECH 75><ACT 3><SCENE 3><61%>
	He's sentenc'd; no more hearing.
<SPEECH 76><ACT 3><SCENE 3><62%>
	We know your drift: speak what?
<SPEECH 77><ACT 3><SCENE 3><62%>
	Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,
	As he hath follow'd you, with all despite;
	Give him deserv'd vexation. Let a guard
	Attend us through the city.
<SPEECH 78><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
	Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.
	The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
	In his behalf.
<SPEECH 79><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
	Bid them home;
	Say their great enemy is gone, and they
	Stand in their ancient strength.
<SPEECH 80><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	Let's not meet her.
<SPEECH 81><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	They say she's mad.
<SPEECH 82><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	Are you mankind?
<SPEECH 83><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	O blessed heavens!
<SPEECH 84><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	What then?
<SPEECH 85><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	I would he had continu'd to his country
	As he began, and not unknit himself
	The noble knot he made.
<SPEECH 86><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Why stay we to be baited
	With one that wants her wits?
<SPEECH 87><ACT 4><SCENE 6><75%>
	We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;
	His remedies are tame i' the present peace
	And quietness o' the people, which before
	Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
	Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,
	Though they themselves did suffer by 't, behold
	Dissentious numbers pestering streets, than see
	Our tradesmen singing in their shops and going
	About their functions friendly.
<SPEECH 88><ACT 4><SCENE 6><75%>
	'Tis he, 'tis he O! he is grown most kind
	Of late. Hail, sir!
<SPEECH 89><ACT 4><SCENE 6><76%>
	Your Coriolanus is not much miss'd
	But with his friends: the commonwealth doth stand,
	And so would do, were he more angry at it.
<SPEECH 90><ACT 4><SCENE 6><76%>
	Where is he, hear you?
<SPEECH 91><ACT 4><SCENE 6><76%>
	Good den, our neighbours.
<SPEECH 92><ACT 4><SCENE 6><76%>
	Live, and thrive!
<SPEECH 93><ACT 4><SCENE 6><76%>
	Farewell, farewell.
<SPEECH 94><ACT 4><SCENE 6><76%>
	This is a happier and more comely time
	Than when these fellows ran about the streets
	Crying confusion.
<SPEECH 95><ACT 4><SCENE 6><76%>
	And affecting one sole throne.
	Without assistance.
<SPEECH 96><ACT 4><SCENE 6><76%>
	We should by this, to all our lamentation,
	If he had gone forth consul, found it so.
<SPEECH 97><ACT 4><SCENE 6><77%>
	Come, what talk you of Marcius?
<SPEECH 98><ACT 4><SCENE 6><77%>
	Tell not me:
	I know this cannot be.
<SPEECH 99><ACT 4><SCENE 6><77%>
	'Tis this slave.—
	Go whip him 'fore the people's eyes: his raising;
	Nothing but his report.
<SPEECH 100><ACT 4><SCENE 6><77%>
	What more fearful?
<SPEECH 101><ACT 4><SCENE 6><77%>
	This is most likely.
<SPEECH 102><ACT 4><SCENE 6><77%>
	The very trick on 't.
<SPEECH 103><ACT 4><SCENE 6><79%>
	Say not we brought it.
<SPEECH 104><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
	Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:
	These are a side that would be glad to have
	This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
	And show no sign of fear.
<SPEECH 105><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
	Nor I.
<SPEECH 106><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
	Pray let us go.
<SPEECH 107><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid
	In this so-never-needed help, yet do not
	Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you
	Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
	More than the instant army we can make,
	Might stop our countryman.
<SPEECH 108><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	Pray you, go to him.
<SPEECH 109><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	Yet your good will
	Must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure
	As you intended well.
<SPEECH 110><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	Not?
<SPEECH 111><ACT 5><SCENE 4><93%>
	Why, what of that?
<SPEECH 112><ACT 5><SCENE 4><93%>
	Is't possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man?
<SPEECH 113><ACT 5><SCENE 4><93%>
	He loved his mother dearly.
<SPEECH 114><ACT 5><SCENE 4><94%>
	Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.
<SPEECH 115><ACT 5><SCENE 4><94%>
	The gods be good unto us!
<SPEECH 116><ACT 5><SCENE 4><94%>
	What's the news?
<SPEECH 117><ACT 5><SCENE 4><94%>
	Friend,
	Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?
<SPEECH 118><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
	First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
	Accept my thankfulness.
<SPEECH 119><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
	They are near the city?
<SPEECH 120><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
	We will meet them,
	And help the joy.
