<SPEECH 1><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
	Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—
	Will they not hear? What ho! you men, you beasts,
	That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
	With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
	On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
	Throw your mis-temper'd weapons to the ground,
	And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
	Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
	By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
	Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
	And made Verona's ancient citizens
	Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
	To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
	Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate.
	If ever you disturb our streets again
	Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
	For this time, all the rest depart away:
	You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
	And, Montague, come you this afternoon
	To know our further pleasure in this case,
	To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
	Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

	Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
	Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	And for that offence
	Immediately we do exile him hence:
	I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
	My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
	But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
	That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
	I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
	Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses;
	Therefore use none; let Romeo hence in haste,
	Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
	Bear hence this body and attend our will:
	Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

	What misadventure is so early up,
	That calls our person from our morning's rest?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
	What fear is this which startles in our ears?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	Come, Montague: for thou art early up,
	To see thy son and heir more early down.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	Look, and thou shalt see.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
	Till we can clear these ambiguities,
	And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
	And then will I be general of your woes,
	And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
	And let mischance be slave to patience.
	Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 3><99%>
	We still have known thee for a holy man.
	Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 3><99%>
	Give me the letter; I will look on it.
	Where is the county's page that rais'd the watch?
	Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 3><99%>
	This letter doth make good the friar's words,
	Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
	And here he writes that he did buy a poison
	Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
	Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
	Where be these enemies?—Capulet! Montague!
	See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
	That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love;
	And I, for winking at your discords too,
	Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 3><100%>
	A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
	The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
	Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things:
	Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
	For never was a story of more woe
	Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
