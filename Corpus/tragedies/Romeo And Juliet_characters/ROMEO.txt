<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Ay me! sad hours seem long.
	Was that my father that went hence so fast?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Not having that, which having, makes them short.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Out—
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Out of her favour, where I am in love.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Alas! that love, whose view is muffled still,
	Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will.
	Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
	Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
	Here's much to do with hate, but more with love:
	Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
	O any thing! of nothing first create.
	O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
	Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
	Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
	Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
	This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
	Dost thou not laugh?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	Good heart, at what?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	Why, such is love's transgression.
	Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
	Which thou wilt propagate to have it press'd
	With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
	Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
	Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
	Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
	Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
	What is it else? a madness most discreet,
	A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
	Farewell, my coz.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here;
	This is not Romeo, he's some other where.

	What! shall I groan and tell thee?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	Bid a sick man in sadness make his will;

	In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
	With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
	And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
	From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
	She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
	Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
	Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
	O! she is rich in beauty; only poor
	That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
	For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
	Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
	She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
	To merit bliss by making me despair:
	She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
	Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	O! teach me how I should forget to think.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	'Tis the way
	To call hers exquisite, in question more.
	These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
	Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
	He, that is strucken blind cannot forget
	The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
	Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
	What doth her beauty serve but as a note
	Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
	Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.

	I am too sore enpierced with his shaft

	Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,

	O! she doth teach the torches to burn bright.

	Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear;
	Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
	So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
	As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
	The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
	And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
	Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!

<SPEECH 43><ACT 1><SCENE 5><22%>

	Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
	Who is already sick and pale with grief,
	That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
	Be not her maid, since she is envious;
	Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
	And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
	It is my lady; O! it is my love:
	O! that she knew she were.
	She speaks, yet she says nothing: what of that?
	Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
	I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
	Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
	Having some business, do entreat her eyes
	To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
	What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
	The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
	As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
	Would through the airy region stream so bright
	That birds would sing and think it were not night.
	See! how she leans her cheek upon her hand:
	O! that I were a glove upon that hand,
	That I might touch that cheek.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 2><SCENE 2><27%>
	She speaks:
	O! speak again, bright angel; for thou art
	As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,

	Of mortals, that fall back to gaze on him

	We met we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
	I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,

<SPEECH 83><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	Thou chidd'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

	What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
<SPEECH 107><ACT 2><SCENE 4><41%>

<SPEECH 108><ACT 2><SCENE 4><41%>
	Go to; I say, you shall.
<SPEECH 109><ACT 2><SCENE 4><41%>
	And stay, good nurse; behind the abbey wall:
	Within this hour my man shall be with thee,
	And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
	Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
	Must be my convoy in the secret night.
	Farewell! Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.
	Farewell! Commend me to thy mistress.
<SPEECH 110><ACT 2><SCENE 4><41%>
	What sayst thou, my dear nurse?
<SPEECH 111><ACT 2><SCENE 4><41%>

<SPEECH 114><ACT 2><SCENE 6><45%>
	Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
	It cannot countervail the exchange of joy

	It is enough I may but call her mine.
<SPEECH 115><ACT 2><SCENE 6><45%>
	Ah! Juliet, if the measure of thy joy

	Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
	Receive in either by this dear encounter.
<SPEECH 116><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
	Doth much excuse the appertaining rage

<SPEECH 117><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	I do protest I never injur'd thee,
	But love thee better than thou canst devise,

<SPEECH 120><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
<SPEECH 121><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	I thought all for the best.
<SPEECH 122><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	This gentleman, the prince's near ally,

	Thy beauty hath made me effeminate,
	And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
<SPEECH 123><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>

	Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again
	That late thou gav'st me; for Mercutio's soul
	Is but a little way above our heads,
	Staying for thine to keep him company:
	Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
<SPEECH 125><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>

	What less than doomsday is the prince's doom?
<SPEECH 129><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
	Ha! banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'

<SPEECH 130><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
	There is no world without Verona walls,
	But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
	Hence banished is banish'd from the world,
	And world's exile is death; then 'banished,'
	Is death mis-term'd. Calling death 'banished,'
	Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
	And smil'st upon the stroke that murders me.

	'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
	Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
	And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
	Live here in heaven and may look on her;
	But Romeo may not: more validity,
	More honourable state, more courtship lives
	In carrion flies than Romeo: they may seize
	On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand,
	And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
	Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
	Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
	Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
	They are free men, but I am banished.
	And sayst thou yet that exile is not death?
	Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
	No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
	But 'banished' to kill me? 'Banished!'
	O friar! the damned use that word in hell;
	Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
	Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
	A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
	To mangle me with that word 'banished?'
<SPEECH 132><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	O! thou wilt speak again of banishment.
<SPEECH 133><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	Yet 'banished!' Hang up philosophy!
	Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
	Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
	It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
<SPEECH 134><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
<SPEECH 135><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
	Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
	An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
	Doting like me, and like me banished,
	Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
	And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
	Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
<SPEECH 136><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	Not I; unless the breath of heart-sick groans,
	Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
<SPEECH 137><ACT 3><SCENE 3><60%>
	Nurse!
<SPEECH 138><ACT 3><SCENE 3><60%>
	Spak'st thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
	Doth she not think me an old murderer,
	Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy.
	With blood remov'd but little from her own?
	Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
	My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
<SPEECH 139><ACT 3><SCENE 3><60%>
	As if that name,
	Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
	Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
	Murder'd her kinsman. O! tell me, friar, tell me,
	In what vile part of this anatomy
	Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
	The hateful mansion.
<SPEECH 140><ACT 3><SCENE 3><62%>
	Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
<SPEECH 141><ACT 3><SCENE 3><62%>
	How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!
<SPEECH 142><ACT 3><SCENE 3><63%>
	But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
	It were a grief so brief to part with thee:
	Farewell.
<SPEECH 143><ACT 3><SCENE 5><64%>
	It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
	No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
	Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
	Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
	Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops:
	I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
<SPEECH 144><ACT 3><SCENE 5><64%>
	Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
	I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
	I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
	'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
	Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
	The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
	I have more care to stay than will to go:
	Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
	How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
<SPEECH 145><ACT 3><SCENE 5><65%>
	More light and light; more dark and dark our woes.
<SPEECH 146><ACT 3><SCENE 5><65%>
	Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
<SPEECH 147><ACT 3><SCENE 5><65%>
	Farewell!
	I will omit no opportunity
	That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
<SPEECH 148><ACT 3><SCENE 5><66%>
	I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
	For sweet discourses in our time to come.
<SPEECH 149><ACT 3><SCENE 5><66%>
	And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
	Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu! adieu!
<SPEECH 150><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
	My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
	My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
	And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
	Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
	I dreamt my lady came and found me dead;—
	Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think,—
	And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips,
	That I reviv'd, and was an emperor.
	Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
	When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
	News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?
	Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
	How doth my lady? Is my father well?
	How fares my Juliet? That I ask again;
	For nothing can be ill if she be well.
<SPEECH 151><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
	Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
	And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
<SPEECH 152><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	Tush, thou art deceiv'd;
	Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
	Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
<SPEECH 153><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	No matter; get thee gone,
	And hire those horses: I'll be with thee straight.
	Well, Juliet, I will he with thee to-night.
	Let's see for means: O mischief! thou art swift
	To enter in the thoughts of desperate men.
	I do remember an apothecary,
	And hereabouts he dwells, which late I noted
	In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
	Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
	Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
	And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
	An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
	Of ill-shap'd fishes; and about his shelves
	A beggarly account of empty boxes,
	Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
	Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses,
	Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
	Noting this penury, to myself I said
	An if a man did need a poison now,
	Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
	Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.
	O! this same thought did but fore-run my need,
	And this same needy man must sell it me.
	As I remember, this should be the house:
	Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
	What, ho! apothecary!
<SPEECH 154><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor;
	Hold, there is forty ducats; let me have
	A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
	As will disperse itself through all the veins
	That the life-weary taker may fall dead,
	And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
	As violently as hasty powder fir'd
	Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
<SPEECH 155><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	Art thou so bare, and full of wretchedness,
	And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
	Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
	Contempt and beggary hang upon thy back;
	The world is not thy friend nor the world's law:
	The world affords no law to make thee rich;
	Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
<SPEECH 156><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
<SPEECH 157><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
	Doing more murders in this loathsome world
	Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell:
	I sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.
	Farewell; buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
	Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
	To Juliet's grave, for there must I use thee.
<SPEECH 158><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	Give me that mattock, and the wrenching iron.
	Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
	See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
	Give me the light: upon thy life I charge thee,
	Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
	And do not interrupt me in my course.
	Why I descend into this bed of death,
	Is partly, to behold my lady's face;
	But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
	A precious ring, a ring that I must use
	In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
	But, if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
	In what I further shall intend to do,
	By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint,
	And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
	The time and my intents are savage-wild,
	More fierce and more inexorable far
	Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
<SPEECH 159><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
	Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.
<SPEECH 160><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
	Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,
	Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
	And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
<SPEECH 161><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	I must, indeed; and therefore came I hither.
	Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
	Fly hence and leave me: think upon these gone;
	Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
	Put not another sin upon my head
	By urging me to fury: O! be gone:
	By heaven, I love thee better than myself.
	For I come hither arm'd against myself:
	Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say
	A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
<SPEECH 162><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
	Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
<SPEECH 163><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
	In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face:
	Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
	What said my man when my betossed soul
	Did not attend him as we rode? I think
	He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
	Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
	Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
	To think it was so? O! give me thy hand,
	One writ with me in sour misfortune's book:
	I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
	A grave? O, no! a lanthorn, slaughter'd youth,
	For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
	This vault a feasting presence full of light.
	Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd,
	How oft when men are at the point of death
	Have they been merry! which their keepers call
	A lightning before death: O! how may I
	Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
	Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
	Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
	Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
	Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
	And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
	Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
	O! what more favour can I do to thee,
	Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
	To sunder his that was thine enemy?
	Forgive me, cousin! Ah! dear Juliet,
	Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
	That unsubstantial Death is amorous,
	And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
	Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
	For fear of that I still will stay with thee,
	And never from this palace of dim night
	Depart again: here, here will I remain
	With worms that are thy chambermaids; O! here
	Will I set up my everlasting rest,
	And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
	From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
	Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
	The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
	A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
	Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
	Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
	The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
	Here's to my love! <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> O true apothecary!
	Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
