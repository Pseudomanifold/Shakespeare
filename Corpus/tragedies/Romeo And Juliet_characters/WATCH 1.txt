	</STAGE DIR> Lead, boy: which way?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 5><SCENE 3><95%>
	The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard.
	Go, some of you; whoe'er you find, attach.
	Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
	And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
	Who here hath lain these two days buried.
	Go, tell the prince, run to the Capulets,
	Raise up the Montagues, some others search:
	We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
	But the true ground of all these piteous woes
	We cannot without circumstance descry.

	A great suspicion: stay the friar too.

	Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
	And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
	Warm and new kill'd.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
	With instruments upon them, fit to open
	These dead men's tombs.
