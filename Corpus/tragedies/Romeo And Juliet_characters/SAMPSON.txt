	Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	I strike quickly, being moved.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids; I will cut off their heads.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense thou wilt.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	My naked weapon is out; quarrel, I will back thee.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Fear me not.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	I do bite my thumb, sir.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	</STAGE DIR> Is the law of our side if I say ay?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Well, sir.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Yes, better, sir.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
