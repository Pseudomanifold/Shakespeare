	A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
	Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
	This is the matter. Nurse, give leave awhile.
	We must talk in secret: nurse, come back again;
	I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
	Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
	She's not fourteen.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 3><13%>
	A fortnight and odd days.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
	I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
	How stands your disposition to be married?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
	Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
	Are made already mothers: by my count,
	I was your mother much upon these years
	That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief,
	The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	What say you? can you love the gentleman?
	This night you shall behold him at our feast;
	Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face
	And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
	Examine every married lineament,
	And see how one another lends content;
	And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
	Find written in the margent of his eyes.
	This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
	To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
	The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
	For fair without the fair within to hide:
	That book in many eyes doth share the glory,
	That in gold clasps locks in the golden story:
	So shall you share all that he doth possess,
	By having him making yourself no less.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	We follow thee. Juliet, the county stays.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
	O prince! O cousin! husband! O! the blood is spill'd
	Of my dear kinsman. Prince, as thou art true,
	For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
	O cousin, cousin!
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	He is a kinsman to the Montague;
	Affection makes him false, he speaks not true:
	Some twenty of them fought in this black strife
	And all those twenty could but kill one life.
	I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
	Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 4><63%>
	I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
	To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 5><66%>
	</STAGE DIR> Ho, daughter! are you up?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 5><66%>
	Why, how now, Juliet!
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 5><66%>
	Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
	What! wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
	And if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
	Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
	But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 5><66%>
	So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
	Which you weep for.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 5><66%>
	Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
	As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 5><67%>
	That same villain, Romeo.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 5><67%>
	That is because the traitor murderer lives.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 5><67%>
	We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
	Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
	Where that same banish'd runsgate doth live;
	Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
	That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
	And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 5><67%>
	Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
	But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 5><67%>
	Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
	One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
	Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
	That thou expect'st not, nor I look'd not for.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 5><68%>
	Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
	The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
	The County Paris, at Saint Peter's church,
	Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 5><68%>
	Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
	And see how he will take it at your hands.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 5><68%>
	Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
	I would the fool were married to her grave!
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 5><69%>
	Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 5><70%>
	You are too hot.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 5><70%>
	Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.
	Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
	No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
	We shall be short in our provision:
	'Tis now near night.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	What! are you busy, ho? need you my help?
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	Good-night:
	Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>
	Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>
	Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
	But I will watch you from such watching now.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 5><81%>
	What noise is here?
<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 5><81%>
	What is the matter?
<SPEECH 40><ACT 4><SCENE 5><81%>
	O me, O me! my child, my only life,
	Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
	Help, help! Call help.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 4><SCENE 5><82%>
	Alack the day! she's dead, she's dead! she's dead!
<SPEECH 42><ACT 4><SCENE 5><82%>
	O woeful time!
<SPEECH 43><ACT 4><SCENE 5><82%>
	Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful-day!
	Most miserable hour, that e'er time saw
	In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
	But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
	But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
	And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
	The people in the street cry Romeo,
	Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run
	With open outcry toward our monument.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
	That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
