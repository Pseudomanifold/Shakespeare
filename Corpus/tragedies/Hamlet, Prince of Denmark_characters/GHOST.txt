	My hour is almost come,

	Must render up myself.

	So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 5><18%>
	I am thy father's spirit;
	Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
	And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
	Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
	Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
	To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
	I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
	Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
	Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
	Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
	And each particular hair to stand an end,
	Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
	But this eternal blazon must not be
	To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O list!
	If thou didst ever thy dear father love—
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 5><18%>
	Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 5><18%>
	Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
	But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 5><18%>
	I find thee apt;
	And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
	That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
	Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
	'Tis given out that, sleeping in mine orchard,
	A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
	Is by a forged process of my death
	Rankly abus'd; but know, thou noble youth,
	The serpent that did sting thy father's life
	Now wears his crown.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 5><18%>
	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
	With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,—
	O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
	So to seduce!—won to his shameful lust
	The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
	O Hamlet! what a falling-off was there;
	From me, whose love was of that dignity
	That it went hand in hand even with the vow
	I made to her in marriage; and to decline
	Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
	To those of mine!
	But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
	Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
	So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
	Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
	And prey on garbage.
	But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
	Brief let me be. Sleeping within mine orchard,
	My custom always in the afternoon,
	Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
	With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
	And in the porches of mine ears did pour
	The leperous distilment; whose effect
	Holds such an enmity with blood of man
	That swift as quicksilver it courses through
	The natural gates and alleys of the body,
	And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
	And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
	The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
	And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
	Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
	All my smooth body.
	Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand,
	Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
	Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
	Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
	No reckoning made, but sent to my account
	With all my imperfections on my head:
	O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
	If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
	Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
	A couch for luxury and damned incest.
	But, howsoever thou pursu'st this act,
	Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
	Against thy mother aught; leave her to heaven,
	And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
	To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
	The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
	And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire;
	Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.

	Do not forget: this visitation

	But, look! amazement on thy mother sits;
	O! step between her and her fighting soul;
	Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
	Speak to her, Hamlet.
