	Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;
	Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras
	Claims the conveyance of a promis'd march
	Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
	If that his majesty would aught with us,
	We shall express our duty in his eye,
	And let him know so.

	Go softly on.

	Where is this sight?

	This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death!
	What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
	That thou so many princes at a shot
	So bloodily hast struck?

	Let us haste to hear it,
	And call the noblest to the audience.
	For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune;
	I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
	Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.

	Let four captains
	Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
	For he was likely, had he been put on,
	To have prov'd most royally: and, for his passage,
	The soldiers' music and the rites of war
	Speak loudly for him.
	Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
	Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
	Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
