	O! farewell, honest soldier:
	Who hath reliev'd you?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	Holla! Bernardo!
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	What! has this thing appear'd again to-night?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
	And will not let belief take hold of him
	Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us:
	Therefore I have entreated him along
	With us to watch the minutes of this night;
	That if again this apparition come,
	He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	Peace! break thee off; look, where it comes again!
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	Question it, Horatio.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	It is offended.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	'Tis gone, and will not answer.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Is it not like the king?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
	With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
	Why this same strict and most observant watch
	So nightly toils the subject of the land;
	And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
	And foreign mart for implements of war;
	Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
	Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
	What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
	Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
	Who is 't that can inform me?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	'Tis gone!
	We do it wrong, being so majestical,
	To offer it the show of violence;
	For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
	And our vain blows malicious mockery.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	It faded on the crowing of the cock.
	Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
	Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
	The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
	And then, they say, no spirit can walk abroad;
	The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
	No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
	So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.

	Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
	Where we shall find him most conveniently.

	My good lord,â€”
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	We do, my lord.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	Arm'd, my lord.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	My lord, from head to foot.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	Longer, longer.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 4><15%>
	No, it is struck.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 4><16%>
	Look, with what courteous action
	It waves you to a more removed ground:
	But do not go with it.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 4><17%>
	You shall not go, my lord.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 4><17%>
	Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 1><SCENE 4><17%>
	Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 1><SCENE 4><17%>
	Nay, let's follow him.

	</STAGE DIR> Lord Hamlet!
<SPEECH 31><ACT 1><SCENE 5><20%>
	</STAGE DIR> So be it!
<SPEECH 32><ACT 1><SCENE 5><20%>
	How is't, my noble lord?
<SPEECH 33><ACT 1><SCENE 5><20%>
	Nor I, my lord.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 1><SCENE 5><20%>
	Ay, by heaven, my lord.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 1><SCENE 5><21%>
	My lord, we will not.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 1><SCENE 5><21%>
	Nor I, my lord, in faith.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 1><SCENE 5><21%>
	We have sworn, my lord, already.
