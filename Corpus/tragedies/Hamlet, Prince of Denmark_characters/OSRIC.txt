	Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his majesty.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	I thank your lordship, 'tis very hot.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere, I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter,—
<SPEECH 6><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing; indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	Sir?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	Of Laertes?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	I know you are not ignorant—
<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is—
<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	Rapier and dagger.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary horses; against the which he has imponed, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial, if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	Shall I re-deliver you so?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	I commend my duty to your lordship.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
	Ay, my good lord.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
	A hit, a very palpable hit.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
	Nothing, neither way.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
	Look to the queen there, ho!
<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
	How is it, Laertes?
<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 2><99%>
	Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
	To the ambassadors of England gives
	This war-like volley.
