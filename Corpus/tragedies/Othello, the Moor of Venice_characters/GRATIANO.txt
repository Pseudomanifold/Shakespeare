	Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.

	Cassio!

	Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead.
	Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief
	Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,
	This sight would make him do a desperate turn,
	Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
	And fall to reprobation.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	Fie!
	Your sword upon a woman?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
	The woman falls: sure, he has kill'd his wife.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
	He's gone; but his wife's kill'd.

	</STAGE DIR> If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear:
	Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
	What is the matter?
<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
	Torments will ope your lips.

	All that's spoke is marr'd.
