	My noble father,
	I do perceive here a divided duty:
	To you I am bound for life and education;
	My life and education both do learn me
	How to respect you; you are the lord of duty,
	I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband;
	And so much duty as my mother show'd
	To you, preferring you before her father,
	So much I challenge that I may profess
	Due to the Moor my lord.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	Nor I; I would not there reside,
	To put my father in impatient thoughts
	By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,
	To my unfolding lend your gracious ear;
	And let me find a charter in your voice
	To assist my simpleness.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	That I did love the Moor to live with him,
	My downright violence and storm of fortunes
	May trumpet to the world; my heart's subdu'd
	Even to the very quality of my lord;
	I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
	And to his honours and his valiant parts
	Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
	So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
	A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
	The rites for which I love him are bereft me,
	And I a heavy interim shall support
	By his dear absence. Let me go with him.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	I thank you, valiant Cassio.
	What tidings can you tell me of my lord?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	O! but I fear—How lost you company?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Alas! she has no speech.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	O! fie upon thee, slanderer.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise me?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	Come on; assay. There's one gone to the harbour?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	I am not merry, but I do beguile
	The thing I am by seeming otherwise.
	Come, how wouldst thou praise me?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	Well prais'd! How if she be black and witty?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	Worse and worse.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul and foolish?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best. But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	To do what?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	Let's meet him and receive him.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	My dear Othello!
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	The heavens forbid
	But that our loves and comforts should increase
	Even as our days do grow!
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	What's the matter?
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 3><45%>
	Be thou assur'd, good Cassio, I will do
	All my abilities in thy behalf.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 3><45%>
	O! that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,
	But I will have my lord and you again
	As friendly as you were.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 3><45%>
	I know 't; I thank you. You do love my lord;
	You have known him long; and be you well assur'd
	He shall in strangeness stand no further off
	Than in a politic distance.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 3><45%>
	Do not doubt that; before Emilia here
	I give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,
	If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
	To the last article; my lord shall never rest;
	I'll watch him tame, and talk him out of patience;
	His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
	I'll intermingle every thing he does
	With Cassio's suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio;
	For thy solicitor shall rather die
	Than give thy cause away.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 3><45%>
	Why, stay, and hear me speak.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 3><45%>
	Well, do your discretion.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 3><46%>
	How now, my lord!
	I have been talking with a suitor here,
	A man that languishes in your displeasure.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 3><46%>
	Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
	If I have any grace or power to move you,
	His present reconciliation take;
	For if he be not one that truly loves you,
	That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,
	I have no judgment in an honest face.
	I prithee call him back.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 3><46%>
	Ay, sooth; so humbled,
	That he hath left part of his grief with me,
	To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 3><46%>
	But shall 't be shortly?
<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 3><46%>
	Shall 't be to-night at supper?
<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 3><46%>
	To-morrow dinner then?
<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 3><46%>
	Why then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;
	On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
	I prithee name the time, but let it not
	Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;
	And yet his trespass, in our common reason,—
	Save that they say, the wars must make examples
	Out of their best,—is not almost a fault
	To incur a private check. When shall he come?
	Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,
	What you could ask me that I should deny,
	Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,
	That came a wooing with you, and so many a time,
	When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,
	Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do
	To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much.—
<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 3><47%>
	Why, this is not a boon;
	'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
	Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
	Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
	To your own person; nay, when I have a suit
	Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
	It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,
	And fearful to be granted.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 3><SCENE 3><47%>
	Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 3><SCENE 3><47%>
	Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;
	Whate'er you be, I am obedient.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 3><SCENE 3><53%>
	How now, my dear Othello!
	Your dinner and the generous islanders
	By you invited, do attend your presence.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 3><53%>
	Why do you speak so faintly?
	Are you not well?
<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 3><53%>
	Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:
	Let me but bind it hard, within this hour
	It will be well.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 3><53%>
	I am very sorry that you are not well.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
	Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
<SPEECH 42><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
	Why, man?
<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
	Go to; where lodges he?
<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
	Can anything be made of this?
<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
	Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?
<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
	Seek him, bid him come hither; tell him I have moved my lord in his behalf, and hope all will be well.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
	Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
<SPEECH 48><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
	Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
	Full of cruzadoes; and, but my noble Moor
	Is true of mind, and made of no such baseness
	As jealous creatures are, it were enough
	To put him to ill thinking.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
	Who! he? I think the sun where he was born
	Drew all such humours from him.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
	I will not leave him now till Cassio
	Be call'd to him.
	How is 't with you, my lord?
<SPEECH 51><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
	Well, my good lord.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
	It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
	You may, indeed, say so;
	For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
	I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
	I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
	Here, my lord.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
	I have it not about me.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
	No, indeed, my lord.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 3><SCENE 4><61%>
	Is 't possible?
<SPEECH 60><ACT 3><SCENE 4><61%>
	Indeed! is 't true?
<SPEECH 61><ACT 3><SCENE 4><61%>
	Then would to heaven that I had never seen it!
<SPEECH 62><ACT 3><SCENE 4><61%>
	Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
<SPEECH 63><ACT 3><SCENE 4><61%>
	Heaven bless us!
<SPEECH 64><ACT 3><SCENE 4><61%>
	It is not lost: but what an if it were?
<SPEECH 65><ACT 3><SCENE 4><61%>
	I say, it is not lost.
<SPEECH 66><ACT 3><SCENE 4><61%>
	Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
	This is a trick to put me from my suit:
	Pray you let Cassio be receiv'd again.
<SPEECH 67><ACT 3><SCENE 4><61%>
	Come, come;
	You'll never meet a more sufficient man.
<SPEECH 68><ACT 3><SCENE 4><61%>
	I pray, talk me of Cassio.
<SPEECH 69><ACT 3><SCENE 4><61%>
	A man that all his time
	Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,
	Shar'd dangers with you,—
<SPEECH 70><ACT 3><SCENE 4><62%>
	In sooth you are to blame.
<SPEECH 71><ACT 3><SCENE 4><62%>
	I ne'er saw this before.
	Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief;
	I am most unhappy in the loss of it.
<SPEECH 72><ACT 3><SCENE 4><62%>
	How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?
<SPEECH 73><ACT 3><SCENE 4><62%>
	Alas! thrice-gentle Cassio!
	My advocation is not now in tune;
	My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,
	Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.
	So help me every spirit sanctified,
	As I have spoken for you all my best
	And stood within the blank of his displeasure
	For my free speech. You must awhile be patient;
	What I can do I will, and more I will
	Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.
<SPEECH 74><ACT 3><SCENE 4><63%>
	I prithee, do so. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Something, sure, of state,
	Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practice
	Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,
	Hath puddled his clear spirit; and, in such cases
	Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,
	Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;
	For let our finger ache, and it indues
	Our other healthful members ev'n to that sense
	Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,
	Nor of them look for such observancy
	As fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,
	I was—unhandsome warrior as I am—
	Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
	But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,
	And he's indicted falsely.
<SPEECH 75><ACT 3><SCENE 4><63%>
	Alas the day! I never gave him cause.
<SPEECH 76><ACT 3><SCENE 4><63%>
	Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!
<SPEECH 77><ACT 3><SCENE 4><63%>
	I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout;
	If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit
	And seek to effect it to my uttermost.
<SPEECH 78><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?
<SPEECH 79><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord
	An unkind breach; but you shall make all well.
<SPEECH 80><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	My lord?
<SPEECH 81><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	A most unhappy one; I would do much
	To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.
<SPEECH 82><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	My lord?
<SPEECH 83><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	What! is he angry?
<SPEECH 84><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	Trust me, I am glad on 't.
<SPEECH 85><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	My lord?
<SPEECH 86><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	Why, sweet Othello?
<SPEECH 87><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	I have not deserved this.
<SPEECH 88><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	I will not stay to offend you.
<SPEECH 89><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	My lord?
<SPEECH 90><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
	My lord, what is your will?
<SPEECH 91><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
	What is your pleasure?
<SPEECH 92><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
	What horrible fancy's this?
<SPEECH 93><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
	Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
	I understand a fury in your words,
	But not the words.
<SPEECH 94><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
	Your wife, my lord; your true
	And loyal wife.
<SPEECH 95><ACT 4><SCENE 2><75%>
	Heaven doth truly know it.
<SPEECH 96><ACT 4><SCENE 2><75%>
	To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?
<SPEECH 97><ACT 4><SCENE 2><75%>
	Alas, the heavy day!—Why do you weep?
	Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
	If haply you my father do suspect
	An instrument of this your calling back,
	Lay not your blame on me; if you have lost him,
	Why, I have lost him too.
<SPEECH 98><ACT 4><SCENE 2><75%>
	I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.
<SPEECH 99><ACT 4><SCENE 2><75%>
	Alas! what ignorant sin have I committed?
<SPEECH 100><ACT 4><SCENE 2><76%>
	By heaven, you do me wrong.
<SPEECH 101><ACT 4><SCENE 2><76%>
	No, as I am a Christian.
	If to preserve this vessel for my lord
	From any other foul unlawful touch
	Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.
<SPEECH 102><ACT 4><SCENE 2><76%>
	No, as I shall be sav'd.
<SPEECH 103><ACT 4><SCENE 2><76%>
	O! heaven forgive us.
<SPEECH 104><ACT 4><SCENE 2><76%>
	Faith, half asleep.
<SPEECH 105><ACT 4><SCENE 2><76%>
	With who?
<SPEECH 106><ACT 4><SCENE 2><76%>
	Who is thy lord?
<SPEECH 107><ACT 4><SCENE 2><76%>
	I have none; do not talk to me, Emilia;
	I cannot weep, nor answer have I none,
	But what should go by water. Prithee, to-night
	Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember:
	And call thy husband hither.
<SPEECH 108><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
	'Tis meet I should be us'd so, very meet.
	How have I been behav'd, that he might stick
	The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
<SPEECH 109><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
	I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
	Do it with gentle means and easy tasks;
	He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,
	I am a child to chiding.
<SPEECH 110><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
	Am I that name, Iago?
<SPEECH 111><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
	Such as she says my lord did say I was.
<SPEECH 112><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
	I do not know; I am sure I am none such.
<SPEECH 113><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
	It is my wretched fortune.
<SPEECH 114><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
	Nay, heaven doth know.
<SPEECH 115><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
	If any such there be, heaven pardon him!
<SPEECH 116><ACT 4><SCENE 2><78%>
	O good Iago,
	What shall I do to win my lord again?
	Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,
	I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:
	If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,
	Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,
	Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,
	Delighted them in any other form;
	Or that I do not yet, and ever did,
	And ever will, though he do shake me off
	To beggarly divorcement, love him dearly,
	Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;
	And his unkindness may defeat my life,
	But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'
	It does abhor me now I speak the word;
	To do the act that might the addition earn
	Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.
<SPEECH 117><ACT 4><SCENE 2><78%>
	If 'twere no other,—
<SPEECH 118><ACT 4><SCENE 3><81%>
	Your honour is most welcome.
<SPEECH 119><ACT 4><SCENE 3><81%>
	My lord?
<SPEECH 120><ACT 4><SCENE 3><81%>
	I will, my lord.
<SPEECH 121><ACT 4><SCENE 3><81%>
	He says he will return incontinent;
	He hath commanded me to go to bed,
	And bade me to dismiss you.
<SPEECH 122><ACT 4><SCENE 3><81%>
	It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,
	Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:
	We must not now displease him.
<SPEECH 123><ACT 4><SCENE 3><81%>
	So would not I; my love doth so approve him,
	That even his stubbornness, his checks and frowns,—
	Prithee, unpin me,—have grace and favour in them.
<SPEECH 124><ACT 4><SCENE 3><82%>
	All's one. Good faith! how foolish are our minds!
	If I do die before thee, prithee, shroud me
	In one of those same sheets.
<SPEECH 125><ACT 4><SCENE 3><82%>
	My mother had a maid call'd Barbara;
	She was in love, and he she lov'd prov'd mad
	And did forsake her; she had a song of 'willow;'
	An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,
	And she died singing it; that song to-night
	Will not go from my mind; I have much to do
	But to go hang my head all at one side,
	And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.
<SPEECH 126><ACT 4><SCENE 3><82%>
	No, unpin me here.
	This Lodovico is a proper man.
<SPEECH 127><ACT 4><SCENE 3><82%>
	He speaks well.
<SPEECH 128><ACT 4><SCENE 3><82%>
	The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,
	Sing all a green willow;
	Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,
	Sing willow, willow, willow:
	The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;
	Sing willow, willow, willow:
	Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;—
	Lay by these:—
	Sing willow, willow, willow:
	Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon.—
	Sing all a green willow must be my garland.
	Let nobody blame him, his scorn I approve,—
	Nay, that's not next. Hark! who is it that knocks?
<SPEECH 129><ACT 4><SCENE 3><82%>
	I call'd my love false love; but what said he then?
	Sing willow, willow, willow:
	If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men.
	So, get thee gone; good night. Mine eyes do itch;
	Doth that bode weeping?
<SPEECH 130><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
	I have heard it said so. O! these men, these men!
	Dost thou in conscience think, tell me, Emilia,
	That there be women do abuse their husbands
	In such gross kind?
<SPEECH 131><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
	Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
<SPEECH 132><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
	No, by this heavenly light!
<SPEECH 133><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
	Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
<SPEECH 134><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
	In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
<SPEECH 135><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
	Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
	For the whole world.
<SPEECH 136><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
	I do not think there is any such woman.
<SPEECH 137><ACT 4><SCENE 3><84%>
	Good night, good night; heaven me such usage send,
	Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!
<SPEECH 138><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	Who's there? Othello?
<SPEECH 139><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	Will you come to bed, my lord?
<SPEECH 140><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	Ay, my lord.
<SPEECH 141><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	Alas! my lord, what may you mean by that?
<SPEECH 142><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	Talk you of killing?
<SPEECH 143><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	Then heaven
	Have mercy on me!
<SPEECH 144><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.
<SPEECH 145><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then
	When your eyes roll so. Why I should fear I know not,
	Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.
<SPEECH 146><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	They are loves I bear to you.
<SPEECH 147><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
	Alas! why gnaw you so your nether lip?
	Some bloody passion shakes your very frame;
	These are portents, but yet, I hope, I hope
	They do not point on me.
<SPEECH 148><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	I will so. What's the matter?
<SPEECH 149><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	No, by my life and soul!
	Send for the man and ask him.
<SPEECH 150><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	Ay, but not yet to die.
<SPEECH 151><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	Then Lord have mercy on me!
<SPEECH 152><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	And have you mercy too! I never did
	Offend you in my life; never lov'd Cassio
	But with such general warranty of heaven
	As I might love; I never gave him token.
<SPEECH 153><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	He found it then;
	I never gave it him. Send for him hither;
	Let him confess a truth.
<SPEECH 154><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	What, my lord?
<SPEECH 155><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	How? unlawfully?
<SPEECH 156><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	He will not say so.
<SPEECH 157><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	O! my fear interprets. What! is he dead?
<SPEECH 158><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.
<SPEECH 159><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	O! banish me, my lord, but kill me not!
<SPEECH 160><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	Kill me to-morrow; let me live to-night!
<SPEECH 161><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	But half an hour!
<SPEECH 162><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	But while I say one prayer!
<SPEECH 163><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	O! falsely, falsely murder'd.
<SPEECH 164><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	A guiltless death I die.
<SPEECH 165><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	Nobody; I myself; farewell:
	Commend me to my kind lord. O! farewell!
