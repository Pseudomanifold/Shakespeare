	Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><34%>
	I am not sick if Brutus have in hand
	Any exploit worthy the name of honour.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><35%>
	By all the gods that Romans bow before
	I here discard my sickness. Soul of Rome!
	Brave son, deriv'd from honourable loins!
	Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjur'd up
	My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,
	And I will strive with things impossible;
	Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><35%>
	But are not some whole that we must make sick?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><35%>
	Set on your foot,
	And with a heart new-fir'd I follow you,
	To do I know not what; but it sufficeth
	That Brutus leads me on.
