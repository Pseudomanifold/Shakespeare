	Here, my lord.

	What mean you, Cæsar? Think you to walk forth?
	You shall not stir out of your house to-day.

	Cæsar, I never stood on ceremonies,
	Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
	Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
	Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
	A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
	And graves have yawn'd and yielded up their dead;
	Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,
	In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
	Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;
	The noise of battle hurtled in the air,
	Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,
	And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
	O Cæsar! these things are beyond all use,
	And I do fear them.

	When beggars die there are no comets seen;
	The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.

	Alas! my lord,
	Your wisdom is consum'd in confidence.
	Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear
	That keeps you in the house, and not your own.
	We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house,
	And he shall say you are not well to-day:
	Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.

	Say he is sick.
