	Good-night, Lord Brutus.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	O Cassius! Brutus gave the word too early;
	Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
	Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,
	Whilst we by Antony are all enclos'd.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	They are, my lord.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	I will be here again, even with a thought.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
	These tidings will well comfort Cassius.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
	All disconsolate,
	With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
	He lies not like the living. O my heart!
<SPEECH 8><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
	No, this was he, Messala,
	But Cassius is no more. O setting sun!
	As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,
	So in his red blood Cassius' day is set;
	The sun of Rome is set. Our day is gone;
	Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done.
	Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
	What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
	Hie you, Messala,
	And I will seek for Pindarus the while.
	Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
	Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they
	Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
	And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
	Alas! thou hast misconstru'd every thing.
	But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
	Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
	Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
	And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
	By your leave, gods: this is a Roman's part:
	Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
