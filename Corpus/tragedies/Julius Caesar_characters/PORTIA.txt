	Brutus, my lord!
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><31%>
	Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,
	Stole from my bed; and yesternight at supper
	You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,
	Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
	And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
	You star'd upon me with ungentle looks.
	I urg'd you further; then you scratch'd your head,
	And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;
	Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
	But, with an angry wafture of your hand.
	Gave sign for me to leave you. So I did,
	Fearing to strengthen that impatience
	Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal
	Hoping it was but an effect of humour,
	Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
	It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
	And could it work so much upon your shape
	As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
	I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,
	Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><32%>
	Brutus is wise, and were he not in health,
	He would embrace the means to come by it.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><32%>
	Is Brutus sick, and is it physical
	To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
	Of the dank morning? What! is Brutus sick,
	And will he steal out of his wholesome bed
	To dare the vile contagion of the night,
	And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
	To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;
	You have some sick offence within your mind,
	Which, by the right and virtue of my place,
	I ought to know of; and, upon my knees,
	I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,
	By all your vows of love, and that great vow
	Which did incorporate and make us one,
	That you unfold to me, your self, your half,
	Why are you heavy, and what men to-night
	Have had resort to you; for here have been
	Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
	Even from darkness.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>
	I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
	Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
	Is it excepted, I should know no secrets
	That appertain to you? Am I yourself
	But, as it were, in sort of limitation,
	To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
	And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
	Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
	Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>
	If this were true then should I know this secret.
	I grant I am a woman, but, withal,
	A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife;
	I grant I am a woman, but, withal,
	A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.
	Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
	Being so father'd and so husbanded?
	Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em.
	I have made strong proof of my constancy,
	Giving myself a voluntary wound
	Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience
	And not my husband's secrets?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 4><41%>
	I prithee, boy, run to the senate-house;
	Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.
	Why dost thou stay?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 4><41%>
	I would have had thee there, and here again,
	Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
	O constancy! be strong upon my side;
	Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue;
	I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
	How hard it is for women to keep counsel!
	Art thou here yet?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 4><42%>
	Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
	For he went sickly forth; and take good note
	What Cæsar doth, what suitors press to him.
	Hark, boy! what noise is that?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 4><42%>
	Prithee, listen well:
	I heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,
	And the wind brings it from the Capitol.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 4><42%>
	Come hither, fellow: which way hast thou been?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 4><42%>
	What is 't o'clock?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 4><42%>
	Is Cæsar yet gone to the Capitol?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 4><42%>
	Thou hast some suit to Cæsar, hast thou not?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 4><43%>
	Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 4><43%>
	I must go in. Ay me! how weak a thing
	The heart of woman is. O Brutus!
	The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise.
	Sure, the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suit
	That Cæsar will not grant. O! I grow faint.
	Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
	Say I am merry: come to me again,
	And bring me word what he doth say to thee.
