	I will, my lord.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
	Searching the window for a flint, I found
	This paper, thus seal'd up; and I am sure
	It did not lie there when I went to bed.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	I know not, sir.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	I will, sir.

	Sir, March is wasted fourteen days.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,

<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	No, sir, there are more with him.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
	And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
	That by no means I may discover them
	By any mark of favour.

<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 4><42%>
	Madam, what shall I do?
	Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
	And so return to you, and nothing else?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 4><42%>
	I hear none, madam.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 4><42%>
	Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 3><82%>
	Here in the tent.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 3><82%>
	Varro! and Claudius!
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 3><82%>
	I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
	Ay, my lord, an 't please you.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
	It is my duty, sir.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
	I have slept, my lord, already.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 3><84%>
	The strings, my lord, are false.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 3><84%>
	My lord!
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 3><84%>
	My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 3><84%>
	Nothing, my lord.
