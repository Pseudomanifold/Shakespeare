	By all description this should be the place.
	Who's here? speak, ho! No answer! What is this?
	Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span:
	Some beast rear'd this; here does not live a man.
	Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb
	I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax:
	Our captain hath in every figure skill;
	An ag'd interpreter, though young in days.
	Before proud Athens he's set down by this,
	Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 5><SCENE 4><99%>
	My noble general, Timon is dead;
	Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea:
	And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which
	With wax I brought away, whose soft impression
	Interprets for my poor ignorance.
