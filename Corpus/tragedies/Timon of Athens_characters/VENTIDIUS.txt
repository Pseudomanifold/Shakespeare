	Most honour'd Timon,
	It hath pleas'd the gods to remember my father's age,
	And call him to long peace.
	He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
	Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound
	To your free heart, I do return those talents,
	Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help
	I deriv'd liberty.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
	A noble spirit.
