	Noble Ventidius! Well;

	A gentleman that well deserves a help,
	Which he shall have: I'll pay the debt and free him.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	Commend me to him. I will send his ransom;

<SPEECH 38><ACT 1><SCENE 1><11%>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
	O! by no means,

	To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
	Nay, my lords, ceremony was but devis'd at first
	To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,

	Nor is he fit for it, indeed.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 1><SCENE 2><14%>
	I take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian, therefore, welcome. I myself would have no power; prithee, let my meat make thee silent.

<SPEECH 47><ACT 1><SCENE 2><16%>
	O! no doubt, my good friends, but the gods themselves have provided that I shall have much help from you: how had you been my friends else? why have you that charitable title from thousands, did not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm you. O you gods! think I, what need we have any friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they were the most needless creatures living should we ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases, that keep their sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished myself poorer that I might come nearer to you. We are born to do benefits; and what better or properer can we call our own than the riches of our friends? O! what a precious comfort 'tis, to have so many, like brothers, commanding one another's fortunes. O joy! e'en made away ere it can be born. Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to forget their faults, I drink to you.

	You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,
	Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,

<SPEECH 59><ACT 1><SCENE 2><21%>

<SPEECH 60><ACT 1><SCENE 2><21%>

<SPEECH 61><ACT 1><SCENE 2><22%>
	You do yourselves

	Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 1><SCENE 2><22%>
	And now I remember, my lord, you gave
	Good words the other day of a bay courser
	I rode on: it is yours, because you lik'd it.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 1><SCENE 2><22%>
	You may take my word, my lord; I know no man
	Can justly praise but what he does affect:
	I weigh my friend's affection with mine own;
	I'll tell you true. I'll call to you.
<SPEECH 64><ACT 1><SCENE 2><22%>
	I take all and your several visitations
	So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;
	Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,

	It comes in charity to thee; for all thy living
	Is 'mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast
	Lie in a pitch'd field.
<SPEECH 65><ACT 1><SCENE 2><22%>
	And so

	Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I am sworn not to give regard to you. Farewell; and come with better music.

	Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack,

	If I would broach the vessels of my love,
	And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,
	Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use
	As I can bid thee speak.

	And, in some sort, these wants of mine are crown'd,

	Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to the lip of his mistress; your diet shall be in all places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place: sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.—
	You great benefactors sprinkle our society with thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves praised: but reserve still to give, lest your deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that one need not lend to another; for, were your godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at the table, let a dozen of them be as they are. The rest of your fees, O gods! the senators of Athens, together with the common lag of people, what is amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for destruction. For these my present friends, as they are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to nothing are they welcome.

	Your reeking villany. Live loath'd, and long,
	Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,
	Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,
	You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time's flies,
	Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-jacks!

	Soft! take thy physic first,—thou too,—and thou;—

	Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,

	Convert, o'the instant, green virginity!
	Do't in your parents' eyes! Bankrupts, hold fast;
	Rather than render back, out with your knives,
	And cut your trusters' throats! Bound servants, steal!—
	Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,—
	And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed;
	Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen,
	Pluck the lin'd crutch from thy old limping sire,
	With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear,
	Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,
	Domestic awe, night-rest and neighbourhood,
	Instruction, manners, mysteries and trades,
	Degrees, observances, customs and laws,
	Decline to your confounding contraries,
	And let confusion live! Plagues incident to men,
	Your potent and infectious fevers heap
	On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,
	Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt
	As lamely as their manners! Lust and liberty
	Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,
	That'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,
	And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,
	Sow all the Athenian bosoms, and their crop
	Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,
	That their society, as their friendship, may
	Be merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee
	But nakedness, thou detestable town!
	Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!
	Timon will to the woods; where he shall find
	The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.
	The gods confound—hear me, you good gods all—
	The Athenians both within and out that wall!

	O blessed breeding sun! draw from the earth

	The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,

	Raise me this beggar, and deny't that lord;

	The beggar native honour.
	It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,

	In purity of manhood stand upright,
	And say, 'This man's a flatterer?' if one be,
	So are they all; for every grize of fortune
	Is smooth'd by that below: the learned pate
	Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;
	There's nothing level in our cursed natures

	Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,
	Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.
	Ha! you gods, why this? What this, you gods? Why, this

	Not by his breath that is more miserable.
	Thou art a slave, whom Fortune's tender arm

	Hadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceeded
	The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
	To such as may the passive drudges of it
	Freely command, thou wouldst have plung'd thyself
	In general riot; melted down thy youth
	In different beds of lust; and never learn'd
	The icy precepts of respect, but follow'd
	The sugar'd game before thee. But myself,
	Who had the world as my confectionary,
	The mouths, the tongues, the eyes, and hearts of men
	At duty, more than I could frame employment,
	That numberless upon me stuck as leaves
	Do on the oak, have with one winter's brush
	Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare
	For every storm that blows; I, to bear this,
	That never knew but better, is some burden:
	Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time
	Hath made thee hard in 't. Why shouldst thou hate men?
	They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given?
	If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,
	Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff
	To some she beggar and compounded thee
	Poor rogue hereditary. Hence! be gone!
	If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,
	Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.
<SPEECH 145><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>

<SPEECH 160><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
	A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee to attain to. If thou wert the lion, the fox would beguile thee; if thou wert the lamb, the fox would eat thee; if thou wert the fox, the lion would suspect thee, when peradventure thou wert accused by the ass; if thou wert the ass, thy dulness would torment thee, and still thou livedst but as a breakfast to the wolf; if thou wert the wolf, thy greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner; wert thou the unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury; wert thou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse; wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by the leopard; wert thou a leopard, thou wert german to the lion, and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life; all thy safety were remotion, and thy defence absence. What beast couldst thou be, that were not subject to a beast? and what a beast art thou already, that seest not thy loss in transformation!

	Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;
	Lie where the light foam of the sea may beat
	Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph,
	That death in me at others' lives may laugh.
	O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce
	'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
	Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
	Thou ever young, fresh, lov'd, and delicate wooer,
	Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow
	That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god,
	That solder'st close impossibilities,
	And mak'st them kiss! that speak'st with every tongue,
	To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts!
	Think, thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue
	Set them into confounding odds, that beasts
	May have the world in empire.

<SPEECH 174><ACT 4><SCENE 3><80%>
	Both too; and women's sons.
<SPEECH 175><ACT 4><SCENE 3><80%>
	Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.
	Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots;
	Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;
	The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips;
	The bounteous housewife, nature, on each bush
	Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?
<SPEECH 176><ACT 4><SCENE 3><80%>
	Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes;
	You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
	That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not
	In holier shapes; for there is boundless theft
	In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
	Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,
	Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
	And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician;
	His antidotes are poison, and he slays
	More than you rob: take wealth and lives together;
	Do villany, do, since you protest to do't,
	Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery:
	The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction
	Robs the vast sea; the moon's an arrant thief,
	And her pale fire she snatches from the sun;
	The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
	The moon into salt tears; the earth's a thief,
	That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
	From general excrement, each thing's a thief;
	The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power
	Have uncheck'd theft. Love not yourselves; away!
	Rob one another. There's more gold: cut throats;
	All that you meet are thieves. To Athens go,
	Break open shops; nothing can you steal
	But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this
	I give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er!
	Amen.
<SPEECH 177><ACT 4><SCENE 3><82%>
	Away! what art thou?
<SPEECH 178><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
	Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;
	Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee.
<SPEECH 179><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
	Then I know thee not:
	I never had an honest man about me; ay all
	I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.
<SPEECH 180><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
	What! dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I love thee,
	Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st
	Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give,
	But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:
	Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!
<SPEECH 181><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
	Had I a steward
	So true, so just, and now so comfortable?
	It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.
	Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man
	Was born of woman.
	Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,
	You perpetual sober gods! I do proclaim
	One honest man, mistake me not, but one;
	No more, I pray, and he's a steward.
	How fain would I have hated all mankind!
	And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,
	I fell with curses.
	Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;
	For, by oppressing and betraying me,
	Thou mightst have sooner got another service:
	For many so arrive at second masters
	Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true,—
	For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure,—
	Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,
	If not a usuring kindness and as rich men deal gifts,
	Expecting in return twenty for one?
<SPEECH 182><ACT 4><SCENE 3><84%>
	Look thee, 'tis so. Thou singly honest man,
	Here, take: the gods out of my misery,
	Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy;
	But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;
	Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,
	But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,
	Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs
	What thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em,
	Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like blasted woods,
	And may diseases lick up their false bloods!
	And so, farewell and thrive.
<SPEECH 183><ACT 4><SCENE 3><85%>
	If thou hatest

	E'en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy fiction,

	But for all this, my honest-natur'd friends,
	I must needs say you have a little fault:

<SPEECH 198><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,

	Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:—
	If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,
	Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,
	That Timon cares not. But if he sack fair Athens,
	And take our goodly aged men by the beards,
	Giving our holy virgins to the stain
	Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war;
	Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,
	In pity of our aged and our youth
	I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,
	And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not
	While you have throats to answer: for myself,
	There's not a whittle in the unruly camp
	But I do prize it at my love before
	The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you
	To the protection of the prosperous gods,
	As thieves to keepers.
<SPEECH 205><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	Why, I was writing of my epitaph;
	It will be seen to-morrow. My long sickness

	And last so long enough!
<SPEECH 206><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>

	And tell them, that, to ease them of their griefs,
	Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,
	Their pangs of love, with other incident throes
	That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain
	In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:
	I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.

	I have a tree which grows here in my close,
	That mine own use invites me to cut down,
	And shortly must I fell it; tell my friends,
	Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree,
	From high to low throughout, that whoso please
	To stop affliction, let him take his haste,
	Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,
	And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.

	Come not to me again; but say to Athans,
	Timon hath made his everlasting mansion
	Upon the beached verge of the salt flood;
	Who once a day with his embossed froth
	The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,
	And let my grave-stone be your oracle.
	Lips, let sour words go by and language end:
	What is amiss plague and infection mend!
	Graves only be men's works and death their gain!
	Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.
