	My lord, you have my voice to it; the fault's
	Bloody; 'tis necessary he should die;
	Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 5><49%>
	Now, captain.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 5><50%>
	You undergo too strict a paradox,
	Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:
	Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd
	To bring manslaughter into form, and set quarrelling
	Upon the head of valour; which indeed
	Is valour misbegot, and came into the world
	When sects and factions were newly born.
	He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer
	The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs
	His outsides, to wear them like his raiment, carelessly,
	And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,
	To bring it into danger.
	If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,
	What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 5><50%>
	You cannot make gross sins look clear;
	To revenge is no valour, but to bear.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 5><51%>
	What's that?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 5><52%>
	He dies.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 5><52%>
	We are for law; he dies: urge it no more,
	On height of our displeasure. Friend, or brother,
	He forfeits his own blood that spills another.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>
	Do you dare our anger?
	'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;
	We banish thee for ever.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>
	If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee,
	Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell our spirit,
	He shall be executed presently.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	Bring us to his cave:
	It is our part and promise to the Athenians
	To speak with Timon.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	Worthy Timon,—
<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	O! forget
	What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.
	The senators with one consent of love
	Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
	On special dignities, which vacant lie
	For thy best use and wearing.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	Therefore so please thee to return with us,
	And of our Athens—thine and ours—to take
	The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,
	Allow'd with absolute power, and thy good name
	Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back
	Of Alcibiades the approaches wild;
	Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up
	His country's peace.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	Therefore, Timon,—
<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	We speak in vain.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	That's well spoke.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	These words become your lips as they pass through them.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 1><95%>
	His discontents are unremovably Coupled to nature.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 1><95%>
	It requires swift foot.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	Thou hast painfully discover'd: are his files
	As full as thy report?
<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	Here come our brothers.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 4><97%>
	Noble and young,
	When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,
	Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,
	We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,
	To wipe out our ingratitude with loves
	Above their quantity.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 4><97%>
	These walls of ours
	Were not erected by their hands from whom
	You have receiv'd your grief; nor are they such
	That these great towers, trophies, and schools should fall
	For private faults in them.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 4><98%>
	All have not offended;
	For those that were, it is not square to take
	On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
	Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,
	Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage:
	Spare thyAthenian cradle, and those kin
	Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
	With those that have offended: like a shepherd,
	Approach the fold and cull th' infected forth,
	But kill not all together.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 4><98%>
	Set but thy foot
	Against our rampir'd gates, and they shall ope,
	So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,
	To say thou'lt enter friendly.
