	He has made too much plenty with 'em;
	He's a sworn rioter; he has a sin that often
	Drowns him and takes his valour prisoner;
	If there were no foes, that were enough
	To overcome him; in that beastly fury
	He has been known to commit outrages
	And cherish factions; 'tis inferr'd to us,
	His days are foul and his drink dangerous.

	How!

	At all times alike
	Men are not still the same: 'twas time and griefs
	That fram'd him thus: time, with his fairer hand,
	Offering the fortunes of his former days,
	The former man may make him. Bring us to him,
	And chance it as it may.

	The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	They confess
	Toward thee forgetfulness to general, gross;
	Which now the public body, which doth seldom
	Play the recanter, feeling in itself
	A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
	Of its own fail, restraining aid to Timon;
	And send forth us, to make their sorrow'd render,
	Together with a recompense more fruitful
	Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
	Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
	As shall to thee block out what wrongs were theirs,
	And write in thee the figures of their love,
	Ever to read them thine.

	And shakes his threat'ning sword
	Against the walls of Athens.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	And enter in our ears like great triumphers
	In their applauding gates.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
	I like this well; he will return again.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 1><95%>
	Our hope in him is dead: let us return,
	And strain what other means is left unto us
	In our dear peril.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	We stand much hazard if they bring not Timon.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 4><97%>
	So did we woo
	Transformed Timon to our city's love
	By humble message and by promis'd means:
	We were not all unkind, nor all deserve
	The common stroke of war.

	Nor are they living
	Who were the motives that you first went out;
	Shame that they wanted cunning in excess
	Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,
	Into our city with thy banners spread:
	By decimation, and a tithed death,—
	If thy revenges hunger for that food
	Which nature loathes,—take thou the destin'd tenth,
	And by the hazard of the spotted die
	Let die the spotted.

	What thou wilt,
	Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
	Thank hew to't with thy sword.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 4><98%>
	Throw thy glove,
	Or any token of thine honour else,
	That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
	And not as our confusion, all thy powers
	Shall make their harbour in our town, till we
	Have seal'd thy full desire.
