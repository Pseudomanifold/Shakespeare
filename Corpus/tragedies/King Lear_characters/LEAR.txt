	Attend the Lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
	Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
	In three our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intent
	To shake all cares and business from our age,
	Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
	Unburden'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
	And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
	We have this hour a constant will to publish
	Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
	May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
	Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
	Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
	And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,—
	Since now we will divest us both of rule,
	Interest of territory, cares of state,—
	Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
	That we our largest bounty may extend
	Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
	Our eldest-born, speak first.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
	With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
	With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
	We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue
	Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,
	Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	To thee and thine, hereditary ever,
	Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,
	No less in space, validity, and pleasure,
	Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,
	Although our last, not least; to whose young love
	The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
	Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
	A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Nothing?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	But goes thy heart with this?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	So young, and so untender?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Let it be so; thy truth then be thy dower:
	For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
	The mysteries of Hecate and the night,
	By all the operation of the orbs
	From whom we do exist and cease to be,
	Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
	Propinquity and property of blood,
	And as a stranger to my heart and me
	Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
	Or he that makes his generation messes
	To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
	Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd,
	As thou my sometime daughter.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Peace, Kent!
	Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
	I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest
	On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!
	So be my grave my peace, as here I give
	Her father's heart from her! Call France. Who stirs?
	Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,
	With my two daughters' dowers digest the third;
	Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
	I do invest you jointly with my power,
	Pre-eminence, and all the large effects
	That troop with majesty. Ourself by monthly course,
	With reservation of a hundred knights,
	By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
	Make with you by due turn. Only we shall retain
	The name and all th' addition to a king;
	The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
	Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,
	This coronet part between you.

	Which we durst never yet,—and, with strain'd pride
	To come betwixt our sentence and our power,—
	Which nor our nature nor our place can hear,—
	Our potency made good, take thy reward.
	Five days we do allot thee for provision
	To shield thee from diseases of the world;
	And, on the sixth, to turn thy hated back
	Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following
	Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
	The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,
	This shall not be revok'd.

	My Lord of Burgundy,
	We first address toward you, who with this king
	Hath rivall'd for our daughter. What, in the least,
	Will you require in present dower with her,
	Or cease your quest of love?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Right noble Burgundy,
	When she was dear to us we did hold her so,
	But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:
	If aught within that little-seeming substance,
	Or all of it, with our displeasure piec'd,
	And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,
	She's there, and she is yours.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
	Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
	Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
	Take her, or leave her?
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,
	I tell you all her wealth.—<STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> For you, great king,
	I would not from your love make such a stray
	To match you where I hate; therefore, beseech you
	To avert your liking a more worthier way
	Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd
	Almost to acknowledge hers.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>

	Thou hast her, France; let her be thine, for we

	Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,
	Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,
	And cast you, with the waters that you lose,

	Let it be so: I have another daughter,
	Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:
	When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
	She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find

	No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:
	Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give

	To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
	To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
	And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt

	Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took
	Our youngest born, I could as well be brought

	Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
	Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,

	O! reason not the need; our basest beggars
	Are in the poorest thing superfluous:
	Allow not nature more than nature needs,
	Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady;
	If only to go warm were gorgeous,
	Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,
	Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,—
	You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
	You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
	As full of grief as age; wretched in both!
	If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts
	Against their father, fool me not so much
	To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
	And let not women's weapons, water-drops,
	Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,
	I will have such revenges on you both
	That all the world shall—I will do such things,—
	What they are yet I know not,—but they shall be
	The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep;
	No, I'll not weep:
	I have full cause of weeping, but this heart
	Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
	Or ere I'll weep. O fool! I shall go mad.
<SPEECH 117><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
	You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
	Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!
	You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,
	Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
	Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,
	Strike flat the thick rotundity o' the world!
	Crack nature's moulds, all germens spill at once
	That make ingrateful man!
<SPEECH 118><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	Rumble thy bellyfull Spit, fire! spout, rain!
	Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters:
	I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness;
	I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,
	You owe me no subscription: then, let fall
	Your horrible pleasure; here I stand, your slave,
	A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.
	But yet I call you servile ministers,
	That have with two pernicious daughters join'd
	Your high-engender'd battles 'gainst a head
	So old and white as this. O! O! 'tis foul.
<SPEECH 119><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	No, I will be the pattern of all patience; I will say nothing.
<SPEECH 120><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	Let the great gods,

	Thou perjur'd, and thou simular of virtue
	That art incestuous; caitiff, to pieces shake,
	That under covert and convenient seeming
	Hast practis'd on man's life; close pent-up guilts,
	Rive your concealing continents, and cry
	These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man
	More sinn'd against than sinning.
<SPEECH 121><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	My wits begin to turn.
	Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold?
	I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?
	The art of our necessities is strange,
	That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel.
	Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart
	That's sorry yet for thee.

	True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.

	Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
	Invades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee;
	But where the greater malady is fix'd,
	The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear;
	But if thy flight lay toward the roaring sea,
	Thou'dst meet the bear i' the mouth. When the mind's free
	The body's delicate; the tempest in my mind
	Doth from my senses take all feeling else
	Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!
	Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
	For lifting food to 't? But I will punish home:
	No, I will weep no more. In such a night
	To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.
	In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!
	Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all,—
	O! that way madness lies; let me shun that;
	No more of that.
<SPEECH 126><ACT 3><SCENE 4><52%>
	Prithee, go in thyself; seek thine own ease:
	This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
	On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.
	</STAGE DIR> In, boy; go first. You houseless poverty,—
	Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.
	Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,
	That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
	How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
	Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you
	From seasons such as these? O! I have ta'en
	Too little care of this. Take physic, pomp;
	Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
	That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,
	And show the heavens more just.

	What hast thou been?
<SPEECH 132><ACT 3><SCENE 4><55%>
	Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies. Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! here's three on's are sophisticated; thou art the thing itself; unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings! Come; unbutton here.

	She cannot deny it.
<SPEECH 147><ACT 3><SCENE 6><59%>
	And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaim

	Nature's above art in that respect. There's your press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look, look! a mouse. Peace, peace! this piece of toasted cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O! well flown, bird; i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh! Give the word.

	Pass.
<SPEECH 154><ACT 4><SCENE 6><78%>
	Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flatter'd me like a dog, and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay' and 'no' to everything I said! 'Ay' and 'no' too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me once and the wind to make me chatter, when the thunder would not peace at my bidding, there I found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are not men o' their words: they told me I was every thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.
<SPEECH 155><ACT 4><SCENE 6><78%>
	Ay, every inch a king:
	When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
	I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?
	Adultery?
	Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
	The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly
	Does lecher in my sight.
	Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
	Was kinder to his father than my daughters
	Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
	To 't luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
	Behold yond simpering dame,
	Whose face between her forks presageth snow;
	That minces virtue, and does shake the head
	To hear of pleasure's name;
	The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to 't
	With a more riotous appetite.
	Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
	Though women all above:
	But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
	Beneath is all the fiends':
	There's hell, there's darkness, there is the sulphurous pit,
	Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie, fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination: there's money for thee.

	Read.
<SPEECH 159><ACT 4><SCENE 6><79%>
	O, ho! are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse in a light: yet you see how this world goes.

	What! art mad? A man may see how this world goes with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yound justice rails upon yon simple thief. Hark, in thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?
<SPEECH 161><ACT 4><SCENE 6><79%>
	And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold the great image of authority; a dog's obey'd in office.
	Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
	Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;
	Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind
	For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
	Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
	Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
	And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;
	Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw doth pierce it.
	None does offend, none, I say none; I'll able 'em:
	Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
	To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;
	And, like a scurvy politician, seem
	To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now;
	Pull off my boots; harder, harder; so.

	If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes;

	When we are born, we cry that we are come

	No rescue? What! a prisoner? I am even

	I feel this pin prick. Would I were assur'd
	Of my condition!
<SPEECH 171><ACT 4><SCENE 7><85%>
	Pray, do not mock me:
	I am a very foolish fond old man,
	Fourscore and upward, not an hour more or less;
	And, to deal plainly,
	I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
	Methinks I should know you and know this man;
	Yet I am doubtful: for I am mainly ignorant
	What place this is, and all the skill I have
	Remembers not these garments; nor I know not
	Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;
	For, as I am a man, I think this lady
	To be my child Cordelia.
<SPEECH 172><ACT 4><SCENE 7><85%>
	Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray, weep not:

	No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison;
	We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:
	When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,
	And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,
	And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
	At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
	Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,
	Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;
	And take upon's the mystery of things,
	As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,
	In a wall'd prison, packs and sets of great ones
	That ebb and flow by the moon.

	Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
