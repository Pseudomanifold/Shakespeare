	</STAGE DIR> What shall Cordelia do? Love, and be silent.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	</STAGE DIR> Then, poor Cordelia!
	And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's
	More richer than my tongue.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Nothing, my lord.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Nothing.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
	My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
	According to my bond; nor more nor less.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Good my lord,
	You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me: I
	Return those duties back as are right fit,
	Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
	Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
	They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
	That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
	Half my love with him, half my care and duty:
	Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,
	To love my father all.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Ay, good my lord.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	So young, my lord, and true.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	I yet beseech your majesty—
	If for I want that glib and oily art
	To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,
	I'll do 't before I speak—that you make known
	It is no vicious blot nor other foulness,
	No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
	That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour,
	But even for want of that for which I am richer,
	A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
	That I am glad I have not, though not to have it
	Hath lost me in your liking.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	Peace be with Burgundy!
	Since that respects of fortune are his love,
	I shall not be his wife.

	The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
	Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;
	And like a sister am most loath to call
	Your faults as they are nam'd. Use well our father:
	To your professed bosoms I commit him:
	But yet, alas! stood I within his grace,
	I would prefer him to a better place.
	So farewell to you both.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides;

	Well may you prosper!

	Alack! 'tis he: why, he was met even now
	As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;
	Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,
	With burdocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,
	Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
	In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;
	Search every acre in the high-grown field,
	And bring him to our eye.
	What can man's wisdom
	In the restoring his bereaved sense?
	He that helps him take all my outward worth.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 4><73%>
	All bless'd secrets,
	All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,
	Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate
	In the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him,
	Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
	That wants the means to lead it.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 4><73%>
	'Tis known before; our preparation stands
	In expectation of them. O dear father!
	It is thy business that I go about;
	Therefore great France
	My mourning and important tears hath pitied,
	No blown ambition doth our arms incite,
	But love, dear love, and our ag'd father's right,
	Soon may I hear and see him!
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 7><83%>
	O thou good Kent! how shall I live and work
	To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,
	And every measure fail me.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 7><84%>
	Be better suited:
	These weeds are memories of those worser hours:
	I prithee, put them off.

	O you kind gods,

<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 7><84%>
	Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed

	Very well.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 7><84%>
	O my dear father! Restoration, hang

	Had you not been their father, these white flakes
	Had challeng'd pity of them. Was this a face
	To be expos'd against the warring winds?
	To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
	In the most terrible and nimble stroke
	Of quick cross lightning? to watch—poor perdu!—
	With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,
	Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
	Against my fire. And wast thou fain, poor father,
	To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn,
	In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!
	'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
	Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.
