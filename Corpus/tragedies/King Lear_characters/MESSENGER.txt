	O! my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead;
	Slain by his servant, going to put out
	The other eye of Gloucester.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 2><70%>
	A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,
	Oppos'd against the act, bending his sword
	To his great master; who, thereat enrag'd,
	Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;
	But not without that harmful stroke, which since
	Hath pluck'd him after.

	Both, both, my lord.
	This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;
	'Tis from your sister.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 2><71%>
	Come with my lady hither.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 2><71%>
	No, my good lord; I met him back again.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 2><71%>
	Ay, my good lord; 'twas he inform'd against him,
	And quit the house on purpose that their punishment
	Might have the freer course.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 4><73%>
	News, madam;
	The British powers are marching hitherward.
