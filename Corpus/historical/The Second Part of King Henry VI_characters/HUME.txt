	This they have promised, to show your highness
	A spirit rais'd from depth of under ground,

	Hume must make merry with the duchess' gold;
	Marry and shall. But how now, Sir John Hume!
	Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:
	The business asketh silent secrecy.
	Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:
	Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil.
	Yet have I gold flies from another coast:
	I dare not say from the rich cardinal
	And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk;
	Yet I do find it so: for, to be plain,
	They, knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour,
	Have hired me to undermine the duchess
	And buzz these conjurations in her brain.
	They say, 'A crafty knave does need no broker;'
	Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal's broker.
	Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near
	To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.
	Well, so it stands; and thus, I fear, at last
	Hume's knavery will be the duchess' wrack,
	And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall.
	Sort how it will I shall have gold for all.

	Come, my masters; the duchess, I tell you, expects performance of your promises.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 4><19%>
	Ay; what else? fear you not her courage.
