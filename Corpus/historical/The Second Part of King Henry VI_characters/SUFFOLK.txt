	As by your high imperial majesty
	I had in charge at my depart for France,
	As procurator to your excellence,
	To marry Princess Margaret for your Grace;
	So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
	In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,
	The Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Britaine, and Alençon,
	Seven earls, twelve barons, and twenty reverend bishops,
	I have perform'd my task, and was espous'd:
	And humbly now upon my bended knee,
	In sight of England and her lordly peers,
	Deliver up my title in the queen
	To your most gracious hands, that are the substance
	Of that great shadow I did represent;
	The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,
	The fairest queen that ever king receiv'd.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	My Lord Protector, so it please your Grace,
	Here are the articles of contracted peace
	Between our sovereign and the French King Charles,
	For eighteen months concluded by consent.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
	How now, fellow! wouldst anything with me?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
	Thy wife too! that is some wrong indeed. What's yours? What's here? Against the Duke of Suffolk, for enclosing the commons of Melford! How now, sir knave!
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
	Who is there?
	Take this fellow in, and send for his master with a pursuivant presently. We'll hear more of your matter before the king.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><13%>
	Madam, be patient; as I was cause
	Your highness came to England, so will I
	In England work your Grace's full content.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	And he of these that can do most of all
	Cannot do more in England than the Nevils:
	Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	Madam, myself have lim'd a bush for her,
	And plac'd a quire of such enticing birds
	That she will light to listen to the lays,
	And never mount to trouble you again.
	So, let her rest: and, madam, list to me;
	For I am bold to counsel you in this.
	Although we fancy not the cardinal,
	Yet must we join with him and with the lords
	Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.
	As for the Duke of York, this late complaint
	Will make but little for his benefit:
	So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,
	And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	Resign it then and leave thine insolence.
	Since thou wertking,—as who is king but thou?—
	The commonwealth hath daily run to wrack;
	The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas;
	And all the peers and nobles of the realm
	Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	Before we make election, give me leave
	To show some reason, of no little force,
	That York is most unmeet of any man.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	Peace, headstrong Warwick!
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	Because here is a man accus'd of treason:
	Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	Please it your majesty, this is the man
	That doth accuse his master of high treason.
	His words were these: that Richard, Duke of York,
	Was rightful heir unto the English crown,
	And that your majesty was a usurper.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	No marvel, an it like your majesty,
	My Lord Protector's hawks do tower so well;
	They know their master loves to be aloft,
	And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	No malice, sir; no more than well becomes
	So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	Why, as you, my lord,
	An't like your lordly lord-protectorship.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Come to the king, and tell him what miracle.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	What woman is this?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	How cam'st thou so?
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	And yet, I think, jet did he never see.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	True; made the lame to leap and fly away.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
	Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays;
	Thus Eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 1><39%>
	Well hath your highness seen into this duke;
	And had I first been put to speak my mind,
	I think I should have told your Grace's tale.
	The duchess, by his subornation,
	Upon my life, began her devilish practices:
	Or if he were not privy to those faults,
	Yet, by reputing of his high descent,
	As, next the king he was successive heir,
	And such high vaunts of his nobility,
	Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess,
	By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.
	Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep,
	And in his simple show he harbours treason.
	The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb:
	No, no, my sov'reign; Gloucester is a man
	Unsounded yet, and full of deep deceit.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,
	Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:
	I do arrest thee of high treason here.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answer'd:
	But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,
	Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.
	I do arrest you in his highness' name;
	And here commit you to my Lord Cardinal
	To keep until your further time of trial.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
	With ignominious words, though clerkly couch'd,
	As if she had suborned some to swear
	False allegations to o'erthrow his state?
<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	But in my mind that were no policy:
	The king will labour still to save his life;
	The commons haply rise to save his life;
	And yet we have but trivial argument,
	More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Ah! York, no man alive so fain as I.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Madam, 'tis true: and were't not madness, then,
	To make the fox surveyor of the fold?
	Who, being accus'd a crafty murderer,
	His guilt should be but idly posted over
	Because his purpose is not executed.
	No; let him die, in that he is a fox,
	By nature prov'd an enemy to the flock,
	Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood,
	As Humphrey, prov'd by reasons, to my liege.
	And do not stand on quillets how to slay him:
	Be it by gins, by snares, by subtilty,
	Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,
	So he be dead; for that is good deceit
	Which mates him first that first intends deceit.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	Not resolute, except so much were done,
	For things are often spoke and seldom meant;
	But, that my heart accordeth with my tongue,
	Seeing the deed is meritorious,
	And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,
	Say but the word and I will be his priest.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	Here is my hand, the deed is worthy doing.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Why, our authority is his consent,
	And what we do establish he confirms:
	Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	A charge, Lord York, that I will see perform'd.
	But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	I'll see it truly done, my Lord of York.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	Now, sirs, have you dispatch'd this thing?
<SPEECH 36><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	Why, that's well said. Go, get you to my house;
	I will reward you for this venturous deed.
	The king and all the peers are here at hand.
	Have you laid fair the bed? is all things well,
	According as I gave directions?
<SPEECH 37><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	Away! be gone.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	I'll call him presently, my noble lord.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	Dead in his bed, my lord; Gloucester is dead.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	He doth revive again. Madam, be patient.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	Comfort, my sovereign! grocious Henry, comfort!
<SPEECH 42><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!
	What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?
<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	Why, Warwick, who should do the duke to death?
	Myself and Beaufort had him in protection;
	And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men;
	But here's a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,
	That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
	That slanders me with murder's crimson badge.
	Say, if thou dar'st, proud Lord of Warwickshire,
	That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
	Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanour!
	If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much,
	Thy mother took into her blameful bed
	Some stern untutor'd churl, and noble stock
	Was graft with crab-tree slip; whose fruit thou art,
	And never of the Nevils' noble race.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
	Thou shalt be waking while I shed thy blood,
	If from this presence thou dar'st go with me.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	The traitorous Warwick, with the men of Bury,
	Set all upon me, mighty sovereign.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	'Tis like the commons, rude unpolish'd hinds,
	Could send such message to their sovereign;
	But you, my lord, were glad to be employ'd,
	To show how quaint an orator you are:
	But all the honour Salisbury hath won
	Is that he was the lord ambassador,
	Sent from a sort of tinkers to the king.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
	Cease, gentle queen, these execrations,
	And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
	A plague upon them! Wherefore should I curse them?
	Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake's groan,
	I would invent as bitter-searching terms,
	As curst, as harsh and horrible to hear,
	Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth,
	With full as many signs of deadly hate,
	As lean-fac'd Envy in her loathsome cave.
	My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words;
	Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;
	My hair be fix'd on end, as one distract;
	Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban:
	And even now my burden'd heart would break
	Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
	Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!
	Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!
	Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks!
	Their softest touch as smart as lizard's stings!
	Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss,
	And boding screech-owls make the concert full!
	All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell—
<SPEECH 51><ACT 3><SCENE 2><60%>
	You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?
	Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from,
	Well could I curse away a winter's night,
	Though standing naked on a mountain top,
	Where biting cold would never let grass grow,
	And think it but a minute spent in sport.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 3><SCENE 2><60%>
	Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished,
	Once by the king, and three times thrice by thee.
	'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;
	A wilderness is populous enough,
	So Suffolk had thy heavenly company:
	For where thou art, there is the world itself,
	With every several pleasure in the world,
	And where thou art not, desolation.
	I can no more: live thou to joy thy life;
	Myself to joy in nought but that thou liv'st.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 3><SCENE 2><61%>
	If I depart from thee I cannot live;
	And in thy sight to die, what were it else
	But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?
	Here could I breathe my soul into the air,
	As mild and gentle as the cradle babe,
	Dying with mother's dug between its lips;
	Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad,
	And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,
	To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth:
	So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,
	Or I should breathe it so into thy body,
	And then it liv'd in sweet Elysium.
	To die by thee, were but to die in jest;
	From thee to die were torture more than death.
	O! let me stay, befall what may befall!
<SPEECH 54><ACT 3><SCENE 2><62%>
	I go.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 3><SCENE 2><62%>
	A jewel, lock'd into the woefull'st cask
	That ever did contain a thing of worth.
	Even as a splitted bark, so sunder we:
	This way fall I to death.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
	Look on my George; I am a gentleman:
	Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.
	A cunning man did calculate my birth,
	And told me that by Water I should die:
	Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;
	Thy name is—Gaultier, being rightly sounded.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	Stay, Whitmore; for thy prisoner is a prince,
	The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	Ay, but these rags are no part of the duke:
	Jove sometimes went disguis'd, and why not I?
<SPEECH 60><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood,
	The honourable blood of Lancaster,
	Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.
	Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?
	Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule,
	And thought thee happy when I shook my head?
	How often hast thou waited at my cup,
	Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board,
	When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?
	Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n;
	Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride.
	How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood
	And duly waited for my coming forth?
	This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,
	And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.
<SPEECH 61><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
	Base slave, thy words are blunt, and so art thou.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
	Thou dar'st not for thy own.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
	Pole!
<SPEECH 64><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
	O! that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder
	Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges.
	Small things make base men proud: this villain here,
	Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more
	Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate.
	Drones suck not eagles' blood, but rob beehives.
	It is impossible that I should die
	By such a lowly vassal as thyself.
	Thy words move rage, and not remorse in me:
	I go of message from the queen to France;
	I charge thee, waft me safely cross the Channel.
<SPEECH 65><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
	Gelidus timor occupat artus: 'tis thee I fear.
<SPEECH 66><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
	Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough,
	Us'd to command, untaught to plead for favour.
	Far be it we should honour such as these
	With humble suit: no, rather let my head
	Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
	Save to the God of heaven, and to my king;
	And sooner dance upon a bloody pole
	Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.
	True nobility is exempt from fear:
	More can I bear than you dare execute.
<SPEECH 67><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
	Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,
	That this my death may never be forgot.
	Great men oft die by vile bezonians.
	A Roman sworder and banditto slave
	Murder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand
	Stabb'd Julius Cæsar; savage islanders
	Pompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates.
