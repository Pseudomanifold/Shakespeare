	Talbot, my life, my joy! again return'd!
	How wert thou handled being prisoner?
	Or by what means got'st thou to be releas'd,
	Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.

	Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.

	I grieve to hear what torments you endur'd;
	But we will be reveng'd sufficiently.
	Now it is supper-time in Orleans:
	Here, through this grate, I count each one,
	And view the Frenchmen how they fortify:
	Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.
	Sir Thomas Gargrave, and Sir William Glansdale,
	Let me have your express opinions
	Where is best place to make our battery next.
