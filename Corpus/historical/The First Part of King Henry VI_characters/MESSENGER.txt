	My honourable lords, health to you all!
	Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,
	Of loss, of slaughter, and discomfiture:
	Guienne, Champaigne, Rheims, Orleans,
	Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	No treachery; but want of men and money.
	Among the soldiers this is muttered,
	That here you maintain several factions;
	And, whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,
	You are disputing of your generals.
	One would have lingering wars with little cost;
	Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;
	A third thinks, without expense at all,
	By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.
	Awake, awake, English nobility!
	Let not sloth dim your honours new-begot:
	Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;
	Of England's coat one half is cut away.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 4><20%>
	My lord, my lord! the French have gather'd head:
	The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle join'd,
	A holy prophetess new risen up
	Is come with a great power to raise the siege.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	All hail, my lords! Which of this princely train
	Call ye the war-like Talbot, for his acts
	So much applauded through the realm of France?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne,
	With modesty admiring thy renown,
	By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe
	To visit her poor castle where she lies,
	That she may boast she hath beheld the man
	Whose glory fills the world with loud report.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 3><29%>
	Madam,
	According as your ladyship desir'd,
	By message crav'd, so is Lord Talbot come.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 3><29%>
	Madam, it is.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
	Stay, my Lord Talbot; for my lady craves
	To know the cause of your abrupt departure.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 3><68%>
	They are return'd, my lord; and give it out,
	That he is march'd to Bourdeaux with his power,
	To fight with Talbot. As he march'd along,
	By your espials were discovered
	Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led,
	Which join'd with him and made their march for Bourdeaux.
