	Lord regent, I do greet your excellence
	With letters of commission from the king.
	For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,
	Mov'd with remorse of these outrageous broils,
	Have earnestly implor'd a general peace
	Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;
	And here at hand the Dauphin, and his train,
	Approacheth to confer about some matter.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
	Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:
	That, in regard King Henry gives consent,
	Of mere compassion and of lenity,
	To ease your country of distressful war,
	And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,
	You shall become true liegemen to his crown:
	And, Charles, upon-condition thou wilt swear
	To pay him tribute, and submit thyself,
	Thou shalt be plac'd as viceroy under him,
	And still enjoy thy regal dignity.
