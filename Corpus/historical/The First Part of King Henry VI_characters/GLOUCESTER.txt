	England ne'er had a king until his time.
	Virtue he had, deserving to command:
	His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams;
	His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;
	His sparkling eyes, replete with wrathful fire,
	More dazzled and drove back his enemies
	Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.
	What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:
	He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd
	His thread of life had not so soon decay'd:
	None do you like but an effeminate prince,
	Whom like a school-boy you may over-awe.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Name not religion, for thou lov'st the flesh,
	And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st,
	Except it be to pray against thy foes.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Is Paris lost? is Roan yielded up?
	If Henry were recall'd to life again
	These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	We will not fly, but to our enemies' throats.
	Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can,
	To view the artillery and munition;
	And then I will proclaim young Henry king.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
	I am come to survey the Tower this day;
	Since Henry's death, I fear, there is conveyance.
	Where be these warders that they wait not here?
	Open the gates! 'Tis Gloucester that calls.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 3><13%>
	Who willed you? or whose will stands but mine?
	There's none protector of the realm but I.
	Break up the gates, I'll be your warrantize:
	Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 3><13%>
	Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear?
	Open the gates! here's Gloucester that would enter.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 3><13%>
	Faint-hearted Woodvile, prizest him 'fore me?
	Arrogant Winchester, that haughty prelate,
	Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne'er could brook?
	Thou art no friend to God or to the king:
	Open the gates, or I'll shut thee out shortly.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	Peel'd priest, dost thou command me to be shut out?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	Stand back, thou manifest conspirator,
	Thou that contriv'dst to murder our dead lord;
	Thou that giv'st whores indulgences to sin:
	I'll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal's hat,
	If thou proceed in this thy insolence.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	I will not slay thee, but I'll drive thee back:
	Thy scarlet robes as a child's bearing-cloth
	I'll use to carry thee out of this place.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	What! am I dar'd and bearded to my face?—
	Draw, men, for all this privileged place;
	Blue coats to tawny-coats. Priest, beware your beard;
	I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly.
	Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal's hat,
	In spite of pope or dignities of church,
	Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	Winchester goose! I cry a rope! a rope!
	Now beat them hence; why do you let them stay?
	Thee I'll chase hence, thou wolf in sheep's array.
	Out, tawny coats! out, scarlet hypocrite!
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	Peace, mayor! thou know'st little of my wrongs:
	Here's Beaufort, that regards nor God nor King,
	Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	I will not answer thee with words, but blows.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	Cardinal, I'll be no breaker of the law;
	But we shall meet and break our minds at large.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	Mayor, farewell: thou dost but what thou mayst.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	Presumptuous priest! this place commands my patience
	Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me.
	Think not, although in writing I preferr'd
	The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,
	That therefore I have forg'd, or am not able
	Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen:
	No, prelate; such is thy audacious wickedness,
	Thy lewd, pestiferous, and dissentious pranks,
	As very infants prattle of thy pride.
	Thou art a most pernicious usurer,
	Froward by nature, enemy to peace;
	Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems
	A man of thy profession and degree;
	And for thy treachery, what's more manifest?
	In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life
	As well at London Bridge as at the Tower.
	Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,
	The king, thy sov'reign, is not quite exempt
	From envious malice of thy swelling heart.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	As good!
	Thou bastard of my grandfather!
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	Am I not protector, saucy priest?
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps,
	And useth it to patronage his theft.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Thou art reverent,
	Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	You of my household, leave this peevish broil,
	And set this unaccustom'd fight aside.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Stay, stay, I say!
	And, if you love me, as you say you do,
	Let me persuade you to forbear a while.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Compassion on the king commands me stoop;
	Or I would see his heart out ere the priest
	Should ever get that privilege of me.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	</STAGE DIR> Ay; but I fear me, with a hollow heart.
	See here, my friends and loving countrymen,
	This token serveth for a flag of truce,
	Betwixt ourselves and all our followers.
	So help me God, as I dissemble not!
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	Well urg'd, my Lord of Warwick: for, sweet prince,
	An if your Grace mark every circumstance,
	You have great reason to do Richard right;
	Especially for those occasions
	At Eltham-place I told your majesty.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Now, will it best avail your majesty
	To cross the seas and to be crown'd in France.
	The presence of a king engenders love
	Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,
	As it disanimates his enemies.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Your ships already are in readiness.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 4><58%>
	Yes, if it please your majesty, my liege.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
	Lord bishop, set the crown upon his head.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
	Now, Governor of Paris, take your oath,—
	That you elect no other king but him,
	Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
	And none your foes but such as shall pretend
	Malicious practices against his state:
	This shall ye do, so help you righteous God!
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
	To say the truth, this fact was infamous
	And ill beseeming any common man,
	Much more a knight, a captain and a leader.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	</STAGE DIR> What means his Grace, that he hath chang'd his style?
	No more, but plain and bluntly, To the King!
	Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?
	Or doth this churlish superscription
	Pretend some alteration in good will?
	What's here? I have, upon especial cause,
	Mov'd with compassion of my country's wrack,
	Together with the pitiful complaints
	Of such as your oppression feeds upon,
	Forsaken your pernicious faction,
	And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.
	O, monstrous treachery! Can this be so,
	That in alliance, amity, and oaths,
	There should be found such false dissembling guile?
<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
	Confirm it so! Confounded be your strife!
	And perish ye, with your audacious prate!
	Presumptuous vassals! are you not asham'd,
	With this immodest clamorous outrage
	To trouble and disturb the king and us?—
	And you, my lords, methinks you do not well
	To bear with their perverse objections;
	Much less to take occasion from their mouths
	To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves:
	Let me persuade you take a better course.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
	I have, my lord; and their intent is this:
	They humbly sue unto your excellence
	To have a godly peace concluded of
	Between the realms of England and of France.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
	Well, my good lord; and as the only means
	To stop effusion of our Christian blood,
	And stablish quietness on every side.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
	Beside, my lord, the sooner to effect
	And surer bind this knot of amity,
	The Earl of Armagnac, near knit to Charles,
	A man of great authority in France,
	Proffers his only daughter to your Grace
	In marriage, with a large and sumptuous dowry.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
	And for the proffer of my lord your master,
	I have inform'd his highness so at large,
	As,—liking of the lady's virtuous gifts,
	Her beauty, and the value of her dower,—
	He doth intend she shall be England's queen.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
	So should I give consent to flatter sin.
	You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd
	Unto another lady of esteem;
	How shall we then dispense with that contract,
	And not deface your honour with reproach?
<SPEECH 46><ACT 5><SCENE 5><98%>
	Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?
	Her father is no better than an earl,
	Although in glorious titles he excel.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 5><SCENE 5><98%>
	And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,
	Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 5><100%>
	Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.
