	Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester,
	The special watchmen of our English weal,
	I would prevail, if prayers might prevail,
	To join your hearts in love and amity.
	O! what a scandal is it to our crown,
	That two such noble peers as ye should jar.
	Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell
	Civil dissension is a viperous worm,
	That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.
	What tumult's this?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	We charge you, on allegiance to ourself,
	To hold your slaught'ring hands, and keep the peace.—
	Pray, uncle Gloucester, mitigate this strife.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	O! how this discord doth afflict my soul!
	Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold
	My sighs and tears and will not once relent?
	Who should be pitiful if you be not?
	Or who should study to prefer a peace
	If holy churchmen take delight in broils?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach,
	That malice was a great and grievous sin;
	And will not you maintain the thing you teach,
	But prove a chief offender in the same?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	O loving uncle, kind Duke of Gloucester,
	How joyful am I made by this contract!
	Away, my masters! trouble us no more;
	But join in friendship, as your lords have done.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	And those occasions, uncle, were of force:
	Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is
	That Richard be restored to his blood.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	If Richard will be true, not that alone,
	But all the whole inheritance I give
	That doth belong unto the house of York,
	From whence you spring by lineal descent.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Stoop then and set your knee against my foot;
	And, in reguerdon of that duty done,
	I girt thee with the valiant sword of York:
	Rise, Richard, like a true Plantagenet,
	And rise created princely Duke of York.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	When Gloucester says the word, King Henry goes;
	For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 4><58%>
	Is this the Lord Talbot, uncle Gloucester,
	That hath so long been resident in France?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 4><58%>
	Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord!
	When I was young,—as yet I am not old,—
	I do remember how my father said,
	A stouter champion never handled sword.
	Long since we were resolved of your truth,
	Your faithful service and your toil in war;
	Yet never have you tasted our reward,
	Or been reguerdon'd with so much as thanks,
	Because till now we never saw your face:
	Therefore, stand up; and for these good deserts,
	We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury;
	And in our coronation take your place.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	Stain to thy countrymen! thou hear'st thy doom.
	Be packing therefore, thou that wast a knight;
	Henceforth we banish thee on pain of death.
	And now, my Lord Protector, view the letter
	Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	What! doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	Is that the worst this letter doth contain?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	Why then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him,
	And give him chastisement for this abuse.
	How say you, my lord? are you not content?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	Then gather strength, and march unto him straight:
	Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason,
	And what offence it is to flout his friends.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	Be patient, lords; and give them leave to speak.
	Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim?
	And wherefore crave you combat? or with whom?
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	What is that wrong whereof you both complain?
	First let me know, and then I'll answer you.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	Good Lord! what madness rules in brain-sick men,
	When, for so slight and frivolous a cause,
	Such factious emulations shall arise!
	Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,
	Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
	Come hither, you that would be combatants.
	Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,
	Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.
	And you, my lords, remember where we are;
	In France, amongst a fickle wav'ring nation.
	If they perceive dissension in our looks,
	And that within ourselves we disagree,
	How will their grudging stomachs be provok'd
	To wilful disobedience, and rebel!
	Beside, what infamy will there arise,
	When foreign princes shall be certified
	That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
	King Henry's peers and chief nobility
	Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!
	O! think upon the conquest of my father,
	My tender years, and let us not forego
	That for a trifle that was bought with blood!
	Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
	I see no reason, if I wear this rose,
	That any one should therefore be suspicious
	I more incline to Somerset than York:
	Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.
	As well they may upbraid me with my crown,
	Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown'd.
	But your discretions better can persuade
	Than I am able to instruct or teach:
	And therefore, as we hither came in peace,
	So let us still continue peace and love.
	Cousin of York, we institute your Grace
	To be our regent in these parts of France:
	And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite
	Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;
	And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
	Go cheerfully together and digest
	Your angry choler on your enemies.
	Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest,
	After some respite will return to Calais;
	From thence to England; where I hope ere long
	To be presented by your victories,
	With Charles, Alençon, and that traitorous rout.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
	Have you perus'd the letters from the pope,
	The emperor, and the Earl of Armagnac?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
	How doth your Grace affect their motion?
<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
	Ay, marry, uncle; for I always thought
	It was both impious and unnatural
	That such immanity and bloody strife
	Should reign among professors of one faith.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
	Marriage, uncle! alas! my years are young,
	And fitter is my study and my books
	Than wanton dalliance with a paramour.
	Yet call the ambassadors; and, as you please,
	So let them have their answers every one:
	I shall be well content with any choice
	Tends to God's glory and my country's weal.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
	My lords ambassadors, your several suits
	Have been consider'd, and debated on.
	Your purpose is both good and reasonable;
	And therefore are we certainly resolv'd
	To draw conditions of a friendly peace;
	Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean
	Shall be transported presently to France.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
	</STAGE DIR> In argument and proof of which contract,
	Bear her this jewel, pledge of my affection.
	And so, my lord protector, see them guarded,
	And safely brought to Dover; where inshipp'd
	Commit them to the fortune of the sea.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
	Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,
	Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:
	Her virtues, graced with external gifts
	Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:
	And like as rigour of tempestuous gusts
	Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,
	So am I driven by breath of her renown
	Either to suffer shipwrack, or arrive
	Where I may have fruition of her love.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
	And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.
	Therefore, my Lord Protector, give consent
	That Margaret may be England's royal queen.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 5><99%>
	Whether it be through force of your report,
	My noble lord of Suffolk, or for that
	My tender youth was never yet attaint
	With any passion of inflaming love,
	I cannot tell; but this I am assur'd,
	I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,
	Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,
	As I am sick with working of my thoughts.
	Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;
	Agree to any covenants, and procure
	That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come
	To cross the seas to England and be crown'd
	King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:
	For your expenses and sufficient charge,
	Among the people gather up a tenth.
	Be gone, I say; for till you do return
	I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.
	And you, good uncle, banish all offence:
	If you do censure me by what you were,
	Not what you are, I know it will excuse
	This sudden execution of my will.
	And so, conduct me, where, from company
	I may revolve and ruminate my grief.
