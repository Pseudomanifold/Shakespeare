	Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch;
	Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth;
	Between two blades, which bears the better temper;
	Between two horses, which doth bear him best;
	Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye;
	I have perhaps, some shallow spirit of judgment;
	But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,
	Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
	I love no colours, and, without all colour
	Of base insinuating flattery
	I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
	Now, by God's will, thou wrong'st him, Somerset:
	His grandfather was Lionel, Duke of Clarence,
	Third son to the third Edward, King of England.
	Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
	This blot that they object against your house
	Shall be wip'd out in the next parliament,
	Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;
	And if thou be not then created York,
	I will not live to be accounted Warwick.
	Meantime in signal of my love to thee,
	Against proud Somerset and William Pole,
	Will I upon thy party wear this rose.
	And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,
	Grown to this faction in the Temple garden,
	Shall send between the red rose and the white
	A thousand souls to death and deadly night.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Roam thither then.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Ay, see the bishop be not overborne.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Methinks his lordship should be humbler;
	It fitteth not a prelate so to plead.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	State holy, or unhallow'd, what of that?
	Is not his Grace protector to the king?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	An uproar, I dare warrant,
	Begun through malice of the bishop's men.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Yield, my Lord Protector; yield, Winchester;
	Except you mean with obstinate repulse
	To slay your sov'reign and destroy the realm.
	You see what mischief and what murder too
	Hath been enacted through your enmity:
	Then be at peace, except ye thirst for blood.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the duke
	Hath banish'd moody discontented fury,
	As by his smoothed brows it doth appear:
	Why look you still so stern and tragical?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	Sweet king! the bishop hath a kindly gird.
	For shame, my Lord of Winchester, relent!
	What! shall a child instruct you what to do?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	Accept this scroll, most gracious sovereign,
	Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet
	We do exhibit to your majesty.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Let Richard be restored to his blood;
	So shall his father's wrongs be recompens'd.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	My Lord of York, I promise you, the king Prettily, methought, did play the orator.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
	Tush! that was but his fancy, blame him not;
	I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 4><91%>
	Graceless! wilt thou deny thy parentage?
<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 4><92%>
	And hark ye, sirs; because she is a maid,
	Spare for no fagots, let there be enow:
	Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake,
	That so her torture may be shortened.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 4><93%>
	The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought!
	Is all your strict preciseness come to this?
<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 4><93%>
	Well, go to; we will have no bastards live;
	Especially since Charles must father it.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 4><93%>
	A married man: that's most intolerable.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 4><93%>
	It's sign she hath been liberal and free.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 4><94%>
	Be patient, York: if we conclude a peace,
	It shall be with such strict and severe covenants
	As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 4><96%>
	How sayst thou, Charles? shall our condition stand?
