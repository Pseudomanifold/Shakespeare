	Sirrah, thou know'st how Orleans is besieg'd,
	And how the English have the suburbs won.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 4><16%>
	But now thou shalt not. Be thou rul'd by me:
	Chief master-gunner am I of this town;
	Something I must do to procure me grace.
	The prince's espials have informed me
	How the English, in the suburbs close entrench'd,
	Wont through a secret gate of iron bars
	In yonder tower to overpeer the city,
	And thence discover how with most advantage
	They may vex us with shot or with assault.
	To intercept this inconvenience,
	A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have plac'd;
	And fully even these three days have I watch'd
	If I could see them. Now, boy, do thou watch,
	For I can stay no longer.
	If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word;
	And thou shalt find me at the Governor's.
