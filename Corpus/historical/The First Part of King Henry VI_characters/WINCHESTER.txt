	He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.
	Unto the French the dreadful judgment-day
	So dreadful will not be as was his sight.
	The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:
	The church's prayers made him so prosperous.

	Gloucester, whate'er we like thou art protector,
	And lookest to command the prince and realm.
	Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,
	More than God or religious churchmen may.

	Each hath his place and function to attend:
	I am left out; for me nothing remains.
	But long I will not be Jack-out-of-office.
	The king from Eltham I intend to steal,

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 3><13%>
	How now, ambitious Humphrey! what means this?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	I do, thou most usurping proditor,
	And not protector, of the king or realm.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	Nay, stand thou back; I will not budge a foot:
	This be Damascus, be thou cursed Cam,
	To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt.

	Do what thou dar'st; I'll beard thee to thy face.

	Here's Gloucester, a foe to citizens;
	One that still motions war and never peace,
	O'ercharging your free purses with large fines,
	That seeks to overthrow religion
	Because he is protector of the realm,
	And would have armour here out of the Tower,
	To crown himself king and suppress the prince.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	Gloucester, we will meet; to thy cost, be sure:
	Thy heart-blood I will have for this day's work.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	Abominable Gloucester! guard thy head;
	For I intend to have it ere long.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	Com'st thou with deep premeditated lines,
	With written pamphlets studiously devis'd,
	Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse,
	Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,
	Do it without invention, suddenly;
	As I, with sudden and extemporal speech
	Purpose to answer what thou canst object.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe
	To give me hearing what I shall reply.
	If I were covetous, ambitious, or perverse,
	As he will have me, how am I so poor?
	Or how haps it I seek not to advance
	Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?
	And for dissension, who preferreth peace
	More than I do, except I be provok'd?
	No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
	It is not that that hath incens'd the duke:
	It is, because no one should sway but he;
	No one but he should be about the king;
	And that engenders thunder in his breast,
	And makes him roar these accusations forth.
	But he shall know I am as goodâ€”
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray,
	But one imperious in another's throne?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	And am not I a prelate of the church?

	He shall submit or I will never yield.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee;
	Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.

	Stay, my lord legate: you shall first receive
	The sum of money which I promised
	Should be deliver'd to his holiness
	For clothing me in these grave ornaments.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	</STAGE DIR> Now Winchester will not submit, I trow,
	Or be inferior to the proudest peer.
	Humphrey of Gloucester, thou shalt well perceive
	That neither in birth or for authority
	The bishop will be overborne by thee:
	I'll either make thee stoop and bend thy knee,
	Or sack this country with a mutiny.
