	Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 4><32%>
	And on my side it is so well apparell'd,
	So clear, so shining, and so evident,
	That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
	Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,
	But dare maintain the party of the truth,
	Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
	Good Master Vernon, it is well objected:
	If I have fewest I subscribe in silence.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
	Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,
	Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red,
	And fall on my side so, against your will.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	Well, well, come on: who else?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	Here, in my scabbard; meditating that
	Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	No, Plantagenet,
	'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
	Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,
	And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,
	That shall maintain what I have said is true,
	Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	Away, away! good William de la Pole:
	We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
	By Him that made me, I'll maintain my words
	On any plot of ground in Christendom.
	Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,
	For treason executed in our late king's days?
	And, by his treason stand'st not thou attainted,
	Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?
	His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood;
	And, till thou be restor'd, thou art a yeoman.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
	Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still,
	And know us by these colours for thy foes;
	For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
	Have with thee, Pole. Farewell, ambitious Richard.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	My lord, it were your duty to forbear.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Methinks my lord should be religious,
	And know the office that belongs to such.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	</STAGE DIR> Perish, base prince, ignoble Duke of York!
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	And this is mine: sweet Henry, favour him!
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,
	Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;
	Betwixt ourselves let us decide it, then.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 4><70%>
	It is too late; I cannot send them now:
	This expedition was by York and Talbot
	Too rashly plotted: all our general force
	Might with a sally of the very town
	Be buckled with: the over-daring Talbot
	Hath sullied all his gloss of former honour
	By this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure:
	York set him on to fight and die in shame,
	That, Talbot dead, great York might bear the name.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 4><71%>
	How now, Sir William! whither were you sent?
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 4><71%>
	York set him on; York should have sent him aid.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 4><71%>
	York lies; he might have sent and had the horse:
	I owe him little duty, and less love;
	And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 4><72%>
	Come, go; I will dispatch the horsemen straight:
	Within six hours they will be at his aid.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 4><72%>
	If he be dead, brave Talbot, then adieu!
