	No, boy.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
	My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
	I do lament the sickness of the king,
	As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
	It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
	Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:
	Incapable and shallow innocents,
	You cannot guess who caus'd your father's death.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
	Ah! that deceit should steal such gentle shape,
	And with a virtuous vizard hide deep vice.
	He is my son, ay, and therein my shame,
	Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
	Ay, boy.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
	What means this scene of rude impatience?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
	Ah! so much interest have I in thy sorrow
	As I had title in thy noble husband.
	I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
	And liv'd with looking on his images;
	But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
	Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
	And I for comfort have but one false glass,
	That grieves me when I see my shame in him.
	Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,
	And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:
	But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,
	And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,
	Clarence and Edward. O! what cause have I—
	Thine being but a moiety of my grief—
	To overgo thy plaints, and drown thy cries!
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
	Alas! for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
	What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
	Was never mother had so dear a loss.
	Alas! I am the mother of these griefs:
	Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.
	She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;
	I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:
	These babes for Clarence weep, and so do I;
	I for an Edward weep, so do not they:
	Alas! you three, on me, threefold distress'd,
	Pour all your tears; I am your sorrow's nurse,
	And I will pamper it with lamentation.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
	God bless thee! and put meekness in thy mind,
	Love, charity, obedience, and true duty.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
	I long with all my heart to see the prince.
	I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
	Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
	Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
	In him that did object the same to thee:
	He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
	So long a-growing, and so leisurely,
	That, if his rule were true, he should be gracious.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	How, my young York? I prithee, let me hear it.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wast born.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	What is thy news?
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	Who hath committed them?
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
	How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
	My husband lost his life to get the crown,
	And often up and down my sons were toss'd,
	For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
	And being seated, and domestic broils
	Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors,
	Make war upon themselves; brother to brother,
	Blood to blood, self against self: O! preposterous
	And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
	Or let me die, to look on death no more.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 4><40%>
	Stay, I will go with you.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	Who meets us here? my niece Plantagenet,
	Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
	Now, for my life, she's wand'ring to the Tower,
	On pure heart's love, to greet the tender princes.
	Daughter, well met.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	I am their father's mother; I will see them.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
	O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
	O! my accursed womb, the bed of death,
	A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
	Whose unavoided eye is murderous!
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	</STAGE DIR> Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee!
	</STAGE DIR> Go thou to Richard, and good angels tend thee!
	</STAGE DIR> Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee!
	I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!
	Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
	And each hour's joy wrack'd with a week of teen.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 4><71%>
	So many miseries have craz'd my voice,
	That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute.
	Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 4><72%>
	Dead life, blind sight, poor mortal living ghost,
	Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
	Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
	Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
	Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood!
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 4><72%>
	I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
	I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 4><72%>
	O! Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes:
	God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 4><74%>
	Why should calamity be full of words?
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 4><74%>
	If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me,
	And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
	My damned son, that thy two sweet sons smother'd.
	The trumpet sounds: be copious in exclaims.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 4><74%>
	O! she that might have intercepted thee,
	By strangling thee in her accursed womb,
	From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence
	And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	Where is kind Hastings?
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	Art thou my son?
<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	Then patiently hear my impatience.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	O, let me speak!
<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	I will be mild and gentle in my words.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
	God knows, in torment and in agony.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
	Thou cam'st on earth to make the earth my hell.
	A grievous burden was thy birth to me;
	Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
	Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild and furious;
	Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous;
	Thy age confirm'd, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody,
	More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:
	What comfortable hour canst thou name
	That ever grac'd me in thy company?
<SPEECH 42><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
	I prithee, hear me speak.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
	Hear me a word;
	For I shall never speak to thee again.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
	Either thou wilt die by God's just ordinance,
	Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror;
	Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
	And never look upon thy face again.
	Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse,
	Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more
	Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
	My prayers on the adverse party fight;
	And there the little souls of Edward's children
	Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
	And promise them success and victory.
	Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
	Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.
