	First, he commends him to your noble self.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
	Then certifies your lordship, that this night
	He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm:
	Besides, he says there are two councils held;
	And that may be determin'd at the one
	Which may make you and him to rue at the other.
	Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,
	If you will presently take horse with him,
	And with all speed post with him towards the north,
	To shun the danger that his soul divines.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
	I'll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,
	As I by friends am well advertised,
	Sir Edward Courtney, and the haughty prelate,
	Bishop of Exeter, his brother there,
	With many moe confederates are in arms.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
	My lord, he doth deny to come.
