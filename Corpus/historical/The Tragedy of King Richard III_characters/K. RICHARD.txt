	Stand all apart. Cousin of Buckingham.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Give me thy hand. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Thus high, by thy advice,
	And thy assistance, is King Richard seated:
	But shall we wear these glories for a day?
	Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Ah! Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
	To try if thou be current gold indeed:
	Young Edward lives: think now what I would speak.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Ha! am I king? 'Tis so: but Edward lives.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	O bitter consequence,
	That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!'
	Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull:
	Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;
	And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
	What sayst thou now? speak suddenly, be brief.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Tut, tut! thou art all ice, thy kindness freezes:
	Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	</STAGE DIR> I will converse with iron-witted fools
	And unrespective boys: none are for me
	That look into me with considerate eyes.
	High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
	Boy!
<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
	Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	What is his name?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	I partly know the man: go, call him hither.
	The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
	No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel.
	Hath he so long held out with me untir'd,
	And stops he now for breath? well, be it so.
	How now, Lord Stanley! what's the news?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	Come hither, Catesby: rumour it abroad,
	That Anne my wife is very grievous sick;
	I will take order for her keeping close.
	Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman,
	Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter:
	The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
	Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
	That Anne my queen is sick, and like to die:
	About it; for it stands me much upon,
	To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
	I must be married to my brother's daughter,
	Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
	Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
	Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
	So far in blood, that sin will pluck on sin:
	Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
	Is thy name Tyrrell?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Art thou, indeed?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Dar'st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Why, then thou hast it: two deep enemies,
	Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep's disturbers,
	Are they that I would have thee deal upon.
	Tyrrell, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrell:
	Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear.
	There is no more but so: say it is done,
	And I will love thee, and prefer thee for it.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Well, let that rest. Dorset is fled to Richmond.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Stanley, he is your wife's son: well, look to it.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Stanley, look to your wife: if she convey
	Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	I do remember me, Henry the Sixth
	Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
	When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
	A king! perhaps—
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
	How chance the prophet could not at that time
	Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
	Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
	The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,
	And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,
	Because a bard of Ireland told me once
	I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
	Ay, what's o'clock?
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
	Well, but what is't o'clock?
<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
	Well, let it strike.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
	Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke
	Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
	I am not in the giving vein to-day.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
	Thou troublest me: I am not in the vein.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	Kind Tyrrell, am I happy in thy news?
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	But didst thou see them dead?
<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	And buried, gentle Tyrrell?
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	Come to me, Tyrrell, soon at after-supper,
	When thou shalt tell the process of their death.
	Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
	And be inheritor of thy desire.
	Farewell till then.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
	His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
	The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
	And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.
	Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
	At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
	And, by that knot, looks proudly on the crown,
	To her go I, a jolly thriving wooer.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	Good or bad news, that thou com'st in so bluntly?
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
	Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
	Than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength.
	Come; I have learn'd that fearful commenting
	Is leaden servitor to dull delay:
	Delay leads impotent and snail-pac'd beggary:
	Then fiery expedition be my wing,
	Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
	Go, muster men: my counsel is my shield;
	We must be brief when traitors brave the field.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 4><74%>
	Who intercepts me in my expedition?
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
	Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
	Rail on the Lord's anointed. Strike, I say!
	Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
	Or with the clamorous report of war
	Thus will I drown your exclamations.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	Ay; I thank God, my father, and yourself.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	Madam, I have a touch of your condition,
	That cannot brook the accent of reproof.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	Do, then; but I'll not hear.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	And came I not at last to comfort you?
<SPEECH 42><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
	Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd your Grace
	To breakfast once forth of my company.
	If I be so disgracious in your eye,
	Let me march on, and not offend you, madam.
	Strike up the drum!
<SPEECH 43><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
	You speak too bitterly.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
	So!
<SPEECH 45><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
	Stay, madam; I must talk a word with you.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
	You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,
	Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 4><SCENE 4><77%>
	Wrong not her birth; she is of royal blood.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 4><SCENE 4><77%>
	Her life is safest only in her birth.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 4><SCENE 4><77%>
	Lo! at their births good stars were opposite!
<SPEECH 50><ACT 4><SCENE 4><77%>
	All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 4><SCENE 4><77%>
	You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 4><SCENE 4><77%>
	Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
	And dangerous success of bloody wars,
	As I intend more good to you and yours
	Than ever you or yours by me were harm'd.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 4><SCENE 4><77%>
	The advancement of your children, gentle lady.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 4><SCENE 4><77%>
	No, to the dignity and height of fortune,
	The high imperial type of this earth's glory.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 4><SCENE 4><78%>
	Even all I have; ay, and myself and all,
	Will I withal endow a child of thine;
	So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
	Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
	Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 4><SCENE 4><78%>
	Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 4><SCENE 4><78%>
	What do you think?
<SPEECH 58><ACT 4><SCENE 4><78%>
	Be not too hasty to confound my meaning:
	I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,
	And do intend to make her Queen of England.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 4><SCENE 4><78%>
	Even he that makes her queen: who else should be?
<SPEECH 60><ACT 4><SCENE 4><78%>
	Even so: what think you of it?
<SPEECH 61><ACT 4><SCENE 4><78%>
	That I would learn of you,
	As one being best acquainted with her humour.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 4><SCENE 4><78%>
	Madam, with all my heart.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 4><SCENE 4><79%>
	You mock me, madam; this is not the way
	To win your daughter.
<SPEECH 64><ACT 4><SCENE 4><79%>
	Say, that I did all this for love of her?
<SPEECH 65><ACT 4><SCENE 4><79%>
	Look, what is done cannot be now amended:
	Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
	Which after-hours give leisure to repent.
	If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
	To make amends I'll give it to your daughter.
	If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
	To quicken your increase, I will beget
	Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter:
	A grandam's name is little less in love
	Than is the doting title of a mother;
	They are as children but one step below,
	Even of your mettle, of your very blood;
	Of all one pain, save for a night of groans
	Endur'd of her for whom you bid like sorrow.
	Your children were vexation to your youth,
	But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
	The loss you have is but a son being king,
	And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
	I cannot make you what amends I would,
	Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
	Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
	Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
	This fair alliance quickly shall call home
	To high promotions and great dignity:
	The king that calls your beauteous daughter wife,
	Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
	Again shall you be mother to a king,
	And all the ruins of distressful times
	Repair'd with double riches of content.
	What! we have many goodly days to see:
	The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
	Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
	Advantaging their loan with interest
	Of ten times double gain of happiness.
	Go then, my mother; to thy daughter go:
	Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
	Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale;
	Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
	Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess
	With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys:
	And when this arm of mine hath chastised
	The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
	Bound with triumphant garlands will I come,
	And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
	To whom I will retail my conquest won,
	And she shall be sole victress, Cæsar's Cæsar.
<SPEECH 66><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>
	Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
<SPEECH 67><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>
	Tell her, the king, that may command, entreats.
<SPEECH 68><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>
	Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.

<SPEECH 73><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>
	Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
<SPEECH 74><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>
	Then plainly to her tell my loving tale.
<SPEECH 75><ACT 4><SCENE 4><81%>
	Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
<SPEECH 76><ACT 4><SCENE 4><81%>
	Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
<SPEECH 77><ACT 4><SCENE 4><81%>
	Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,—
<SPEECH 78><ACT 4><SCENE 4><81%>
	I swear,—
<SPEECH 79><ACT 4><SCENE 4><81%>
	Now, by the world,—
<SPEECH 80><ACT 4><SCENE 4><81%>
	My father's death,—
<SPEECH 81><ACT 4><SCENE 4><81%>
	Then, by myself,—
<SPEECH 82><ACT 4><SCENE 4><81%>
	Why, then, by God,—
<SPEECH 83><ACT 4><SCENE 4><81%>
	The time to come.
<SPEECH 84><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	As I intend to prosper, and repent,
	So thrive I in my dangerous affairs
	Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
	Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
	Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
	Be opposite all planets of good luck
	To my proceeding, if, with pure heart's love,
	Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
	I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!
	In her consists my happiness and thine;
	Without her, follows to myself, and thee,
	Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul,
	Death, desolation, ruin, and decay:
	It cannot be avoided but by this;
	It will not be avoided but by this.
	Therefore, dear mother,—I must call you so,—
	Be the attorney of my love to her:
	Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
	Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
	Urge the necessity and state of times,
	And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
<SPEECH 85><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.
<SPEECH 86><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	Ay, if your self's remembrance wrong yourself.
<SPEECH 87><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	But in your daughter's womb I bury them:
	Where, in that nest of spicery, they shall breed
	Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.
<SPEECH 88><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	And be a happy mother by the deed.
<SPEECH 89><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	Bear her my true love's kiss; and so farewell.

	How now! what news?
<SPEECH 90><ACT 4><SCENE 4><83%>
	Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:
	Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?
<SPEECH 91><ACT 4><SCENE 4><83%>
	Catesby, fly to the duke.
<SPEECH 92><ACT 4><SCENE 4><83%>
	Ratcliff, come hither. Post to Salisbury:
	When thou com'st thither,—<STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Dull, unmindful villain,
	Why stay'st thou here, and go'st not to the duke?
<SPEECH 93><ACT 4><SCENE 4><83%>
	O! true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight
	The greatest strength and power he can make,
	And meet me suddenly at Salisbury.
<SPEECH 94><ACT 4><SCENE 4><83%>
	Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?
<SPEECH 95><ACT 4><SCENE 4><83%>
	My mind is chang'd. Stanley, what news with you?
<SPEECH 96><ACT 4><SCENE 4><83%>
	Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
	What need'st thou run so many miles about,
	When thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way?
	Once more, what news?
<SPEECH 97><ACT 4><SCENE 4><83%>
	There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
	White-liver'd runagate! what doth he there?
<SPEECH 98><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	Well, as you guess?
<SPEECH 99><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?
	Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?
	What heir of York is there alive but we?
	And who is England's king but great York's heir?
	Then, tell me, what makes he upon the seas?
<SPEECH 100><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
	You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
	Thou wilt revolt and fly to him I fear.

	Where is thy power then to beat him back?

	Ay, ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:

	Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,

	Who hath descried the number of the traitors?
<SPEECH 113><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
	Why, our battalia trebles that account;
	Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength,
	Which they upon the adverse faction want.
	Up with the tent! Come, noble gentlemen,
	Let us survey the vantage of the ground;
	Call for some men of sound direction:
	Let's lack no discipline, make no delay;
	For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.
<SPEECH 114><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	What is 't o'clock?
<SPEECH 115><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>

	Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
	Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
	Ratcliff!
<SPEECH 120><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?
<SPEECH 121><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:

	Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?
<SPEECH 122><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	Bid my guard watch; leave me.
	Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent

	Give me another horse! bind up my wounds!
	Have mercy, Jesu! Soft! I did but dream.
	O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
	The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
	Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
	What! do I fear myself? there's none else by:
	Richard loves Richard, that is, I am I.
	Is there a murderer here? No. Yes, I am:
	Then fly: what! from myself? Great reason why:
	Lest I revenge. What! myself upon myself?
	Alack! I love myself. Wherefore? for any good
	That I myself have done unto myself?
	O! no: alas! I rather hate myself
	For hateful deeds committed by myself.
	I am a villain. Yet I lie; I am not.
	Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.
	My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
	And every tongue brings in a several tale,
	And every tale condemns me for a villain.
	Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree:
	Murder, stern murder, in the dir'st degree;
	All several sins, all us'd in each degree,
	Throng to the bar, crying all, 'Guilty! guilty!'
	I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
	And if I die, no soul will pity me:
	Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself
	Find in myself no pity to myself?
	Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
	Came to my tent; and every one did threat
	To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.

	'Zounds! who's there?

<SPEECH 127><ACT 5><SCENE 3><95%>
	By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
	Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
	Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
	Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.
	It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;
	Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
	To hear if any mean to shrink from me.
<SPEECH 128><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
	What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?
<SPEECH 129><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
	He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?
<SPEECH 130><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
	He was i' the right; and so, indeed, it is.
	Tell the clock there. Give me a calendar.
	Who saw the sun to-day?
<SPEECH 131><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
	Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
	He should have brav'd the east an hour ago:
	A black day will it be to somebody.
	Ratcliff!
<SPEECH 132><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
	The sun will not be seen to-day;
	The sky doth frown and lower upon our army.
	I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
	Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
	More than to Richmond? for the self-same heaven
	That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.
<SPEECH 133><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse.
	Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:
	I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
	And thus my battle shall be ordered:
	My foreward shall be drawn out all in length
	Consisting equally of horse and foot;
	Our archers shall be placed in the midst:
	John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
	Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
	They thus directed, we will follow
	In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
	Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
	This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?
<SPEECH 134><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	Jockey of Norfolk, be not too bold,
	For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.
	A thing devised by the enemy.
	Go, gentlemen; every man to his charge:
	Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls;
	Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
	Devis'd at first to keep the strong in awe:
	Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.
	March on, join bravely, let us to 't pell-mell;
	If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.
	His oration to his Army.
	What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?
	Remember whom you are to cope withal:
	A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and run-aways,
	A scum of Bretons and base lackey peasants,
	Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth
	To desperate adventures and assur'd destruction.
	You sleeping safe, they bring you to unrest;
	You having lands, and bless'd with beauteous wives,
	They would restrain the one, distain the other.
	And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
	Long kept in Britaine at our mother's cost?
	A milksop, one that never in his life
	Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
	Let's whip these stragglers o'er the sea again;
	Lash hence these overweening rags of France,
	These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
	Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,
	For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves:
	If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,
	And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers
	Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,
	And, on record, left them the heirs of shame.
	Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives?
	Ravish our daughters?
	Hark! I hear their drum.
	Fight, gentlemen of England! fight, bold yeomen!
	Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!
	Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;
	Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!
	What says Lord Stanley? will he bring his power?
<SPEECH 135><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
	Off with his son George's head!
<SPEECH 136><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
	A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:
	Advance our standards! set upon our foes!
	Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
	Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
	Upon them! Victory sits upon our helms.
<SPEECH 137><ACT 5><SCENE 4><99%>
	A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
<SPEECH 138><ACT 5><SCENE 4><99%>
	Slave! I have set my life upon a cast,
	And I will stand the hazard of the die.
	I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
	Five have I slain to-day, instead of him.—
	A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
