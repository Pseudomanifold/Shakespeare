<SPEECH 1><ACT 1><SCENE 1><0%>
	Now is the winter of our discontent
	Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
	And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
	In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
	Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
	Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
	Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings;
	Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
	Grim-visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
	And now,—instead of mounting barbed steeds,
	To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,—
	He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
	To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
	But I, that am not shap'd for sportive tricks,
	Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
	I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
	To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
	I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
	Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
	Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time
	Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
	And that so lamely and unfashionable
	That dogs bark at me, as I halt by them;
	Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
	Have no delight to pass away the time,
	Unless to see my shadow in the sun
	And descant on mine own deformity:
	And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
	To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
	I am determined to prove a villain,
	And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
	Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
	By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,
	To set my brother Clarence and the king
	In deadly hate the one against the other:
	And if King Edward be as true and just
	As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,
	This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
	About a prophecy, which says, that G
	Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
	Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here Clarence comes.
	Brother, good day: what means this armed guard
	That waits upon your Grace?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	Upon what cause?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	Alack! my lord, that fault is none of yours;
	He should, for that, commit your godfathers.
	O! belike his majesty hath some intent
	That you should be new-christen'd in the Tower.
	But what's the matter, Clarence? may I know?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Why, this it is, when men are rul'd by women:
	'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower;
	My Lady Grey, his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
	That tempers him to this extremity.
	Was it not she and that good man of worship,
	Antony Woodville, her brother there,
	That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
	From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
	We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Humbly complaining to her deity
	Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
	I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,
	If we will keep in favour with the king,
	To be her men and wear her livery:
	The jealous o'er-worn widow and herself,
	Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen,
	Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Even so; an please your worship, Brakenbury,
	You may partake of anything we say:
	We speak no treason, man: we say the king
	Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
	Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
	We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
	A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
	And that the queen's kindred are made gentlefolks.
	How say you, sir? can you deny all this?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Naught to do with Mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
	He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
	Were best to do it secretly, alone.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Her husband, knave. Wouldst thou betray me?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
	Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
	And whatsoe'er you will employ me in,
	Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,
	I will perform it to enfranchise you.
	Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
	Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
	I will deliver you, or else lie for you:
	Meantime, have patience.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return,
	Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so
	That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
	If heaven will take the present at our hands.
	But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings!
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
	Well are you welcome to this open air.
	How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
	For they that were your enemies are his,
	And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	What news abroad?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Now by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
	O! he hath kept an evil diet long,
	And over-much consum'd his royal person:
	'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
	What, is he in his bed?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Go you before, and I will follow you.
	He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
	Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
	I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
	With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
	And, if I fail not in my deep intent,
	Clarence hath not another day to live:
	Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
	And leave the world for me to bustle in!
	For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
	What though I kill'd her husband and her father,
	The readiest way to make the wench amends
	Is to become her husband and her father:
	The which will I; not all so much for love
	As for another secret close intent,
	By marrying her, which I must reach unto.
	But yet I run before my horse to market:
	Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
	When they are gone, then must I count my gains.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 2><5%>
	Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 2><5%>
	Villains! set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
	I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 2><5%>
	Unmanner'd dog! stand thou when I command:
	Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,
	Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
	And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 2><6%>
	Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 2><6%>
	Lady, you know no rules of charity,
	Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 2><6%>
	But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 2><6%>
	More wonderful when angels are so angry.
	Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
	Of these supposed evils, to give me leave,
	By circumstance, but to acquit myself.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
	Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	By such despair I should accuse myself.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	Say that I slew them not.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	I did not kill your husband.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	I was provoked by her sland'rous tongue,
	That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	I grant ye.

	The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	Let him thank me, that help'd to send him thither;
	For he was fitter for that place than earth.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	Yes, one place else, if you will bear me name it.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	Your bed-chamber.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	So will it, madam, till I lie with you.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
	To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
	And fall somewhat into a slower method,
	Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
	Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
	As blameful as the executioner?
<SPEECH 37><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
	Your beauty, that did haunt me in my sleep
	To undertake the death of all the world,
	So might I live one hour in your sweet bosom.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	These eyes could not endure that beauty's wrack;
	You should not blemish it if I stood by:
	As all the world is cheered by the sun,
	So I by that; it is my day, my life.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	It is a quarrel most unnatural,
	To be reveng'd on him that loveth thee.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
	Did it to help thee to a better husband.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	He lives that loves thee better than he could.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	Plantagenet.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	The self-same name, but one of better nature.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	Here. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Why dost thou spit at me?
<SPEECH 46><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	Never came poison from so sweet a place.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	I would they were, that I might die at once;
	For now they kill me with a living death.
	Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
	Sham'd their aspects with store of childish drops;
	These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear;
	No, when my father York and Edward wept
	To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
	When black-fac'd Clifford shook his sword at him;
	Nor when thy war-like father like a child,
	Told the sad story of my father's death,
	And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
	That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks,
	Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time,
	My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
	And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
	Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
	I never su'd to friend, nor enemy;
	My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing words;
	But, now thy beauty is propos'd my fee,
	My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
	Teach not thy lip such scorn, for it was made
	For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
	If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
	Lo! here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
	Which if thou please to hide in this true breast,
	And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
	I lay it open to the deadly stroke,
	And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
	Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry;
	But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
	Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward;
	But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
	Take up the sword again, or take up me.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	That was in thy rage:
	Speak it again, and, even with the word,
	This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,
	Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love:
	To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	'Tis figur'd in my tongue.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	Then never man was true.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	Say, then, my peace is made.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	But shall I live in hope?
<SPEECH 55><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	Look, how my ring encompasseth thy finger,
	Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
	Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
	And if thy poor devoted servant may
	But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
	Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	That it may please you leave these sad designs
	To him that hath most cause to be a mourner,
	And presently repair to Crosby-place;
	Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
	At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
	And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
	I will with all expedient duty see you:
	For divers unknown reasons, I beseech you,
	Grant me this boon.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	Bid me farewell.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	Sirs, take up the corse.
<SPEECH 60><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	No, to White-Friars; there attend my coming.
	Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
	Was ever woman in this humour won?
	I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
	What! I, that kill'd her husband, and his father,
	To take her in her heart's extremest hate;
	With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
	The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
	Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me,
	And nothing I to back my suit withal
	But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
	And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
	Ha!
	Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
	Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
	Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
	A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
	Fram'd in the prodigality of nature,
	Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
	The spacious world cannot again afford:
	And will she yet abase her eyes on me,
	That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
	And made her widow to a woeful bed?
	On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
	On me, that halt and am misshapen thus?
	My dukedom to a beggarly denier
	I do mistake my person all this while:
	Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
	Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
	I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
	And entertain a score or two of tailors,
	To study fashions to adorn my body:
	Since I am crept in favour with myself,
	I will maintain it with some little cost.
	But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave,
	And then return lamenting to my love.
	Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
	That I may see my shadow as I pass.
<SPEECH 61><ACT 1><SCENE 3><13%>
	They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:
	Who are they that complain unto the king,
	That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?
	By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly
	That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
	Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
	Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive, and cog,
	Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
	I must be held a rancorous enemy.
	Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
	But thus his simple truth must be abus'd
	By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
<SPEECH 62><ACT 1><SCENE 3><13%>
	To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
	When have I injur'd thee? when done thee wrong?
	Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
	A plague upon you all! His royal person,—
	Whom God preserve better than you would wish!—
	Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
	But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	I cannot tell; the world is grown so bad
	That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
	Since every Jack became a gentleman
	There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
<SPEECH 64><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:
	Our brother is imprison'd by your means,
	Myself disgrac'd, and the nobility
	Held in contempt; while great promotions
	Are daily given to ennoble those
	That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.
<SPEECH 65><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	You may deny that you were not the mean
	Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
<SPEECH 66><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
	She may do more, sir, than denying that:
	She may help you to many fair preferments,
	And then deny her aiding hand therein,
	And lay those honours on your high deserts.
	What may she not? She may,—ay, marry, may she,—
<SPEECH 67><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
	A bachelor, a handsome stripling too.
	I wis your grandam had a worser match.
<SPEECH 68><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	What! threat you me with telling of the king?
	Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said
	I will avouch in presence of the king:
	I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
	'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.
<SPEECH 69><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	Ere you were queen, ay, or your husband king,
	I was a pack-horse in his great affairs,

<SPEECH 70><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	In all which time you and your husband Grey

	Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
<SPEECH 71><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick,

	What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?

	Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.
	I was too hot to do somebody good,

	God pardon them that are the cause thereof!

	So do I ever <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> being well-advis'd;
	For had I curs'd now, I had curs'd myself.
<SPEECH 88><ACT 1><SCENE 3><20%>
	I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
	The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
	I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
	Clarence, whom I, indeed, have cast in darkness,
	I do beweep to many simple gulls;
	Namely, to Stanley, Hastings, Buckingham;
	And tell them 'tis the queen and her allies
	That stir the king against the duke my brother.
	Now they believe it; and withal whet me
	To be reveng'd on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey;
	But then I sigh, and, with a piece of scripture,
	Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
	And thus I clothe my naked villany
	With odd old ends stol'n forth of holy writ,
	And seem a saint when most I play the devil.
	But soft! here come my executioners.
	How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!
	Are you now going to dispatch this thing?
<SPEECH 89><ACT 1><SCENE 3><21%>
	Well thought upon; I have it here about me:
	When you have done, repair to Crosby-place.
	But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
	Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
	For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
	May move your hearts to pity, if you mark him.

	Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen;
	And princely peers, a happy time of day!
<SPEECH 92><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
	A blessed labour, my most sovereign lord.
	Among this princely heap, if any here,
	By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,
	Hold me a foe;
	If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
	Have aught committed that is hardly borne
	By any in this presence, I desire
	To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
	'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
	I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
	First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
	Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
	Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
	If ever any grudge were lodg'd between us;
	Of you, Lord Rivers, and Lord Grey, of you,
	That all without desert have frown'd on me;
	Of you, Lord Woodvile, and Lord Scales, of you;
	Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
	I do not know that Englishman alive
	With whom my soul is any jot at odds

	I thank my God for my humility.
<SPEECH 93><ACT 2><SCENE 1><31%>
	Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this,
	To be so flouted in this royal presence?
	Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead?
	You do him injury to scorn his corse.
<SPEECH 94><ACT 2><SCENE 1><31%>
	But he, poor man, by your first order died,
	And that a winged Mercury did bear;
	Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,
	That came too lag to see him buried.
	God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
	Nearer in bloody thoughts, and not in blood,
	Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
	And yet go current from suspicion.
<SPEECH 95><ACT 2><SCENE 1><32%>
	This is the fruit of rashness. Mark'd you not
	How that the guilty kindred of the queen
	Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
	O! they did urge it still unto the king:
	God will revenge it. Come, lords; will you go
	To comfort Edward with our company?
<SPEECH 96><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
	Sister, have comfort: all of us have cause
	To wail the dimming of our shining star;
	But none can cure their harms by wailing them.
	Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
	I did not see your Grace: humbly on my knee
	I crave your blessing.
<SPEECH 97><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
	Amen; <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> and make me die a good old man!
	That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing;
	I marvel that her Grace did leave it out.
<SPEECH 98><ACT 2><SCENE 2><36%>
	I hope the king made peace with all of us;
	And the compact is firm and true in me.
<SPEECH 99><ACT 2><SCENE 2><36%>
	Then be it so; and go we to determine
	Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
	Madam, and you my mother, will you go
	To give your censures in this business?
<SPEECH 100><ACT 2><SCENE 2><36%>
	My other self, my counsel's consistory,
	My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,
	I, as a child, will go by thy direction.
	Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.
<SPEECH 101><ACT 3><SCENE 1><40%>
	Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign;
	The weary way hath made you melancholy.
<SPEECH 102><ACT 3><SCENE 1><40%>
	Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
	Hath not yet div'd into the world's deceit:
	No more can you distinguish of a man
	Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,
	Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
	Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
	Your Grace attended to their sugar'd words,
	But look'd not on the poison of their hearts:
	God keep you from them, and from such false friends!
<SPEECH 103><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet you.
<SPEECH 104><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	Where it seems best unto your royal self.
	If I may counsel you, some day or two
	Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:
	Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
	For your best health and recreation.
<SPEECH 105><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>

<SPEECH 108><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
<SPEECH 109><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	He hath, my lord.
<SPEECH 110><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
<SPEECH 111><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	He may command me as my sovereign;
	But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
<SPEECH 112><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.
<SPEECH 113><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
<SPEECH 114><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.
<SPEECH 115><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	It is too weighty for your Grace to wear.
<SPEECH 116><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	What! would you have my weapon, little lord?
<SPEECH 117><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	How?
<SPEECH 118><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	My lord, will't please you pass along?
	Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
	Will to your mother, to entreat of her
	To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
<SPEECH 119><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	Why, what would you fear?
<SPEECH 120><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	Nor none that live, I hope.
<SPEECH 121><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	No doubt, no doubt: O! 'tis a parlous boy;

	He's all the mother's, from the top to toe.
<SPEECH 122><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
	His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
	To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle;
	And bid my lord, for joy of this good news,
	Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.
<SPEECH 123><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
<SPEECH 124><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	At Crosby-place, there shall you find us both.
<SPEECH 125><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Chop off his head; something we will determine:
	And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me
	The earldom of Hereford, and all the moveables
	Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.
<SPEECH 126><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	And look to have it yielded with all kindness.
	Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
	We may digest our complots in some form.
<SPEECH 127><ACT 3><SCENE 4><51%>
	My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
	I have been long a sleeper; but, I trust,
	My absence doth neglect no great design,
	Which by my presence might have been concluded.
<SPEECH 128><ACT 3><SCENE 4><51%>
	Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder:
	His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.
	My Lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn,
	I saw good strawberries in your garden there;
	I do beseech you send for some of them.
<SPEECH 129><ACT 3><SCENE 4><51%>
	Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
	Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
	And finds the testy gentleman so hot,
	That he will lose his head ere give consent
	His master's child, as worshipfully he terms it,
	Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.
<SPEECH 130><ACT 3><SCENE 4><52%>
	I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
	That do conspire my death with devilish plots
	Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
	Upon my body with their hellish charms?
<SPEECH 131><ACT 3><SCENE 4><52%>
	Then be your eyes the witness of their evil.
	Look how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm
	Is like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:
	And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch
	Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
	That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.
<SPEECH 132><ACT 3><SCENE 4><52%>
	If! thou protector of this damned strumpet,
	Talk'st thou to me of ifs? Thou art a traitor:
	Off with his head! now, by Saint Paul, I swear,
	I will not dine until I see the same.
	Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:
	The rest, that love me, rise, and follow me.
<SPEECH 133><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>
	Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,
	Murder thy breath in middle of a word,
	And then again begin, and stop again,
	As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?
<SPEECH 134><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>
	He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.
<SPEECH 135><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>

	Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.
<SPEECH 139><ACT 3><SCENE 5><54%>
	So dear I lov'd the man, that I must weep.
	I took him for the plainest harmless creature
	That breath'd upon the earth a Christian;
	Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded
	The history of all her secret thoughts:
	So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
	That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
	I mean his conversation with Shore's wife,
	He liv'd from all attainder of suspect.
<SPEECH 140><ACT 3><SCENE 5><54%>
	What! think you we are Turks or infidels?
	Or that we would, against the form of law,
	Proceed thus rashly in the villain's death,
	But that the extreme peril of the case,
	The peace of England and our person's safety,
	Enforc'd us to this execution?
<SPEECH 141><ACT 3><SCENE 5><55%>
	And to that end we wish'd your lordship here,
	To avoid the censures of the carping world.
<SPEECH 142><ACT 3><SCENE 5><55%>
	Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
	The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
	There, at your meetest vantage of the time,
	Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
	Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,
	Only for saying he would make his son
	Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,
	Which by the sign thereof was termed so.
	Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
	And bestial appetite in change of lust;
	Which stretch'd unto their servants, daughters, wives,
	Even where his raging eye or savage heart
	Without control lusted to make a prey.
	Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
	Tell them, when that my mother went with child
	Of that insatiate Edward, noble York
	My princely father then had wars in France;
	And, by true computation of the time,
	Found that the issue was not his begot;
	Which well appeared in his lineaments,
	Being nothing like the noble duke my father.
	Yet touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off;
	Because, my lord, you know my mother lives.
<SPEECH 143><ACT 3><SCENE 5><55%>
	If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;
	Where you shall find me well accompanied
	With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.
<SPEECH 144><ACT 3><SCENE 5><56%>
	Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
	</STAGE DIR> Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both
	Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
	Now will I in, to take some privy order,
	To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;
	And to give notice that no manner person
	Have any time recourse unto the princes.
<SPEECH 145><ACT 3><SCENE 7><56%>
	How, now, how now! what say the citizens?
<SPEECH 146><ACT 3><SCENE 7><56%>
	Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?
<SPEECH 147><ACT 3><SCENE 7><57%>
	And did they so?
<SPEECH 148><ACT 3><SCENE 7><57%>
	What tongueless blocks were they! would they not speak?
	Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?
<SPEECH 149><ACT 3><SCENE 7><58%>
	I go; and if you plead as well for them
	As I can say nay to thee for myself,
	No doubt we bring it to a happy issue.
<SPEECH 150><ACT 3><SCENE 7><59%>
	My lord, there needs no such apology;
	I do beseech your Grace to pardon me,
	Who, earnest in the service of my God,
	Deferr'd the visitation of my friends.
	But, leaving this, what is your Grace's pleasure?
<SPEECH 151><ACT 3><SCENE 7><59%>
	I do suspect I have done some offence
	That seems disgracious in the city's eye;
	And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
<SPEECH 152><ACT 3><SCENE 7><59%>
	Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
<SPEECH 153><ACT 3><SCENE 7><60%>
	I cannot tell, if to depart in silence
	Or bitterly to speak in your reproof,
	Best fitteth my degree or your condition:
	If not to answer, you might haply think
	Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
	To bear the golden yoke of sov'reignty,
	Which fondly you would here impose on me;
	If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
	So season'd with your faithful love to me,
	Then, on the other side, I check'd my friends.
	Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
	And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
	Definitively thus I answer you.
	Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
	Unmeritable shuns your high request.
	First, if all obstacles were cut away,
	And that my path were even to the crown,
	As the ripe revenue and due of birth,
	Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
	So mighty and so many my defects,
	That I would rather hide me from my greatness,
	Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
	Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
	And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
	But, God be thank'd, there is no need of me;
	And much I need to help you, were there need;
	The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
	Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
	Will well become the seat of majesty,
	And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
	On him I lay that you would lay on me,
	The right and fortune of his happy stars;
	Which God defend that I should wring from him!
<SPEECH 154><ACT 3><SCENE 7><61%>
	Alas! why would you heap those cares on me?
	I am unfit for state and majesty:
	I do beseech you, take it not amiss,
	I cannot nor I will not yield to you.
<SPEECH 155><ACT 3><SCENE 7><62%>
	Will you enforce me to a world of cares?
	Call them again: I am not made of stone,
	But penetrable to your kind entreats,
	Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
	Cousin of Buckingham, and sage, grave men,
	Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
	To bear her burden, whe'r I will or no,
	I must have patience to endure the load:
	But if black scandal or foul-fac'd reproach
	Attend the sequel of your imposition,
	Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
	From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
	For God doth know, and you may partly see,
	How far I am from the desire of this.
<SPEECH 156><ACT 3><SCENE 7><62%>
	In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
<SPEECH 157><ACT 3><SCENE 7><62%>
	Even when you please, for you will have it so.
<SPEECH 158><ACT 3><SCENE 7><63%>
	</STAGE DIR> Come, let us to our holy work again.
	Farewell, my cousin;—farewell, gentle friends.
