<SPEECH 1><ACT 1><SCENE 3><21%>
	We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant,
	That we may be admitted where he is.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 3><21%>
	Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to prate;
	Talkers are no good doers: be assur'd
	We go to use our hands and not our tongues.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><21%>
	We will, my noble lord.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 4><23%>
	Ho! who's here?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 4><23%>
	I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	You may, sir; 'tis a point of wisdom: fare you well.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	No; he'll say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	Why, then he'll say we stabbed him sleeping.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	What! art thou afraid?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	I thought thou hadst been resolute.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	I'll back to the Duke of Gloucester, and tell him so.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	How dost thou feel thyself now?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	Remember our reward when the deed's done.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	Where's thy conscience now?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	So when he opens his purse to give us our reward, thy conscience flies out.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	What if it come to thee again?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	'Zounds! it is even now at my elbow, persuading me not to kill the duke.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	Tut, I am strong-framed; he cannot prevail with me.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy sword, and then throw him into the malmsey-butt in the next room.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	Soft! he wakes.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	No, we'll reason with him.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	A man, as you are.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	Nor you, as we are, loyal.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 4><26%>
	Offended us you have not, but the king.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 4><26%>
	What we will do, we do upon command.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 1><SCENE 4><26%>
	And, like a traitor to the name of God,
	Didst break that vow, and, with thy treacherous blade
	Unripp'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 1><SCENE 4><26%>
	How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
	When thou hast broke it in such dear degree?
<SPEECH 30><ACT 1><SCENE 4><27%>
	Who made thee then a bloody minister,
	When gallant-springing, brave Plantagenet,
	That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
<SPEECH 31><ACT 1><SCENE 4><27%>
	Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,
	Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 1><SCENE 4><27%>
	Ay, millstones; as he lesson'd us to weep.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 1><SCENE 4><27%>
	Right;
	As snow in harvest. Thou deceiv'st thyself:
	'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 1><SCENE 4><27%>
	Why, so he doth, when he delivers you
	From this earth's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 1><SCENE 4><28%>
	Relent! 'tis cowardly, and womanish.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 1><SCENE 4><28%>
	</STAGE DIR> Take that, and that: if all this will not do,
	I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 1><SCENE 4><28%>
	How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?
	By heaven, the duke shall know how slack you have been.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 1><SCENE 4><28%>
	So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
	Well, I'll go hide the body in some hole,
	Till that the duke give order for his burial:
	And when I have my meed, I will away;
	For this will out, and here I must not stay.
