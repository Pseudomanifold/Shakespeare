	Here, sir.

	A woman's tailor, sir.

	I will do my good will, sir: you can have no more.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
	I would Wart might have gone, sir.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
	It shall suffice, sir.

	By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once; we owe God a death. I'll ne'er bear a base mind: an't be my destiny, so; an't be not, so. No man's too good to serve's prince; and let it go which way it will, he that dies this year is quit for the next.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	Faith, I'll bear no base mind.
