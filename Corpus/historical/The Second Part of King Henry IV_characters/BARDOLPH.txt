	Where is the earl?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Tell thou the earl
	That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Here comes the earl.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Noble earl,
	I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	As good as heart can wish.
	The king is almost wounded to the death;
	And, in the fortune of my lord your son,
	Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts
	Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John
	And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field.
	And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,
	Is prisoner to your son: O! such a day,
	So fought, so follow'd, and so fairly won,
	Came not till now to dignify the times
	Since Cæsar's fortunes.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence;
	A gentleman well bred and of good name,
	That freely render'd me these news for true.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	My lord, I over-rode him on the way;
	And he is furnish'd with no certainties
	More than he haply may retail from me.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	My lord, I'll tell you what:
	If my young lord your son have not the day,
	Upon mine honour, for a silken point
	I'll give my barony: never talk of it.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Who, he?
	He was some hilding fellow that had stolen
	The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,
	Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	We all that are engaged to this loss
	Knew that we ventur'd on such dangerous seas
	That if we wrought out life 'twas ten to one;
	And yet we ventur'd, for the gain propos'd
	Chok'd the respect of likely peril fear'd;
	And since we are o'erset, venture again.
	Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	The question, then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus:
	Whether our present five-and-twenty thousand
	May hold up head without Northumberland.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	Ay, marry, there's the point:
	But if without him we be thought too feeble,
	My judgment is, we should not step too far
	Till we had his assistance by the hand;
	For in a theme so bloody-fao'd as this,
	Conjecture, expectation, and surmise
	Of aids incertain should not be admitted.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	It was, my lord; who lin'd himself with hope,
	Eating the air on promise of supply,
	Flattering himself with project of a power
	Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts;
	And so, with great imagination
	Proper to madmen, led his powers to death,
	And winking leap'd into destruction.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	Yes, if this present quality of war,—
	Indeed the instant action,—a cause on foot,
	Lives so in hope, as in an early spring
	We see the appearing buds; which, to prove fruit,
	Hope gives not so much warrant as despair
	That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,
	We first survey the plot, then draw the model;
	And when we see the figure of the house,
	Then must we rate the cost of the erection;
	Which if we find outweighs ability,
	What do we then but draw anew the model
	In fewer offices, or at last desist
	To build at all? Much more, in this great work,—
	Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
	And set another up,—should we survey
	The plot of situation and the model,
	Consent upon a sure foundation,
	Question surveyors, know our own estate,
	How able such a work to undergo,
	To weigh against his opposite; or else,
	We fortify in paper, and in figures,
	Using the names of men instead of men:
	Like one that draws the model of a house
	Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,
	Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost
	A naked-subject to the weeping clouds,
	And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.

	Sir, pardon; a soldier is better accommodated than with a wife.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	Pardon me, sir; I have heard the word. 'Phrase,' call you it? By this good day, I know not the phrase; but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a soldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good command, by heaven. Accommodated; that is, when a man is, as they say, accommodated; or, when a man is, being, whereby, a' may be thought to be accommodated, which is an excellent thing.
