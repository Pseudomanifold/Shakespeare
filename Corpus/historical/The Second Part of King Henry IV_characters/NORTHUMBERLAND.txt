	What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute now
	Should be the father of some stratagem.
	The times are wild; contention, like a horse
	Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose
	And bears down all before him.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Good, an God will!
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	How is this deriv'd?
	Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent
	On Tuesday last to listen after news.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Now, Travers, what good tidings come with you?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Ha! Again:
	Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?
	Of Hotspur, Coldspur? that rebellion
	Had met ill luck?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Why should the gentleman that rode by Travers
	Give then such instances of loss?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,
	Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:
	So looks the strond, whereon the imperious flood
	Hath left a witness'd usurpation.
	Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	How doth my son and brother?
	Thou tremblest, and the whiteness in thy cheek
	Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.
	Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,
	So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,
	Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,
	And would have told him half his Troy was burn'd;
	But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,
	And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.
	This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;
	Your brother thus; so fought the noble Douglas;'
	Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:
	But in the end, to stop mine ear indeed,
	Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,
	Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Why, he is dead.â€”
	See, what a ready tongue suspicion hath!
	He that but fears the thing he would not know
	Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes
	That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton:
	Tell thou thy earl his divination lies,
	And I will take it as a sweet disgrace
	And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.
	I see a strange confession in thine eye:
	Thou shak'st thy head, and hold'st it fear or sin
	To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;
	The tongue offends not that reports his death:
	And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,
	Not he which says the dead is not alive.
	Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
	Hath but a losing office, and his tongue
	Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,
	Remember'd knolling a departing friend.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	For this I shall have time enough to mourn.
	In poison there is physic; and these news,
	Having been well, that would have made me sick,
	Being sick, have in some measure made me well:
	And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints,
	Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,
	Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire
	Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,
	Weaken'd with grief, being now enrag'd with grief,
	Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!
	A scaly gauntlet now, with joints of steel
	Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!
	Thou art a guard too wanton for the head
	Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.
	Now bind my brows with iron; and approach
	The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring
	To frown upon the enrag'd Northumberland!
	Let heaven kiss earth! now let not nature's hand
	Keep the wild flood confin'd! let order die!
	And let this world no longer be a stage
	To feed contention in a lingering act;
	But let one spirit of the first-born Cain
	Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set
	On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,
	And darkness be the burier of the dead!
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,
	This present grief had wip'd it from my mind.
	Go in with me; and counsel every man
	The aptest way for safety and revenge:
	Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed:
	Never so few, and never yet more need.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
	I pray thee, loving wife, and gentle daughter,
	Give even way unto my rough affairs:
	Put not you on the visage of the times,
	And be like them to Percy troublesome.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
	Alas! sweet wife, my honour is at pawn;
	And, but my going, nothing can redeem it.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
	Beshrew your heart,
	Fair daughter! you do draw my spirits from me
	With new lamenting ancient oversights.
	But I must go and meet with danger there,
	Or it will seek me in another place,
	And find me worse provided.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
	Come, come, go in with me. 'Tis with my mind
	As with the tide swell'd up unto its height,
	That makes a still-stand, running neither way:
	Fain would I go to meet the archbishop,
	But many thousand reasons hold me back.
	I will resolve for Scotland: there am I,
	Till time and vantage crave my company.
