	From enemies heaven keep your majesty;
	And, when they stand against you, may they fall
	As those that I am come to tell you of!
	The Earl Northumberland, and the Lord Bardolph,
	With a great power of English and of Scots,
	Are by the sheriff of Yorkshire overthrown.
	The manner and true order of the fight
	This packet, please it you, contains at large.
