	My lord,—
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 3><11%>
	Yea, my good lord.
	Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,
	Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,
	Were, as he says, not with such strength denied
	As is deliver'd to your majesty:
	Either envy, therefore, or misprision
	Is guilty of this fault and not my son.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	What! drunk with choler? stay, and pause awhile:
	Here comes your uncle.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	He was; I heard the proclamation:
	And then it was when the unhappy king,—
	Whose wrongs in us God pardon!—did set forth
	Upon his Irish expedition;
	From whence he, intercepted, did return
	To be depos'd, and shortly murdered.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	He did; myself did hear it.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	Imagination of some great exploit
	Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
	Art thou to break into this woman's mood,
	Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	At Berkeley Castle.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
	Before the game's afoot thou still lett'st slip.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 3><20%>
	Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust.
