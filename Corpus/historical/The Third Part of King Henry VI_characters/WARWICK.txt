	I wonder how the king escap'd our hands.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
	Before I see thee seated in that throne
	Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,
	I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
	This is the palace of the fearful king,
	And this the regal seat: possess it, York;
	For this is thine, and not King Henry's heirs'.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	And when the king comes, offer him no violence,
	Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,
	Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,
	And bashful Henry depos'd, whose cowardice
	Hath made us by-words to our enemies.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,
	The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,
	Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells.
	I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares.
	Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
	In following this usurping Henry.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	True, Clifford; and that's Richard, Duke of York.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Be Duke of Lancaster: let him be king.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
	That we are those which chas'd you from the field
	And slew your fathers, and with colours spread
	March'd through the city to the palace gates.

	Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats.

	Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,

<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Do right unto this princely Duke of York,

	What good is this to England and himself!
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	Why should you sigh, my lord?
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	Long live King Henry! Plantagenet, embrace him.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	And I'll keep London with my soldiers.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears,
	And now, to add more measure to your woes,
	I come to tell you things sith then befallen.
	After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
	Where your brave father breath'd his latest gasp,
	Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,
	Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
	I, then in London, keeper of the king,
	Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,
	And very well appointed, as I thought,
	March'd towards Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,
	Bearing the king in my behalf along;
	For by my scouts I was advertised
	That she was coming with a full intent
	To dash our late decree in parliament,
	Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.
	Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met,
	Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:
	But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,
	Who look'd full gently on his war-like queen,
	That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;
	Or whether 'twas report of her success;
	Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,
	Who thunders to his captives blood and death,
	I cannot judge: but, to conclude with truth,
	Their weapons like to lightning came and went;
	Our soldiers'—like the night-owl's lazy flight,
	Or like a lazy thresher with a flail—
	Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.
	I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,
	With promise of high pay, and great rewards:
	But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,
	And we in them no hope to win the day;
	So that we fled: the king unto the queen;
	Lord George your brother, Norfolk, and myself,
	In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you;
	For in the marches here we heard you were,
	Making another head to fight again.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;
	And for your brother, he was lately sent
	From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
	With aid of soldiers to this needful war.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
	For thou shalt know, this strong right hand of mine
	Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,
	And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
	Were he as famous, and as bold in war
	As he is fam'd for mildness, peace, and prayer.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
	And therefore comes my brother Montague.
	Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,
	With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,
	And of their feather many more proud birds,
	Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
	He swore consent to your succession,
	His oath enrolled in the parliament;
	And now to London all the crew are gone,
	To frustrate both his oath and what beside
	May make against the house of Lancaster.
	Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:
	Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,
	With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,
	Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,
	Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,
	Why, Via! to London will we march amain,
	And once again bestride our foaming steeds,
	And once again cry, 'Charge upon our foes!'
	But never once again turn back and fly.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:
	The next degree is England's royal throne;
	For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd
	In every borough as we pass along;
	And he that throws not up his cap for joy
	Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
	King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,
	Stay we no longer dreaming of renown,
	But sound the trumpets, and about our task.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	How now! what news?
<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	Why then it sorts; brave warriors, let's away.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	What sayst thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?
<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
	For York in justice puts his armour on.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
	Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
	I lay me down a little while to breathe;
	For strokes receiv'd, and many blows repaid,
	Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
	And spite of spite needs must I rest a while.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
	How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good?
<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
	Then let the earth be drunken with our blood:
	I'll kill my horse because I will not fly.
	Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,
	Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage;
	And look upon, as if the tragedy
	Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?
	Here on my knee I vow to God above,
	I'll never pause again, never stand still
	Till either death hath clos'd these eyes of mine,
	Of fortune given me measure of revenge.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
	Away, away! Once more, sweet lords, farewell.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 6><41%>
	No, 'tis impossible he should escape;
	For, though before his face I speak the words,
	Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave;
	And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 6><41%>
	From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
	Your father's head, which Clifford placed there;
	Instead whereof let this supply the room:
	Measure for measure must be answered.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 2><SCENE 6><42%>
	I think his understanding is bereft.
	Speak, Clifford; dost thou know who speaks to thee?
	Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,
	And he nor sees, nor hears us what we say.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 6><42%>
	Clifford! devise excuses for thy faults.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 6><42%>
	They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 2><SCENE 6><43%>
	Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,
	And rear it in the place your father's stands.
	And now to London with triumphant march,
	There to be crowned England's royal king:
	From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,
	And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen.
	So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;
	And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread
	The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;
	For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,
	Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.
	First will I see the coronation;
	And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,
	To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 2><SCENE 6><43%>
	Tut! that's a foolish observation:
	Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London,
	To see these honours in possession.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
	From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
	My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,
	I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,

	And lastly to confirm that amity
	With nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant
	That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,
	To England's king in lawful marriage.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
	</STAGE DIR> And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,
	I am commanded, with your leave and favour,
	Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue
	To tell the passion of my sov'reign's heart;
	Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,
	Hath plac'd thy beauty's image and thy virtue.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
	Injurious Margaret!
<SPEECH 48><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
	Because thy father Henry did usurp,
	And thou no more art prince than she is queen.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
	Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,
	You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
	All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten?
	Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.
	But for the rest, you tell a pedigree
	Of threescore and two years; a silly time
	To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
	Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,
	Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?
	For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
	And I the house of York.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
	Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
	The more that Henry was unfortunate.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
	Such it seems
	As may beseem a monarch like himself.
	Myself have often heard him say and swear
	That this his love was an eternal plant,
	Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,
	The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,
	Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
	Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
	Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.
	And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,
	You have a father able to maintain you,
	And better 'twere you troubled him than France.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 3><SCENE 3><60%>
	Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 3><SCENE 3><60%>
	King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,
	And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,
	That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's;
	No more my king, for he dishonours me;
	But most himself, if he could see his shame.
	Did I forget that by the house of York
	My father came untimely to his death?
	Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?
	Did I impale him with the regal crown?
	Did I put Henry from his native right?
	And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?
	Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:
	And, to repair my honour, lost for him,
	I here renounce him and return to Henry.
	My noble queen, let former grudges pass,
	And henceforth I am thy true servitor.
	I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,
	And replant Henry in his former state.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 3><SCENE 3><60%>
	So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
	That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
	With some few bands of chosen soldiers,
	I'll undertake to land them on our coast,
	And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
	'Tis not his new-made bride shall succour him:
	And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,
	He's very likely now to fall from him,
	For matching more for wanton lust than honour,
	Or than for strength and safety of our country.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 3><SCENE 3><61%>
	And mine, fair Lady Bona, joins with yours.
<SPEECH 60><ACT 3><SCENE 3><61%>
	Tell him from me, that he hath done me wrong,
	And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
	There's thy reward: be gone.
<SPEECH 61><ACT 3><SCENE 3><62%>
	This shall assure my constant loyalty:
	That if our queen and this young prince agree,
	I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
	To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 3><SCENE 3><62%>
	I came from Edward as ambassador,
	But I return his sworn and mortal foe:
	Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,
	But dreadful war shall answer his demand.
	Had he none else to make a stale but me?
	Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.
	I was the chief that rais'd him to the crown,
	And I'll be chief to bring him down again:
	Not that I pity Henry's misery,
	But seek revenge on Edward's mockery.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;
	The common people by numbers swarm to us.
	But see where Somerset and Clarence come!
	Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?
<SPEECH 64><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;
	And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice,
	To rest mistrustful where a noble heart
	Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;
	Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother,
	Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings:
	But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine.
	And now what rests, but in night's coverture,
	Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,
	His soldiers lurking in the towns about,
	And but attended by a simple guard,
	We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?
	Our scouts have found the adventure very easy.
	That as Ulysses, and stout Diomede,
	With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,
	And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds;
	So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,
	At unawares may beat down Edward's guard,
	And seize himself; I say not, slaughter him,
	For I intend but only to surprise him.
	You, that will follow me to this attempt,
	Applaud the name of Henry with your leader.
	Why, then, let's on our way in silent sort.
	For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George!
<SPEECH 65><ACT 4><SCENE 3><69%>
	This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.
	Courage, my masters! honour now or never!
	But follow me, and Edward shall be ours.
<SPEECH 66><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	Richard and Hastings: let them go; here's the duke.
<SPEECH 67><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	Ay, but the case is alter'd:
	When you disgrac'd me in my embassade,
	Then I degraded you from being king,
	And come now to create you Duke of York.
	Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,
	That know not how to use ambassadors,
	Nor how to be contented with one wife,
	Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,
	Nor how to study for the people's welfare,
	Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?
<SPEECH 68><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king:
	But Henry now shall wear the English crown,
	And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.
	My Lord of Somerset, at my request,
	See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd
	Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.
	When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,
	I'll follow you, and tell what answer
	Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him:
	Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York.
<SPEECH 69><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
	Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;
	To free King Henry from imprisonment,
	And see him seated in the regal throne.
<SPEECH 70><ACT 4><SCENE 6><74%>
	Your Grace hath still been fam'd for virtuous;
	And now may seem as wise as virtuous,
	By spying and avoiding Fortune's malice;
	For few men rightly temper with the stars:
	Yet in this one thing let me blame your Grace,
	For choosing me when Clarence is in place.
<SPEECH 71><ACT 4><SCENE 6><75%>
	And I choose Clarence only for protector.
<SPEECH 72><ACT 4><SCENE 6><75%>
	What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?
<SPEECH 73><ACT 4><SCENE 6><75%>
	Why then, though loath, yet must I be content:
	We'll yoke together, like a double shadow
	To Henry's body, and supply his place;
	I mean, in bearing weight of government,
	While he enjoys the honour and his ease.
	And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful
	Forthwith that Edward be pronounc'd a traitor,
	And all his lands and goods be confiscate.
<SPEECH 74><ACT 4><SCENE 6><75%>
	Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.
<SPEECH 75><ACT 4><SCENE 6><76%>
	What news, my friend?
<SPEECH 76><ACT 4><SCENE 6><76%>
	Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?
<SPEECH 77><ACT 4><SCENE 6><76%>
	My brother was too careless of his charge.
	But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide
	A salve for any sore that may betide.
<SPEECH 78><ACT 4><SCENE 8><80%>
	What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,
	With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,
	Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,
	And with his troops doth march amain to London;
	And many giddy people flock to him.
<SPEECH 79><ACT 4><SCENE 8><80%>
	In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,
	Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war;
	Those will I muster up: and thou, son Clarence,
	Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent,
	The knights and gentlemen to come with thee:
	Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham,
	Northampton, and in Leicestershire, shalt find
	Men well inclin'd to hear what thou command'st:
	And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well belov'd
	In Oxfordshire, shalt muster up thy friends.
	My sov'reign, with the loving citizens,
	Like to his island girt in with the ocean,
	Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs,
	Shall rest in London till we come to him.
	Fair lords, take leave, and stand not to reply.
	Farewell, my sovereign.
<SPEECH 80><ACT 4><SCENE 8><81%>

	Where is the post that came from Montague?
<SPEECH 83><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?

	Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.
<SPEECH 85><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>

	O, unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?
	Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduc'd,
	That we could hear no news of his repair?
<SPEECH 87><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,—
	Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee down?—
	Call Warwick patron, and be penitent;
	And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.
<SPEECH 88><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?
<SPEECH 89><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
<SPEECH 90><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:
	And, weakling, Warwick takes his gift again;
	And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject.
<SPEECH 91><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
	And with the other fling it at thy face,

	O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
<SPEECH 93><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	O! welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.
<SPEECH 94><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	And lo! where George of Clarence sweeps along,
	Of force enough to bid his brother battle;
	With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
	More than the nature of a brother's love.
	Come, Clarence, come; thou wilt, if Warwick call.
<SPEECH 95><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	O passing traitor, perjur'd, and unjust!
<SPEECH 96><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	Alas! I am not coop'd here for defence:
	I will away towards Barnet presently,
	And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou dar'st.
<SPEECH 97><ACT 5><SCENE 2><87%>
	Ah! who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,
	And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
	Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,
	My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows,
	That I must yield my body to the earth,
	And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
	Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
	Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
	Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
	Whose top branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree,
	And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.
	These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
	Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,
	To search the secret treasons of the world:
	The wrinkles in my brows, now fill'd with blood,
	Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres;
	For who liv'd king, but I could dig his grave?
	And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow?
	Lo! now my glory smear'd in dust and blood;
	My parks, my walks, my manors that I had,
	Even now forsake me; and, of all my lands
	Is nothing left me but my body's length.
	Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?
	And, live we how we can, yet die we must.

	Why, then, I would not fly. Ah! Montague,
	If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand,
	And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile.
	Thou lov'st me not; for, brother, if thou didst,
	Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
	That glues my lips and will not let me speak.
	Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.
<SPEECH 99><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
	Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;
	For Warwick bids you all farewell, to meet in heaven.
