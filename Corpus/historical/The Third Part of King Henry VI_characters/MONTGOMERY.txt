	And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
	Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	</STAGE DIR> Good brother, as thou lov'st and honour'st arms,
	Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	And I unto the sea from whence I came.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	But I have reasons strong and forcible.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not:
	And thus most humbly I do take my leave.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
	Yet to have join'd with France in such alliance
	Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth
	'Gainst foreign storms, than any home-bred marriage.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
	Yes; but the safer when 'tis back'd with France.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
	So God help Montague as he proves true!
<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 7><78%>
	To help King Edward in his time of storm,
	As every loyal subject ought to do.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 7><79%>
	Then fare you well, for I will hence again:
	I came to serve a king and not a duke.
	Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 7><79%>
	What talk you of debating? in few words,
	If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king.
	I'll leave you to your fortune, and be gone
	To keep them back that come to succour you.
	Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 7><79%>
	Ay, now my sov'reign speaketh like himself;
	And now will I be Edward's champion.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 7><79%>
	And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,
	By this I challenge him to single fight.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 8><81%>
	Comfort, my lord; and so, I take my leave.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!
