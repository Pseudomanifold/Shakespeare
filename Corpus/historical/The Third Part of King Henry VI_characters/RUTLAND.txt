	Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?
	Ah! tutor, look, where bloody Clifford comes!

	So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
	That trembles under his devouring paws;
	And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,
	And so he comes to rend his limbs asunder.
	Ah! gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword,
	And not with such a cruel threatening look.
	Sweet Clifford! hear me speak before I die:
	I am too mean a subject for thy wrath;
	Be thou reveng'd on men, and let me live.

	Then let my father's blood open it again:
	He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him.

	O! let me pray before I take my death.
	To thee I pray; sweet Clifford, pity me!

	I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	But 'twas ere I was born.
	Thou hast one son; for his sake pity me,
	Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,
	He be as miserably slain as I.
	Ah! let me live in prison all my days;
	And when I give occasion of offence,
	Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.
