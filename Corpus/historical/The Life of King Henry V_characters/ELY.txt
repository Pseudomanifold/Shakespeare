	The strawberry grows underneath the nettle,
	And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
	Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:
	And so the prince obscur'd his contemplation
	Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
	Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,
	Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.

	How now for mitigation of this bill
	Urg'd by the commons? Doth his majesty
	Incline to it, or no?

	Awake remembrance of these valiant dead,
	And with your puissant arm renew their feats:
	You are their heir, you sit upon their throne,
	The blood and courage that renowned them
	Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissantliege
	Is in the very May-morn of his youth,
	Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.
