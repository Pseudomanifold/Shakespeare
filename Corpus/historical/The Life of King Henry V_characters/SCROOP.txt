	So service shall with steeled sinews toil,

	To do your Grace incessant services.

	That's mercy, but too much security:
	Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest example
	Breed, by his sufference, more of such a kind.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 2><20%>

	Our purposes God justly hath discover'd,
	And I repent my fault more than my death;
	Which I beseech your highness to forgive,
	Although my body pay the price of it.
