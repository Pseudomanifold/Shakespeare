<SPEECH 1><ACT 3><SCENE 3><39%>
	Our expectation hath this day an end.
	The Dauphin, whom of succour we entreated,
	Returns us that his powers are yet not ready
	To raise so great a siege. Therefore, great king,
	We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.
	Enter our gates; dispose of us and ours;
	For we no longer are defensible.
