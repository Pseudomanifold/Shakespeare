	That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness
	Under the sweet shade of your government.

	I one, my lord:
	Your highness bade me ask for it to-day.

	For me, the gold of France did not seduce,
	Although I did admit it as a motive
	The sooner to effect what I intended:
	But God be thanked for prevention;
	Which I in sufference heartily will rejoice,
	Beseeching God and you to pardon me.
