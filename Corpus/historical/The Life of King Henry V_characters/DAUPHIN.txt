	My most redoubted father,
	It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;
	For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,—
	Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,—
	But that defences, musters, preparations,
	Should be maintain'd, assembled, and collected,
	As were a war in expectation.
	Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forth
	To view the sick and feeble parts of France:
	And let us do it with no show of fear;
	No, with no more than if we heard that England
	Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:
	For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,
	Her sceptre so fantastically borne
	By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,
	That fear attends her not.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 4><27%>
	Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable;
	But though we think it so, it is no matter:
	In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh
	The enemy more mighty than he seems:
	So the proportions of defence are fill'd;
	Which of a weak and niggardly projection
	Doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting
	A little cloth.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 4><28%>
	Turn head, and stop pursuit; for coward dogs
	Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
	Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,
	Take up the English short, and let them know
	Of what a monarchy you are the head:
	Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin
	As self-neglecting.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
	For the Dauphin,
	I stand here for him: what to him from England?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
	Say, if my father render fair return,
	It is against my will; for I desire
	Nothing but odds with England: to that end,
	As matching to his youth and vanity,
	I did present him with the Paris balls.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 5><41%>
	O Dieu vivant! shall a few sprays of us,
	The emptying of our fathers' luxury,
	Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,
	Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds,
	And overlook their grafters?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 5><42%>
	By faith and honour,
	Our madams mock at us, and plainly say
	Our mettle is bred out; and they will give
	Their bodies to the lust of English youth
	To new-store France with bastard warriors.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 5><43%>
	Not so, I do beseech your majesty.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 7><48%>
	My Lord of Orleans, and my lord high constable, you talk of horse and armour—
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 7><49%>
	What a long night is this! I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns. Ça, ha! He bounds from the earth as if his entrails were hairs: le cheval volant, the Pegasus, qui a les narines de feu! When I bestride him, I soar, I am a hawk: he trots the air; the earth sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 7><49%>
	And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for Perseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him: he is indeed a horse; and all other jades you may call beasts.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 7><49%>
	It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 7><49%>
	Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary deserved praise on my palfrey: it is a theme as fluent as the sea; turn the sands into eloquent tongues, and my horse is argument for them all. 'Tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for a sovereign's sovereign to ride on; and for the world—familiar to us, and unknown—to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him. I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus: 'Wonder of nature!'—
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 7><49%>
	Then did they imitate that which I composed to my courser; for my horse is my mistress.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
	Me well; which is the prescript praise and perfection of a good and particular mistress.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
	So perhaps did yours.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
	O! then belike she was old and gentle; and you rode, like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off and in your straight strossers.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
	Be warned by me, then: they that ride so, and ride not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have my horse to my mistress.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
	I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his own hair.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
	Le chien est retourné à son propre vomissement, et la truie lavée au bourbier: thou makest use of any thing.

	Some of them will fall to-morrow, I hope.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
	That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and 'twere more honour some were away.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
	Would I were able to load him with his desert! Will it never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile, and my way shall be paved with English faces.

	'Tis midnight: I'll go arm myself.

	Ciel! cousin Orleans.
	Now, my lord constable!
<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
	Mount them, and make incision in their hides,
	That their hot blood may spin in English eyes,
	And dout them with superfluous courage: ha!
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits,
	And give their fasting horses provender,
	And after fight with them?
<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 5><72%>
	Mort de ma vie! all is confounded, all!
	Reproach and everlasting shame
	Sit mocking in our plumes. O meschante fortune!
	Do not run away.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 5><72%>
	O perdurable shame! let's stab ourselves.
	Be these the wretches that we play'd at dice for?
