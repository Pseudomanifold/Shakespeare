	No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot lodge and board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live honestly by the prick of their needles, but it will be thought we keep a bawdy-house straight. [<NYM AND PISTOL DRAW.] O WELL-A-DAY LADY! IF HE BE...>

	Good Corporal Nym, show thy valour and put up your sword.

	By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding one of these days. The king has killed his heart. Good husband, come home presently.

	As ever you came of women, come in quickly to Sir John. Ah, poor heart! he is so shaked of a burning quotidian tertian, that it is most lamentable to behold. Sweet men, come to him.

	Prithee, honey-sweet husband, let me bring thee to Staines.

	Nay, sure, he's not in hell: he's in Arthur's bosom, if ever man went to Arthur's bosom. A' made a finer end and went away an it had been any christom child; a' parted even just between twelve and one, even at the turning o' the tide: for after I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with flowers and smile upon his fingers' ends, I knew there was but one way; for his nose was as sharp as a pen, and a' babbled of green fields. 'How now, Sir John!' quoth I: 'what man! be of good cheer.' So a' cried out 'God, God, God!' three or four times: now I, to comfort him, bid him a' should not think of God, I hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So a' bade me lay more clothes on his feet: I put my hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as cold as any stone; then I felt to his knees, and so upward, and upward, and all was as cold as any stone.

	A' could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour he never liked.

	A' did in some sort, indeed, handle women; but then he was rheumatic, and talked of the whore of Babylon.

	Farewell; adieu.
