	O peace, Prince Dauphin!
	You are too much mistaken in this king.
	Question your Grace the late ambassadors,
	With what great state he heard their embassy,
	How well supplied with noble counsellors,
	How modest in exception, and, withal
	How terrible in constant resolution,
	And you shall find his vanities forespent
	Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,
	Covering discretion with a coat of folly;
	As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
	That shall first spring and be most delicate.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 5><41%>
	And if he be not fought withal, my lord,
	Let us not live in France; let us quit all,
	And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 5><41%>
	Dieu de battailes! where have they this mettle?
	Is not their climate foggy, raw, and dull,
	On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,
	Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water,
	A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,
	Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
	And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,
	Seem frosty? O! for honour of our land,
	Let us not hang like roping icicles
	Upon our houses' thatch, whiles a more frosty people
	Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields;
	Poor we may call them in their native lords.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 5><42%>
	This becomes the great.
	Sorry am I his numbers are so few,
	His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march,
	For I am sure when he shall see our army
	He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear,
	And for achievement offer us his ransom.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 7><48%>
	Tut! I have the best armour of the world. Would it were day!
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 7><48%>
	It is the best horse of Europe.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 7><49%>
	Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
	Ma foi, methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your back.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
	Mine was not bridled.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
	You have good judgment in horsemanship.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
	I had as lief have my mistress a jade.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
	I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to my mistress.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
	Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress: or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
	Stars, my lord.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
	And yet my sky shall not want.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
	Even as your horse bears your praises; who would trot as well were some of your brags dismounted.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 7><51%>
	I will not say so for fear I should be faced out of my way. But I would it were morning, for I would fain be about the ears of the English.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 7><51%>
	You must first go yourself to hazard, ere you have them.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 7><51%>
	I think he will eat all he kills.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 7><51%>
	Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 7><51%>
	Doing is activity, and he will still be doing.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 7><51%>
	Nor will do none to-morrow: he will keep that good name still.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 7><51%>
	I was told that by one that knows him better than you.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 7><51%>
	Marry, he told me so himself; and he said he cared not who knew it.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 7><51%>
	By my faith, sir, but it is; never any body saw it but his lackey: 'tis a hooded valour; and when it appears, it will bate.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 7><51%>
	I will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in friendship.'
<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 7><51%>
	Well placed: there stands your friend for the devil: have at the very eye of that proverb, with 'A pox of the devil.'
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 7><52%>
	You have shot over.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 7><52%>
	Who hath measured the ground?
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 7><52%>
	A valiant and most expert gentleman. Would it were day! Alas! poor Harry of England, he longs not for the dawning as we do.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 7><52%>
	If the English had any apprehension they would run away.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 7><52%>
	Just, just; and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on, leaving their wits with their wives: and then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel, they will eat like wolves and fight like devils.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 7><52%>
	Then shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight. Now is it time to arm; come, shall we about it?
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
	Hark how our steeds for present service neigh!
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
	To horse, you gallant princes! straight to horse!
	Do but behold yon poor and starved band,
	And your fair show shall suck away their souls,
	Leaving them but the shales and husks of men.
	There is not work enough for all our hands;
	Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
	To give each naked curtal-axe a stain,
	That our French gallants shall to-day draw out,
	And sheathe for lack of sport: let us but blow on them,
	The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them.
	'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords,
	That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants,
	Who in unnecessary action swarm
	About our squares of battle, were enow
	To purge this field of such a hilding foe,
	Though we upon this mountain's basis by
	Took stand for idle speculation:
	But that our honours must not. What's to say?
	A very little little let us do,
	And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound
	The tucket sonance and the note to mount:
	For our approach shall so much dare the field,
	That England shall couch down in fear and yield.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	They have said their prayers, and they stay for death.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	I stay but for my guard: on, to the field!
	I will the banner from a trumpet take,
	And use it for my haste. Come, come, away!
	The sun is high, and we outwear the day.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 5><72%>
	Why, all our ranks are broke.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
	Disorder, that hath spoil'd us, friend us now!
	Let us on heaps go offer up our lives.
