	It follows then the cat must stay at home:
	Yet that is but a crush'd necessity;
	Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries

	While that the armed hand doth fight abroad
	The advised head defends itself at home:
	For government, though high and low and lower,

	From him; and thus he greets your majesty.
	He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,
	That you divest yourself, and lay apart
	The borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven,
	By law of nature and of nations 'long
	To him and to his heirs; namely, the crown
	And all wide-stretched honours that pertain
	By custom and the ordinance of times
	Unto the crown of France. That you may know
	'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,
	Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,
	Nor from the dust of old oblivion rak'd,
	He sends you this most memorable line,
	In every branch truly demonstrative;
	Willing you overlook this pedigree;
	And when you find him evenly deriv'd
	From his most fam'd of famous ancestors,
	Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
	Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held
	From him the native and true challenger.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 4><29%>
	Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown
	Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:
	Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,
	In thunder and in earthquake like a Jove,
	That, if requiring fail, he will compel;
	And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,
	Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy
	On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
	Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head
	Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries,
	The dead men's blood, the pining maidens' groans,
	For husbands, fathers, and betrothed lovers,
	That shall be swallow'd in this controversy.
	This is his claim, his threat'ning, and my message;
	Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,
	To whom expressly I bring greeting too.

	Scorn and defiance, slight regard, contempt,
	And anything that may not misbecome
	The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
	Thus says my king: an if your father's highness
	Do not, in grant of all demands at large,
	Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,
	He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,
	That caves and womby vaultages of France
	Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
	In second accent of his ordinance.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
	He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,
	Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:
	And, be assur'd, you'll find a difference—
	As we his subjects have in wonder found—
	Between the promise of his greener days
	And these he masters now. Now he weighs time
	Even to the utmost grain; that you shall read
	In your own losses, if he stay in France.

	The Duke of York commends him to your majesty.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 6><73%>
	In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie,
	Larding the plain; and by his bloody side,—
	Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds,—
	The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.
	Suffolk first died: and York, all haggled over,
	Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteep'd,
	And takes him by the beard, kisses the gashes
	That bloodily did yawn upon his face;
	And cries aloud, 'Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk!
	My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;
	Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,
	As in this glorious and well-foughten field,
	We kept together in our chivalry!'
	Upon these words I came and cheer'd him up:
	He smil'd me in the face, raught me his hand,
	And with a feeble gripe says, 'Dear my lord,
	Commend my service to my sovereign.'
	So did he turn, and over Suffolk's neck
	He threw his wounded arm, and kiss'd his lips;
	And so espous'd to death, with blood he seal'd
	A testament of noble-ending love.
	The pretty and sweet manner of it forc'd
	Those waters from me which I would have stopp'd;
	But I had not so much of man in me,
	And all my mother came into mine eyes
	And gave me up to tears.
