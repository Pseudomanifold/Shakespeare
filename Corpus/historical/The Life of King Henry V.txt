	O! for a Muse of fire, that would ascend
	The brightest heaven of invention;
	A kingdom for a stage, princes to act
	And monarchs to behold the swelling scene.
	Then should the war-like Harry, like himself,
	Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,
	Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword, and fire
	Crouch for employment. But pardon, gentles all,
	The flat unraised spirits that hath dar'd
	On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
	So great an object: can this cockpit hold
	The vasty fields of France? or may we cram
	Within this wooden O the very casques
	That did affright the air at Agincourt?
	O, pardon! since a crooked figure may
	Attest in little place a million;
	And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,
	On your imaginary forces work.
	Suppose within the girdle of these walls
	Are now confin'd two mighty monarchies,
	Whose high upreared and abutting fronts
	The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:
	Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts:
	Into a thousand parts divide one man,
	And make imaginary puissance;
	Think when we talk of horses that you see them
	Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;
	For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,
	Carry them here and there, jumping o'er times,
	Turning the accomplishment of many years
	Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,
	Admit me Chorus to this history;
	Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,
	Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.

<SCENE 1>
<London. An Antechamber in the King's Palace.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Ely.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CANTERBURY>	<1%>
	My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urg'd,
	Which in th' eleventh year of the last king's reign
	Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,
	But that the scambling and unquiet time
	Did push it out of further question.
</CANTERBURY>

<ELY>	<1%>
	But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?
</ELY>

<CANTERBURY>	<2%>
	It must be thought on. If it pass against us,
	We lose the better half of our possession;
	For all the temporal lands which men devout
	By testament have given to the church
	Would they strip from us; being valu'd thus:
	As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,
	Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,
	Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;
	And, to relief of lazars and weak age,
	Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil,
	A hundred almshouses right well supplied;
	And to the coffers of the king beside,
	A thousand pounds by the year. Thus runs the bill.
</CANTERBURY>

<ELY>	<2%>
	This would drink deep.
</ELY>

<CANTERBURY>	<2%>
	'Twould drink the cup and all.
</CANTERBURY>

<ELY>	<2%>
	But what prevention?
</ELY>

<CANTERBURY>	<2%>
	The king is full of grace and fair regard.
</CANTERBURY>

<ELY>	<2%>
	And a true lover of the holy church.
</ELY>

<CANTERBURY>	<2%>
	The courses of his youth promis'd it not.
	The breath no sooner left his father's body
	But that his wildness, mortified in him,
	Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment,
	Consideration like an angel came,
	And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,
	Leaving his body as a paradise,
	To envelop and contain celestial spirits.
	Never was such a sudden scholar made;
	Never came reformation in a flood,
	With such a heady currance, scouring faults;
	Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness
	So soon did lose his seat and all at once
	As in this king.
</CANTERBURY>

<ELY>	<2%>
	We are blessed in the change.
</ELY>

<CANTERBURY>	<2%>
	Hear him but reason in divinity,
	And, all-admiring, with an inward wish
	You would desire the king were made a prelate:
	Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
	You would say it hath been all in all his study:
	List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
	A fearful battle render'd you in music:
	Turn him to any cause of policy,
	The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,
	Familiar as his garter; that, when he speaks,
	The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,
	And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,
	To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;
	So that the art and practic part of life
	Must be the mistress to this theoric:
	Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it,
	Since his addiction was to courses vain;
	His companies unletter'd, rude, and shallow;
	His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports;
	And never noted in him any study,
	Any retirement, any sequestration
	From open haunts and popularity.
</CANTERBURY>

<ELY>	<3%>
	The strawberry grows underneath the nettle,
	And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
	Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:
	And so the prince obscur'd his contemplation
	Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
	Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,
	Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.
</ELY>

<CANTERBURY>	<3%>
	It must be so; for miracles are ceas'd;
	And therefore we must needs admit the means
	How things are perfected.
</CANTERBURY>

<ELY>	<3%>
	But, my good lord,
	How now for mitigation of this bill
	Urg'd by the commons? Doth his majesty
	Incline to it, or no?
</ELY>

<CANTERBURY>	<3%>
	He seems indifferent,
	Or rather swaying more upon our part
	Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;
	For I have made an offer to his majesty,
	Upon our spiritual convocation,
	And in regard of causes now in hand,
	Which I have open'd to his Grace at large,
	As touching France, to give a greater sum
	Than ever at one time the clergy yet
	Did to his predecessors part withal.
</CANTERBURY>

<ELY>	<4%>
	How did this offer seem receiv'd, my lord?
</ELY>

<CANTERBURY>	<4%>
	With good acceptance of his majesty;
	Save that there was not time enough to hear,—
	As I perceiv'd his Grace would fain have done,—
	The severals and unhidden passages
	Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms,
	And generally to the crown and seat of France,
	Deriv'd from Edward, his great-grandfather.
</CANTERBURY>

<ELY>	<4%>
	What was the impediment that broke this off?
</ELY>

<CANTERBURY>	<4%>
	The French ambassador upon that instant
	Crav'd audience; and the hour I think is come
	To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?
</CANTERBURY>

<ELY>	<4%>
	It is.
</ELY>

<CANTERBURY>	<4%>
	Then go we in to know his embassy;
	Which I could with a ready guess declare
	Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.
</CANTERBURY>

	I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Ely.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CANTERBURY>	<4%>
	God and his angels guard your sacred throne,
	And make you long become it!
</CANTERBURY>

<K. HENRY>	<5%>
	Sure, we thank you.
	My learned lord, we pray you to proceed,
	And justly and religiously unfold
	Why the law Salique that they have in France
	Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim.
	And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
	That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
	Or nicely charge your understanding soul
	With opening titles miscreate, whose right
	Suits not in native colours with the truth;
	For God doth know how many now in health
	Shall drop their blood in approbation
	Of what your reverence shall incite us to.
	Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,
	How you awake the sleeping sword of war:
	We charge you in the name of God, take heed;
	For never two such kingdoms did contend
	Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops
	Are every one a woe, a sore complaint,
	'Gainst him whose wrongs give edge unto the swords
	That make such waste in brief mortality.
	Under this conjuration speak, my lord,
	And we will hear, note, and believe in heart,
	That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
	As pure as sin with baptism.
</K. HENRY>

<CANTERBURY>	<5%>
	Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,
	That owe yourselves, your lives, and services
	To this imperial throne. There is no bar
	To make against your highness' claim to France
	But this, which they produce from Pharamond,
	In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant,
	'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'
	Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
	To be the realm of France, and Pharamond
	The founder of this law and female bar.
	Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
	That the land Salique is in Germany,
	Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;
	Where Charles the Great, having subdu'd the Saxons,
	There left behind and settled certain French;
	Who, holding in disdain the German women
	For some dishonest manners of their life,
	Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female
	Should be inheritrix in Salique land:
	Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,
	Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.
	Then doth it well appear the Salique law
	Was not devised for the realm of France;
	Nor did the French possess the Salique land
	Until four hundred one-and-twenty years
	After defunction of King Pharamond,
	Idly suppos'd the founder of this law;
	Who died within the year of our redemption
	Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
	Subdu'd the Saxons, and did seat the French
	Beyond the river Sala, in the year
	Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
	King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,
	Did, as heir general, being descended
	Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,
	Make claim and title to the crown of France.
	Hugh Capet also, who usurp'd the crown
	Of Charles the Duke of Loraine, sole heir male
	Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
	To find his title with some shows of truth,—
	Though in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,—
	Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,
	Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son
	To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son
	Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,
	Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,
	Could not keep quiet in his conscience,
	Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied
	That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,
	Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,
	Daughter to Charles the aforesaid Duke of Loraine:
	By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
	Was re-united to the crown of France.
	So that, as clear as is the summer's sun,
	King Pepin's title, and Hugh Capet's claim,
	King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear
	To hold in right and title of the female:
	So do the kings of France unto this day;
	Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
	To bar your highness claiming from the female;
	And rather choose to hide them in a net
	Than amply to imbar their crooked titles
	Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.
</CANTERBURY>

<K. HENRY>	<7%>
	May I with right and conscience make this claim?
</K. HENRY>

<CANTERBURY>	<7%>
	The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!
	For in the book of Numbers is it writ:
	'When the son dies, let the inheritance
	Descend unto the daughter.' Gracious lord,
	Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;
	Look back into your mighty ancestors:
	Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,
	From whom you claim; invoke his war-like spirit,
	And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,
	Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,
	Making defeat on the full power of France;
	Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
	Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
	Forage in blood of French nobility.
	O noble English! that could entertain
	With half their forces the full pride of France,
	And let another half stand laughing by,
	All out of work, and cold for action.
</CANTERBURY>

<ELY>	<8%>
	Awake remembrance of these valiant dead,
	And with your puissant arm renew their feats:
	You are their heir, you sit upon their throne,
	The blood and courage that renowned them
	Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissantliege
	Is in the very May-morn of his youth,
	Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.
</ELY>

	Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth

	They know your Grace hath cause and means and might;
	So hath your highness; never King of England

	And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.
</WESTMORELAND>

<CANTERBURY>	<8%>
	O! let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
	With blood and sword and fire to win your right;
	In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
	Will raise your highness such a mighty sum
	As never did the clergy at one time
	Bring in to any of your ancestors.
</CANTERBURY>

<K. HENRY>	<8%>
	We must not only arm to invade the French,
	But lay down our proportions to defend
	Against the Scot, who will make road upon us
	With all advantages.
</K. HENRY>

<CANTERBURY>	<8%>
	They of those marches, gracious sovereign,
	Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
	Our inland from the pilfering borderers.
</CANTERBURY>

<K. HENRY>	<8%>
	We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,
	But fear the main intendment of the Scot,
	Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;
	For you shall read that my great-grandfather
	Never went with his forces into France
	But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
	Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,
	With ample and brim fulness of his force,
	Galling the gleaned land with hot essays,
	Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;
	That England, being empty of defence,
	Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.
</K. HENRY>

<CANTERBURY>	<9%>
	She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;
	For hear her but exampled by herself:
	When all her chivalry hath been in France
	And she a mourning widow of her nobles,
	She hath herself not only well defended,
	But taken and impounded as a stray
	The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,
	To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings,
	And make your chronicle as rich with praise
	As is the owse and bottom of the sea
	With sunken wrack and sumless treasuries.
</CANTERBURY>

<WESTMORELAND>	<9%>
	But there's a saying very old and true;

	If that you will France win,
	Then with Scotland first begin:

	For once the eagle England being in prey,
	To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
	Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,
	Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,
	To tear and havoc more than she can eat.
</WESTMORELAND>

<EXETER>	<9%>
	It follows then the cat must stay at home:
	Yet that is but a crush'd necessity;
	Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries
	And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.
	While that the armed hand doth fight abroad
	The advised head defends itself at home:
	For government, though high and low and lower,
	Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,
	Congreeing in a full and natural close,
	Like music.

<CANTERBURY>	<9%>
	Therefore doth heaven divide
	The state of man in divers functions,
	Setting endeavour in continual motion;
	To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,
	Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,
	Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
	The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
	They have a king and officers of sorts;
	Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,
	Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
	Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,
	Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds;
	Which pillage they with merry march bring home
	To the tent-royal of their emperor:
	Who, busied in his majesty, surveys
	The singing masons building roofs of gold,
	The civil citizens kneading up the honey,
	The poor mechanic porters crowding in
	Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,
	The sad-ey'd justice, with his surly hum,
	Delivering o'er to executors pale
	The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,
	That many things, having full reference
	To one consent, may work contrariously;
	As many arrows, loosed several ways,
	Fly to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;
	As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;
	As many lines close in the dial's centre;
	So may a thousand actions, once afoot,
	End in one purpose, and be all well borne
	Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.
	Divide your happy England into four;
	Whereof take you one quarter into France,
	And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
	If we, with thrice such powers left at home,
	Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,
	Let us be worried and our nation lose
	The name of hardiness and policy.

	Ruling in large and ample empery

</K. HENRY>
	Your greeting is from him, not from the king.
<AMBASSADOR 1>	<11%>
	May't please your majesty to give us leave
	Freely to render what we have in charge;
	Or shall we sparingly show you far off
	The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?
</AMBASSADOR 1>

<K. HENRY>	<11%>
	We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;
	Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
	As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:
	Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
	Tell us the Dauphin's mind.
</K. HENRY>

<AMBASSADOR 1>	<11%>
	Thus then, in few.
	Your highness, lately sending into France,
	Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right
	Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.
	In answer of which claim, the prince our master
	Says that you savour too much of your youth,
	And bids you be advis'd there's nought in France
	That can be with a nimble galliard won;
	You cannot revel into dukedoms there.
	He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,
	This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,
	Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
	Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.
</AMBASSADOR 1>

<K. HENRY>	<12%>
	What treasure, uncle?
</K. HENRY>

<EXETER>	<12%>
	Tennis-balls, my liege.
</EXETER>

<K. HENRY>	<12%>
	We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us:
	His present and your pains we thank you for:
	When we have match'd our rackets to these balls,
	We will in France, by God's grace, play a set
	Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.
	Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
	That all the courts of France will be disturb'd
	With chaces. And we understand him well,
	How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,
	Not measuring what use we made of them.
	We never valu'd this poor seat of England;
	And therefore, living hence, did give ourself
	To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common
	That men are merriest when they are from home.
	But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,
	Be like a king and show my sail of greatness
	When I do rouse me in my throne of France:
	For that I have laid by my majesty
	And plodded like a man for working-days,
	But I will rise there with so full a glory
	That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,
	Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
	And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
	Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul
	Shall stand sore-charged for the wasteful vengeance
	That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows
	Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;
	Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;
	And some are yet ungotten and unborn
	That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
	But this lies all within the will of God,
	To whom I do appeal; and in whose name
	Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,
	To venge me as I may and to put forth
	My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.
	So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin
	His jest will savour but of shallow wit
	When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.
	Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.

	Therefore let our proportions for these wars

<CHORUS>	<13%>
	Now all the youth of England are on fire,
	And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies;
	Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought
	Reigns solely in the breast of every man:
	They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,
	Following the mirror of all Christian kings,
	With winged heels, as English Mercuries.
	For now sits Expectation in the air
	And hides a sword from hilts unto the point
	With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,
	Promis'd to Harry and his followers.
	The French, advis'd by good intelligence
	Of this most dreadful preparation,
	Shake in their fear, and with pale policy
	Seek to divert the English purposes.
	O England! model to thy inward greatness,
	Like little body with a mighty heart,
	What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,
	Were all thy children kind and natural!
	But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out
	A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
	With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,
	One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,
	Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
	Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,
	Have, for the gilt of France,—O guilt, indeed!—
	Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France;
	And by their hands this grace of kings must die,—
	If hell and treason hold their promises,—
	Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.
	Linger your patience on; and well digest
	The abuse of distance while we force a play.
	The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;
	The king is set from London; and the scene
	Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton:
	There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:
	And thence to France shall we convey you safe,
	And bring you back, charming the narrow seas
	To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,
	We'll not offend one stomach with our play.
	But, till the king come forth and not till then,
	Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.

<NYM>	<15%>
	Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.
</NYM>

<BARDOLPH>	<15%>
	What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?
</BARDOLPH>

<NYM>	<15%>
	For my part, I care not: I say little; but when time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that shall be as it may. I dare not fight; but I will wink and hold out mine iron. It is a simple one; but what though? it will toast cheese, and it will endure cold as another man's sword will: and there's an end.
</NYM>

<BARDOLPH>	<15%>
	I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends, and we'll be all three sworn brothers to France: let it be so, good Corporal Nym.
</BARDOLPH>

<NYM>	<15%>
	Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the certain of it; and when I cannot live any longer, I will do as I may: that is my rest, that is the rendezvous of it.

<BARDOLPH>	<15%>
	It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell Quickly; and, certainly she did you wrong, for you were troth-plight to her.
</BARDOLPH>

<NYM>	<15%>
	I cannot tell; things must be as they may: men may sleep, and they may have their throats about them at that time; and, some say, knives have edges. It must be as it may: though patience be a tired mare, yet she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I cannot tell.

	Now, by this hand, I swear, I scorn the term;
	Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.

<HOSTESS>	<16%>
	No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot lodge and board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live honestly by the prick of their needles, but it will be thought we keep a bawdy-house straight. [<NYM AND PISTOL DRAW.] O WELL-A-DAY LADY! IF HE BE...>

	And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!
	I do retort the solus in thy bowels;
	For I can take, and Pistol's cock is up,
	And flashing fire will follow.
</PISTOL>

<NYM>	<16%>
	I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me. I have an humour to knock you indifferently well. If you grow foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with my rapier, as I may, in fair terms: if you would walk off, I would prick your guts a little, in good terms, as I may; and that's the humour of it.

	Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,

<Trumpets sound. Enter King Henry, Scroop, Cambridge, Grey, Lords, and Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
<K. HENRY>	<19%>
	Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
	My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,
	And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts:
	Think you not that the powers we bear with us
	Will cut their passage through the force of France,
	Doing the execution and the act
	For which we have in head assembled them?
</K. HENRY>

<SCROOP>	<19%>
	No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.
</SCROOP>

<K. HENRY>	<19%>
	I doubt not that; since we are well persuaded
	We carry not a heart with us from hence
	That grows not in a fair consent with ours;
	Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
	Success and conquest to attend on us.
</K. HENRY>

<CAMBRIDGE>	<19%>
	Never was monarch better fear'd and lov'd
	Than is your majesty: there's not, I think, a subject
	That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness
	Under the sweet shade of your government.
</CAMBRIDGE>

<GREY>	<19%>
	True: those that were your father's enemies
	Have steep'd their galls in honey, and do serve you
	With hearts create of duty and of zeal.
</GREY>

<K. HENRY>	<20%>
	We therefore have great cause of thankfulness,
	And shall forget the office of our hand,
	Sooner than quittance of desert and merit
	According to the weight and worthiness.
</K. HENRY>

<SCROOP>	<20%>
	So service shall with steeled sinews toil,
	And labour shall refresh itself with hope,
	To do your Grace incessant services.
</SCROOP>

<K. HENRY>	<20%>
	We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,
	Enlarge the man committed yesterday
	That rail'd against our person: we consider
	It was excess of wine that set him on;
	And on his more advice we pardon him.
</K. HENRY>

<SCROOP>	<20%>
	That's mercy, but too much security:
	Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest example
	Breed, by his sufference, more of such a kind.
</SCROOP>

<K. HENRY>	<20%>
	O! let us yet be merciful.
</K. HENRY>

<CAMBRIDGE>	<20%>
	So may your highness, and yet punish too.

	Sir,
	You show great mercy, if you give him life
	After the taste of much correction.
</GREY>

<K. HENRY>	<20%>
	Alas! your too much love and care of me
	Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch.
	If little faults, proceeding on distemper,
	Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye
	When capital crimes, chew'd, swallow'd, and digested,
	Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,
	Though Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey, in their dear care,
	And tender preservation of our person,
	Would have him punish'd. And now to our French causes:
	Who are the late commissioners?
</K. HENRY>

<CAMBRIDGE>	<20%>

	Then, Richard, Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;

	Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:
	Read them; and know, I know your worthiness.
	My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,
	We will aboard to-night. Why, how now, gentlemen!
	What see you in those papers that you lose
	So much complexion? Look ye, how they change!
	Their cheeks are paper. Why, what read you there,
	That hath so cowarded and chas'd your blood
	Out of appearance?
</K. HENRY>

<CAMBRIDGE>	<21%>
	I do confess my fault,
	And do submit me to your highness' mercy.
</CAMBRIDGE>

	To which we all appeal.
</GREY>

<SCROOP>	<21%>
	To which we all appeal.
</SCROOP>

<K. HENRY>	<21%>
	The mercy that was quick in us but late
	By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:
	You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;
	For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,
	As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.
	See you, my princes and my noble peers,
	These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,
	You know how apt our love was to accord
	To furnish him with all appertinents
	Belonging to his honour; and this man
	Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspir'd,
	And sworn unto the practices of France,
	To kill us here in Hampton: to the which
	This knight, no less for bounty bound to us
	Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But O!
	What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,
	Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!
	Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,
	That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,
	That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold
	Wouldst thou have practis'd on me for thy use!
	May it be possible that foreign hire
	Could out of thee extract one spark of evil
	That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange
	That, though the truth of it stands off as gross
	As black from white, my eye will scarcely see it.
	Treason and murder ever kept together,
	As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,
	Working so grossly in a natural cause
	That admiration did not whoop at them:
	But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in
	Wonder to wait on treason and on murder:
	And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
	That wrought upon thee so preposterously
	Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:
	And other devils that suggest by treasons
	Do botch and bungle up damnation
	With patches, colours, and with forms, being fetch'd
	From glistering semblances of piety;
	But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,
	Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,
	Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.
	If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
	Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,
	He might return to vasty Tartar back,
	And tell the legions, 'I can never win
	A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'
	O! how hast thou with jealousy infected
	The sweetness of affiance. Show men dutiful?
	Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?
	Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?
	Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?
	Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,
	Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,
	Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,
	Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,
	Not working with the eye without the ear,
	And but in purged judgment trusting neither?
	Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:
	And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,
	To mark the full-fraught man and best indu'd
	With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;
	For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like
	Another fall of man. Their faults are open:
	Arrest them to the answer of the law;
	And God acquit them of their practices!
</K. HENRY>

	I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Richard Earl of Cambridge.

<CAMBRIDGE>	<23%>
	For me, the gold of France did not seduce,
	Although I did admit it as a motive

	Which I in sufference heartily will rejoice,
	Beseeching God and you to pardon me.
</CAMBRIDGE>

<GREY>	<23%>
	Never did faithful subject more rejoice
	At the discovery of most dangerous treason
	Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself,
	Prevented from a damned enterprise.
	My fault, but not my body; pardon, sovereign.
</GREY>

<K. HENRY>	<23%>
	God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.
	You have conspir'd against our royal person,
	Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd, and from his coffers
	Receiv'd the golden earnest of our death;
	Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,
	His princes and his peers to servitude,
	His subjects to oppression and contempt,
	And his whole kingdom into desolation.
	Touching our person seek we no revenge;
	But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,
	Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws
	We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,
	Poor miserable wretches, to your death;
	The taste whereof, God of his mercy give you
	Patience to endure, and true repentance
	Of all your dear offences! Bear them hence.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey, guarded.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Now, lords, for France! the enterprise whereof
	Shall be to you, as us, like glorious.
	We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,
	Since God so graciously hath brought to light
	This dangerous treason lurking in our way
	To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now
	But every rub is smoothed on our way.
	Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver
	Our puissance into the hand of God,
	Putting it straight in expedition.
	Cheerly to sea! the signs of war advance:
	No king of England, if not king of France.

'How now, Sir John!' quoth I: 'what man! be of good cheer.' So a' cried out 'God, God, God!' three or four times: now I, to comfort him, bid him a' should not think of God, I hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet.

	As waters to the sucking of a gulf.

	Left by the fatal and neglected English
	Upon our fields.

	My most redoubted father,
	It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;
	For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,—
	Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,—
	But that defences, musters, preparations,
	Should be maintain'd, assembled, and collected,
	As were a war in expectation.
	Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forth
	To view the sick and feeble parts of France:
	And let us do it with no show of fear;
	No, with no more than if we heard that England
	Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:
	For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,
	Her sceptre so fantastically borne
	By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,
	That fear attends her not.
</DAUPHIN>

<CONSTABLE>	<27%>
	O peace, Prince Dauphin!
	You are too much mistaken in this king.
	Question your Grace the late ambassadors,
	With what great state he heard their embassy,
	How well supplied with noble counsellors,
	How modest in exception, and, withal
	How terrible in constant resolution,
	And you shall find his vanities forespent
	Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,
	Covering discretion with a coat of folly;
	As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
	That shall first spring and be most delicate.
</CONSTABLE>

<DAUPHIN>	<27%>
	Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable;
	But though we think it so, it is no matter:
	In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh
	The enemy more mighty than he seems:
	So the proportions of defence are fill'd;
	Which of a weak and niggardly projection
	Doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting
	A little cloth.
</DAUPHIN>

<FRENCH KING>	<27%>
	Think we King Harry strong;
	And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.
	The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us,
	And he is bred out of that bloody strain
	That haunted us in our familiar paths:
	Witness our too much memorable shame
	When Cressy battle fatally was struck
	And all our princes captiv'd by the hand
	Of that black name, Edward Black Prince of Wales;
	Whiles that his mounting sire, on mountain standing,
	Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,
	Saw his heroical seed, and smil'd to see him
	Mangle the work of nature, and deface
	The patterns that by God and by French fathers
	Had twenty years been made. This is a stem
	Of that victorious stock; and let us fear
	The native mightiness and fate of him.

	By custom and the ordinance of times
	Unto the crown of France. That you may know
	'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,
	Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,
	Nor from the dust of old oblivion rak'd,
	He sends you this most memorable line,
<STAGE DIR>
<Gives a pedigree.>
</STAGE DIR>
	In every branch truly demonstrative;
	Willing you overlook this pedigree;
	And when you find him evenly deriv'd
	From his most fam'd of famous ancestors,
	Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
	Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held
	From him the native and true challenger.
</EXETER>

<FRENCH KING>	<29%>
	Or else what follows?
</FRENCH KING>

<EXETER>	<29%>
	Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown
	Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:
	Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,
	In thunder and in earthquake like a Jove,
	That, if requiring fail, he will compel;
	And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,
	Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy
	On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
	Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head
	Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries,
	The dead men's blood, the pining maidens' groans,
	For husbands, fathers, and betrothed lovers,
	That shall be swallow'd in this controversy.
	This is his claim, his threat'ning, and my message;
	Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,
	To whom expressly I bring greeting too.
</EXETER>

</DAUPHIN>

<EXETER>	<30%>
	Scorn and defiance, slight regard, contempt,
	And anything that may not misbecome
	The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
	Thus says my king: an if your father's highness
	Do not, in grant of all demands at large,
	Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,
	He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,
	That caves and womby vaultages of France
	Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
	In second accent of his ordinance.
</EXETER>

<DAUPHIN>	<30%>
	Say, if my father render fair return,
	It is against my will; for I desire
	Nothing but odds with England: to that end,
	As matching to his youth and vanity,
	I did present him with the Paris balls.
</DAUPHIN>

<EXETER>	<30%>
	He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,
	Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:
	And, be assur'd, you'll find a difference—
	As we his subjects have in wonder found—
	Between the promise of his greener days
	And these he masters now. Now he weighs time
	Even to the utmost grain; that you shall read
	In your own losses, if he stay in France.
</EXETER>

<FRENCH KING>	<30%>
	To-morrow shall you know our mind at full.
</FRENCH KING>

	Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king
	Come here himself to question our delay;
	For he is footed in this land already.

	Thus with imagin'd wing our swift scene flies
	In motion of no less celerity

	The well-appointed king at Hampton pier
	Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
	With silken streamers the young Phœbus fanning:
	Play with your fancies, and in them behold
	Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;
	Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
	To sounds confus'd; behold the threaden sails,
	Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,
	Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,
	Breasting the lofty surge. O! do but think
	You stand upon the rivage and behold
	A city on the inconstant billows dancing;
	For so appears this fleet majestical,
	Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow!
	Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,
	And leave your England, as dead midnight still,
	Guarded with grandsires, babies, and old women,
	Either past or not arriv'd to pith and puissance:
	For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'd
	With one appearing hair, that will not follow
	Those call'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?
	Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;
	Behold the ordenance on their carriages,
	With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.
	Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;
	Tells Harry that the king doth offer him
	Katharine his daughter; and with her, to dowry,
	Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms:
	The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner

	As modest stillness and humility:
	But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
	Then imitate the action of the tiger;
	Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
	Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
	Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
	Let it pry through the portage of the head
	Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it
	As fearfully as doth a galled rock
	O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,
	Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.
	Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,
	Hold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit
	To his full height! On, on, you noblest English!
	Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof;
	Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,
	Have in these parts from morn till even fought,
	And sheath'd their swords for lack of argument.
	Dishonour not your mothers; now attest
	That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.
	Be copy now to men of grosser blood,
	And teach them how to war. And you, good yeomen,
	Whose limbs were made in England, show us here
	The mettle of your pasture; let us swear
	That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;
	For there is none of you so mean and base
	That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.
	I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,

	As young as I am, I have observed these three swashers. I am boy to them all three, but all they three, though they would serve me, could not be man to me; for, indeed three such antiques do not amount to a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and red-faced; by the means whereof, a' faces it out, but fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath heard that men of few words are the best men; and therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a' should be thought a coward: but his few bad words are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never broke any man's head but his own, and that was against a post when he was drunk. They will steal any thing and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for three half-pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a fire-shovel;—I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals,—they would have me as familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood if I should take from another's pocket to put into mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I must leave them and seek some better service: their villany goes against my weak stomach, and therefore I must cast it up.

	A name that in my thoughts, becomes me best,—
	If I begin the battery once again,
	I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur
	Till in her ashes she lie buried.
	The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,
	And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,
	In liberty of bloody hand shall range
	With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass
	Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.
	What is it then to me, if impious war,
	Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends,
	Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
	Enlink'd to waste and desolation?
	What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause,
	If your pure maidens fall into the hand
	Of hot and forcing violation?
	What rein can hold licentious wickedness
	When down the hill he holds his fierce career?
	We may as bootless spend our vain command
	Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
	As send precepts to the leviathan

	Take pity of your town and of your people,
	Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;
	Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
	O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds
	Of heady murder, spoil, and villany.
	If not, why, in a moment, look to see
	The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
	Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;
	Your fathers taken by the silver beards,
	And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls;
	Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,
	Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confus'd
	Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry
	At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.

	And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,
	Seem frosty? O! for honour of our land,

	The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon:

	The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon; and a man that I love and honour with my soul, and my heart, and my duty, and my life, and my living, and my uttermost power: he is not—God be praised and plessed!—any hurt in the world; but keeps the pridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline. There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the pridge, I think, in my very conscience, he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony; and he is a man of no estimation in the world; but I did see him do as gallant service.

	Bardolph, a soldier firm and sound of heart,

	That goddess blind,
	That stands upon the rolling restless stone,—
</PISTOL>

<FLUELLEN>	<44%>
	By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is painted plind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to signify to you that Fortune is plind: and she is painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which is the moral of it, that she is turning, and inconstant, and mutability, and variation: and her foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone, which rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth, the poet makes a most excellent description of it: Fortune is an excellent moral.
</FLUELLEN>

<PISTOL>	<44%>
	Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;
	For he hath stol'n a pax, and hanged must a' be,
	A damned death!
	Let gallows gape for dog, let man go free
	And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate.
	But Exeter hath given the doom of death
	For pax of little price.
	Therefore, go speak; the duke will hear thy voice;
	And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut
	With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:
	Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.
</PISTOL>

<FLUELLEN>	<44%>
	Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.
</FLUELLEN>

<PISTOL>	<44%>
	Why then, rejoice therefore.
</PISTOL>

<FLUELLEN>	<44%>
	Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice at; for, if, look you, he were my brother, I would desire the duke to use his good pleasure and put him to execution; for discipline ought to be used.

<GOWER>	<45%>
	Why, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then goes to the wars to grace himself at his return into London under the form of a soldier. And such fellows are perfect in the great commanders' names, and they will learn you by rote where services were done; at such and such a sconce, at such a breach, at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was shot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on; and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war, which they trick up with new-tuned oaths: and what a beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and ale-washed wits, is wonderful to be thought on. But you must learn to know such slanders of the age, or else you may be marvellously mistook.
</GOWER>

<FLUELLEN>	<45%>

</K. HENRY>

<FLUELLEN>	<46%>
	The perdition of th' athversary hath been very great, reasonable great: marry, for my part, I think the duke hath lost never a man but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church; one Bardolph, if your majesty know the man: his face is all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o' fire; and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red; but his nose is executed, and his fire's out.
</FLUELLEN>

<K. HENRY>	<46%>
	We would have all such offenders so cut off: and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful language; for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is the soonest winner.

	Thus says my king: Say thou to Harry of England: Though we seemed dead, we did but sleep: advantage is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him, we could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him therefore consider of his ransom; which must proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which, in weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under. For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for the effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own person, kneeling at our feet, but a weak and worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers, whose condemnation is pronounced. So far my king and master, so much my office.

<K. HENRY>	<47%>
	Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back,
	And tell thy king I do not seek him now,
	But could be willing to march on to Calais
	Without impeachment; for, to say the sooth,—
	Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much
	Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,—
	My people are with sickness much enfeebled,
	My numbers lessen'd, and those few I have
	Almost no better than so many French:
	Who, when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,
	I thought upon one pair of English legs
	Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,
	That I do brag thus! this your air of France
	Hath blown that vice in me; I must repent.
	Go therefore, tell thy master here I am:
	My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,
	My army but a weak and sickly guard;
	Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,
	Though France himself and such another neighbour
	Stand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy.
	Go, bid thy master well advise himself:
	If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder'd,
	We shall your tawny ground with your red blood
	Discolour: and so, Montjoy, fare you well.
	The sum of all our answer is but this:
	We would not seek a battle as we are;
	Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it:
	So tell your master.

<DAUPHIN>	<49%>
	What a long night is this! I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns. Ça, ha! He bounds from the earth as if his entrails were hairs: le cheval volant, the Pegasus, qui a les narines de feu! When I bestride him, I soar, I am a hawk: he trots the air; the earth sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.
</DAUPHIN>

<ORLEANS>	<49%>
	He's of the colour of the nutmeg.

<DAUPHIN>	<49%>

<CONSTABLE>	<49%>
	Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.

	Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary deserved praise on my palfrey: it is a theme as fluent as the sea; turn the sands into eloquent tongues, and my horse is argument for them all. 'Tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for a sovereign's sovereign to ride on; and for the world—familiar to us, and unknown—to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him. I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus: 'Wonder of nature!'—

	Now entertain conjecture of a time
	When creeping murmur and the poring dark
	Fills the wide vessel of the universe.
	From camp to camp, through the foul womb of night,
	The hum of either army stilly sounds,
	That the fix'd sentinels almost receive
	The secret whispers of each other's watch:
	Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
	Each battle sees the other's umber'd face:
	Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs
	Piercing the night's dull ear; and from the tents
	The armourers, accomplishing the knights,
	With busy hammers closing rivets up,
	Give dreadful note of preparation.
	The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,
	And the third hour of drowsy morning name.
	Proud of their numbers, and secure in soul,
	The confident and over-lusty French
	Do the low-rated English play at dice;
	And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night
	Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp
	So tediously away. The poor condemned English,
	Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires
	Sit patiently, and inly ruminate
	The morning's danger, and their gesture sad
	Investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats
	Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
	So many horrid ghosts. O! now, who will behold
	The royal captain of this ruin'd band
	Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,
	Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'
	For forth he goes and visits all his host,—
	Bids them good morrow with a modest smile,
	And calls them brothers, friends, and countrymen.
	Upon his royal face there is no note
	How dread an army hath enrounded him;
	Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
	Unto the weary and all-watched night:
	But freshly looks and overbears attaint
	With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;
	That every wretch, pining and pale before,
	Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks,
	A largess universal, like the sun
	His liberal eye doth give to every one,
	Thawing cold fear. Then mean and gentle all,
	Behold, as may unworthiness define,
	A little touch of Harry in the night.
	And so our scene must to the battle fly;
	Where,—O for pity,—we shall much disgrace,
	With four or five most vile and ragged foils,
	Right ill dispos'd in brawl ridiculous,
	The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see;
	Minding true things by what their mockeries be.

<K. HENRY>	<57%>
	Even as men wracked upon a sand, that look to be washed off the next tide.
</K. HENRY>

<BATES>	<57%>
	He hath not told his thought to the king?
</BATES>

<K. HENRY>	<57%>
	No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me; the element shows to him as it doth to me; all his senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and though his affections are higher mounted than ours, yet when they stoop, they stoop with the like wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army.
</K. HENRY>

<BATES>	<58%>
	He may show what outward courage he will, but I believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck, and so I would he were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.
</BATES>

<K. HENRY>	<58%>
	By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king: I think he would not wish himself any where but where he is.
</K. HENRY>

<BATES>	<58%>
	Then I would he were here alone; so should he be sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.
</BATES>

<K. HENRY>	<58%>
	I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's minds. Methinks I could not die any where so contented as in the king's company, his cause being just and his quarrel honourable.
</K. HENRY>

<WILLIAMS>	<58%>
	That's more than we know.
</WILLIAMS>

<BATES>	<58%>
	Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know enough if we know we are the king's subjects. If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us.
</BATES>

<WILLIAMS>	<58%>
	But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make; when all those legs and arms and heads, chopped off in a battle, shall join together at the latter day, and cry all, 'We died at such a place;' some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle; for how can they charitably dispose of any thing when blood is their argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it, whom to disobey were against all proportion of subjection.
</WILLIAMS>

<K. HENRY>	<59%>
	So, if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule, should be imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a servant, under his master's command transporting a sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the business of the master the author of the servant's damnation. But this is not so: the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant; for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services. Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers. Some, peradventure, have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder; some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment, though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God: war is his beadle, war is his vengeance; so that here men are punished for before-breach of the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where they feared the death they have borne life away, and where they would be safe they perish. Then, if they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited. Every subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every mote out of his conscience; and dying so, death is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained: and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think, that making God so free an offer, he let him outlive that day to see his greatness, and to teach others how they should prepare.

</K. HENRY>

<WILLIAMS>	<60%>

	The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp
	That beats upon the high shore of this world,
	No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,
	Not all these, laid in bed majestical,
	Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,
	Who with a body fill'd and vacant mind
	Gets him to rest, cramm'd with distressful bread;
	Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,
	But, like a lackey, from the rise to set
	Sweats in the eye of Phœbus, and all night
	Sleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn,
	Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,
	And follows so the ever-running year
	With profitable labour to his grave:
	And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,
	Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,
	Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.

	The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them.
	'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords,

	Who in unnecessary action swarm
	About our squares of battle, were enow
	To purge this field of such a hilding foe,

	Took stand for idle speculation:
	But that our honours must not. What's to say?
	A very little little let us do,
	And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound
	The tucket sonance and the note to mount:
	For our approach shall so much dare the field,
	That England shall couch down in fear and yield.

	To do our country loss; and if to live,
	The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
	God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.
	By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,
	Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
	It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
	Such outward things dwell not in my desires:
	But if it be a sin to covet honour,
	I am the most offending soul alive.
	No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:
	God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour
	As one man more, methinks, would share from me,
	For the best hope I have. O! do not wish one more:
	Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,
	That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
	Let him depart; his passport shall be made,
	And crowns for convoy put into his purse:
	We would not die in that man's company
	That fears his fellowship to die with us.
	This day is call'd the feast of Crispian:
	He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
	Will stand a tip-toe when this day is nam'd,
	And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
	He that shall live this day, and see old age,
	Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,
	And say, 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'
	Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars,
	And say, 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'
	Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,
	But he'll remember with advantages
	What feats he did that day. Then shall our names,
	Familiar in his mouth as household words,
	Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,
	Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,
	Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.
	This story shall the good man teach his son;
	And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
	From this day to the ending of the world,
	But we in it shall be remembered;
	We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
	For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
	Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile
	This day shall gentle his condition:
	And gentlemen in England, now a-bed

If you mark Alexander's life well, Harry of Monmouth's life is come after it indifferent well; for there is figures in all things. Alexander,—God knows, and you know,—in his rages, and his furies, and his wraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and his displeasures, and his indignations, and also being a little intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and his angers, look you, kill his pest friend, Cleitus.

	Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story,

	I humbly pray them to admit the excuse
	Of time, of numbers, and due course of things,
	Which cannot in their huge and proper life
	Be here presented. Now we bear the king
	Toward Calais: grant him there; there seen,
	Heave him away upon your winged thoughts
	Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach
	Pales in the flood with men, with wives, and boys,
	Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep-mouth'd sea,
	Which, like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king,
	Seems to prepare his way: so let him land
	And solemnly see him set on to London.
	So swift a pace hath thought that even now
	You may imagine him upon Blackheath;
	Where that his lords desire him to have borne
	His bruised helmet and his bended sword
	Before him through the city: he forbids it,
	Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride;
	Giving full trophy, signal and ostent,
	Quite from himself, to God. But now behold,
	In the quick forge and working-house of thought,
	How London doth pour out her citizens.
	The mayor and all his brethren in best sort,
	Like to the senators of the antique Rome,
	With the plebeians swarming at their heels,
	Go forth and fetch their conquering Cæsar in:
	As, by a lower but loving likelihood,
	Were now the general of our gracious empress,—
	As in good time he may,—from Ireland coming,
	Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,
	How many would the peaceful city quit
	To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,
	Did they this Harry. Now in London place him;
	As yet the lamentation of the French
	Invites the King of England's stay at home,—
	The emperor's coming in behalf of France,
	To order peace between them;—and omit
	All the occurrences, whatever chanc'd,
	Till Harry's back-return again to France:
	There must we bring him; and myself have play'd
	The interim, by remembering you 'tis past.

	That face to face, and royal eye to eye,
	You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me
	If I demand before this royal view,
	What rub or what impediment there is,
	Why that the naked, poor, and mangled Peace,
	Dear nurse of arts, plenties, and joyful births,
	Should not in this best garden of the world,
	Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?
	Alas! she hath from France too long been chas'd,
	And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,
	Corrupting in its own fertility.
	Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,
	Unpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach'd,
	Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,
	Put forth disorder'd twigs; her fallow leas
	The darnel, hemlock and rank fumitory
	Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts
	That should deracinate such savagery;
	The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth
	The freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover,
	Wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank,
	Conceives by idleness, and nothing teems
	But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,
	Losing both beauty and utility;
	And as our vineyards, fallows, meads, and hedges,
	Defective in their natures, grow to wildness,
	Even so our houses and ourselves and children
	Have lost, or do not learn for want of time,
	The sciences that should become our country,
	But grow like savages,—as soldiers will,
	That nothing do but meditate on blood,—
	To swearing and stern looks, diffus'd attire,
	And every thing that seems unnatural.
	Which to reduce into our former favour
	You are assembled; and my speech entreats
	That I may know the let why gentle Peace
	Should not expel these inconveniences,
	And bless us with her former qualities.

	The princess is the better Englishwoman. I' faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am glad thou canst speak no better English; for, if thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but directly to say 'I love you:' then, if you urge me further than to say 'Do you in faith?' I wear out my suit. Give me your answer; i' faith do: and so clap hands and a bargain. How say you, lady?
</K. HENRY>

<KATHARINE>	<92%>
	Sauf vostre honneur, me understand vell.
</KATHARINE>

<K. HENRY>	<92%>
	Marry, if you would put me to verses, or to dance for your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in strength. If I could win a lady at leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my armour on my back, under the correction of bragging be it spoken, I should quickly leap into a wife. Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But before God, Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation; only downright oaths, which I never use till urged, nor never break for urging. If thou caust love a fellow of this temper, Kate. whose face is not worth sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: if thou canst love me for this, take me; if not, to say to thee that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy, for he perforce must do thee right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other places; for these fellows of infinite tongue, that can rime themselves into ladies' favours, they do always reason themselves out again. What! a speaker is but a prater; a rime is but a ballad. A good leg will fall, a straight back will stoop, a black beard will turn white, a curled pate will grow bald, a fair face will wither, a full eye will wax hollow, but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly. If thou would have such a one, take me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier, take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love? speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.

	No; it is not possible you should love the enemy of France, Kate; but, in loving me, you should love the friend of France; for I love France so well, that I will not part with a village of it; I will have it all mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am yours, then yours is France and you are mine.
</K. HENRY>

<KATHARINE>	<93%>

	No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married wife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook off. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand vous avez le possession de moy,—let me see, what then? Saint Denis be my speed!—donc vostre est France, et vous estes mienne. It is as easy for me, Kate, to conquer the kingdom, as to speak so much more French: I shall never move thee in French, unless it be to laugh at me.

	Sauf vostre honneur, le François que vous parlez est meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle.

<K. HENRY>	<94%>
	No, faith, is't not, Kate; but thy speaking of my tongue, and I thine, most truly falsely, must needs be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou understand thus much English, Canst thou love me?
</K. HENRY>

<KATHARINE>	<94%>
	I cannot tell.
</KATHARINE>

<K. HENRY>	<94%>
	Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I'll ask them. Come, I know thou lovest me; and at night when you come into your closet you'll question this gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart: but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the rather, gentle princess, because I love thee cruelly. If ever thou be'st mine, Kate,—as I have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt,—I get thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier-breeder. Shall not thou and I, between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a boy, half French, half English, that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard? shall we not? what sayest thou, my fair flower-de-luce?
</K. HENRY>

<KATHARINE>	<94%>
	I do not know dat.
</KATHARINE>

<K. HENRY>	<95%>
	No; 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: do but now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your French part of such a boy, and for my English moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer you, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon très cher et divine déesse?

<KATHARINE>	<95%>
	Your majesté ave fausse French enough to deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en France.

<K. HENRY>	<95%>
	Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in true English I love thee, Kate: by which honour I dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage. Now beshrew my father's ambition! he was thinking of civil wars when he got me: therefore was I created with a stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when I come to woo ladies I fright them. But, in faith, Kate, the elder I wax the better I shall appear: my comfort is, that old age, that ill layer-up of beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face: thou hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better. And therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you have me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress; take me by the hand, and say 'Harry of England, I am thine:' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud—'England is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry Plantagenet is thine;' who, though I speak it before his face, if he be not fellow with the best king, thou shalt find the best king of good fellows. Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice is music, and thy English broken; therefore, queen of all, Katharine, break thy mind to me in broken English: wilt thou have me?

	O Kate! nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country's fashion: we are the makers of manners, Kate; and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouths of all find-faults, as I will do yours, for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss: therefore, patiently, and yielding <STAGE DIR>

</K. HENRY>

</BURGUNDY>

<K. HENRY>	<97%>
	Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not smooth; so that, having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her, that he will appear in his true likeness.
</K. HENRY>

<BURGUNDY>	<97%>
	Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for that. If you would conjure in her, you must make a circle; if conjure up Love in her in his true likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you blame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid to consign to.

<K. HENRY>	<97%>
	Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.
</K. HENRY>

<BURGUNDY>	<97%>
	I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will teach her to know my meaning: for maids, well summered and warm kept, are like flies at Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their eyes; and then they will endure handling, which before would not abide looking on.
