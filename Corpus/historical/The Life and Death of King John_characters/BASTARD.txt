	Your faithful subject I, a gentleman
	Born in Northamptonshire, and eldest son,
	As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,
	A soldier, by the honour-giving hand
	Of Cœur-de-Lion knighted in the field.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Most certain of one mother, mighty king,
	That is well known: and, as I think, one father:
	But for the certain knowledge of that truth
	I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:
	Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;
	That is my brother's plea and none of mine;
	The which if he can prove, a' pops me out
	At least from fair five hundred pound a year:
	Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	I know not why, except to get the land.
	But once he slander'd me with bastardy:
	But whe'r I be as true-begot or no,
	That still I lay upon my mother's head;
	But that I am as well-begot, my liege,—
	Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!—
	Compare our faces and be judge yourself.
	If old Sir Robert did beget us both,
	And were our father, and this son like him;
	O old Sir Robert, father, on my knee
	I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Because he hath a half-face, like my father.
	With half that face would he have all my land;
	A half-fac'd groat five hundred pound a year!
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:
	Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
	Than was his will to get me, as I think.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Madam, an if my brother had my shape,
	And I had his, Sir Robert his, like him;
	And if my legs were two such riding-rods,
	My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin
	That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
	Lest men should say, 'Look, where three-far-things goes!'
	And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,
	Would I might never stir from off this place,
	I'd give it every foot to have this face:
	I would not be Sir Nob in any case.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.
	Your face hath got five hundred pounds a year,

<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	Brother by the mother's side, give me your hand:
	My father gave me honour, yours gave land.
	Now blessed be the hour, by night or day,
	When I was got, Sir Robert was away!
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?
	Something about, a little from the right,
	In at the window, or else o'er the hatch:
	Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,
	And have is have, however men do catch.
	Near or far off, well won is still well shot,
	And I am I, howe'er I was begot.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!
	For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.
	A foot of honour better than I was,
	But many a many foot of land the worse.
	Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
	'Good den, Sir Richard!' 'God-a-mercy, fellow!'
	And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
	For new-made honour doth forget men's names:
	'Tis too respective and too sociable
	For your conversion. Now your traveller,
	He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,
	And when my knightly stomach is suffic'd,
	Why then I suck my teeth, and catechize
	My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'—
	Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,—
	'I shall beseech you,'—that is question now;
	And then comes answer like an absey-book:
	'O, sir,' says answer, 'at your best command;
	At your employment; at your service, sir:'
	'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'
	And so, ere answer knows what question would,
	Saving in dialogue of compliment,
	And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
	The Pyrenean and the river Po,
	It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
	But this is worshipful society
	And fits the mounting spirit like myself;
	For he is but a bastard to the time,
	That doth not smack of observation;
	And so am I, whether I smack or no;
	And not alone in habit and device,
	Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
	But from the inward motion to deliver
	Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:
	Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
	Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
	For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
	But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
	What woman-post is this? hath she no husband
	That will take pains to blow a horn before her?
	O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!
	What brings you here to court so hastily?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	My brother Robert? old Sir Robert's son?

	There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.
	Madam, I was not old Sir Robert's son:
	Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
	Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast.
	Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,
	Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:
	We know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,
	To whom am I beholding for these limbs?
	Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.
	What! I am dubb'd; I have it on my shoulder.
	But, mother, I am not Sir Robert's son;
	I have disclaim'd Sir Robert and my land;
	Legitimation, name, and all is gone.
	Then, good my mother, let me know my father;
	Some proper man, I hope; who was it, mother?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	As faithfully as I deny the devil.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	Now, by this light, were I to get again,
	Madam, I would not wish a better father.
	Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,
	And so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:
	Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,
	Subjected tribute to commanding love,
	Against whose fury and unmatched force
	The aweless lion could not wage the fight,
	Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.
	He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
	May easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,
	With all my heart I thank thee for my father!
	Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
	When I was got, I'll send his soul to hell.
	Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;
	And they shall say, when Richard me begot,
	If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:
	Who says it was, he lies: I say, 'twas not.

	In undetermin'd differences of kings.
	Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?
	Cry 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field,
	You equal-potents, fiery-kindled spirits!
	Then let confusion of one part confirm
	The other's peace; till then, blows, blood, and death!

	By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,
	And stand securely on their battlements

	At your industrious scenes and acts of death.

	Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,
	Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
	Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town.
	By east and west let France and England mount
	Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,
	Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down
	The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:
	I'd play incessantly upon these jades,
	Even till unfenced desolation
	Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.
	That done, dissever your united strengths,
	And part your mingled colours once again;
	Turn face to face and bloody point to point;
	Then, in a moment, Fortune shall cull forth
	Out of one side her happy minion,
	To whom in favour she shall give the day,
	And kiss him with a glorious victory.

	Smacks it not something of the policy?

	An if thou hast the mettle of a king,
	Being wrong'd as we are by this peevish town,

	As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear
	With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
	That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,
	That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,

	Who having no external thing to lose
	But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,
	That smooth-fac'd gentleman, tickling Commodity,
	Commodity, the bias of the world;
	The world, who of itself is peized well,
	Made to run even upon even ground,
	Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
	This sway of motion, this Commodity,
	Makes it take head from all indifferency,
	From all direction, purpose, course, intent:
	And this same bias, this Commodity,
	This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
	Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,
	Hath drawn him from his own determin'd aid,
	From a resolv'd and honourable war,
	To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
	And why rail I on this Commodity?
	But for because he hath not woo'd me yet.
	Not that I have the power to clutch my hand
	When his fair angels would salute my palm;
	But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
	Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.
	Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail,
	And say there is no sin but to be rich;
	And being rich, my virtue then shall be

	That in your chambers gave you chastisement?
	No! Know, the gallant monarch is in arms,

	To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.
	And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,
	You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
	Of your dear mother England, blush for shame:
	For your own ladies and pale-visag'd maids
	Like Amazons come tripping after drums,

	And so shall you, being beaten. Do but start
	An echo with the clamour of thy drum,
	And even at hand a drum is ready brac'd
	That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;
	Sound but another, and another shall
	As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear
	And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,—
	Not trusting to this halting legate here,
	Whom he hath us'd rather for sport than need,—
	Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits
	A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
	To feast upon whole thousands of the French.
<SPEECH 72><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.
<SPEECH 73><ACT 5><SCENE 6><94%>
	A friend. What art thou?
<SPEECH 74><ACT 5><SCENE 6><94%>
	Whither dost thou go?
<SPEECH 75><ACT 5><SCENE 6><94%>
	Hubert, I think?
<SPEECH 76><ACT 5><SCENE 6><94%>
	Who thou wilt: and if thou please,
	Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
	I come one way of the Plantagenets.
<SPEECH 77><ACT 5><SCENE 6><94%>
	Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?
<SPEECH 78><ACT 5><SCENE 6><94%>
	Brief, then; and what's the news?
<SPEECH 79><ACT 5><SCENE 6><94%>
	Show me the very wound of this ill news:
	I am no woman; I'll not swound at it.
<SPEECH 80><ACT 5><SCENE 6><95%>
	How did he take it? who did taste to him?
<SPEECH 81><ACT 5><SCENE 6><95%>
	Whom didst thou leave to tend his majesty?
<SPEECH 82><ACT 5><SCENE 6><95%>
	Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,
	And tempt us not to bear above our power!
	I'll tell thee, Hubert, half my power this night,
	Passing these flats, are taken by the tide;
	These Lincoln Washes have devoured them:
	Myself, well-mounted, hardly have escap'd.
	Away before! conduct me to the king;
	I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.
<SPEECH 83><ACT 5><SCENE 7><97%>
	O! I am scalded with my violent motion
	And spleen of speed to see your majesty.
<SPEECH 84><ACT 5><SCENE 7><98%>
	The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,
	Where heaven he knows how we shall answer him:
	For in a night the best part of my power,
	As I upon advantage did remove,
	Were in the Washes all unwarily
	Devoured by the unexpected flood.
<SPEECH 85><ACT 5><SCENE 7><98%>
	Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind
	To do the office for thee of revenge,
	And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,
	As it on earth hath been thy servant still.
	Now, now, you stars, that move in your right spheres,
	Where be your powers? Show now your mended faiths,
	And instantly return with me again,
	To push destruction and perpetual shame
	Out of the weak door of our fainting land.
	Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought:
	The Dauphin rages at our very heels.
<SPEECH 86><ACT 5><SCENE 7><99%>
	He will the rather do it when he sees
	Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.
<SPEECH 87><ACT 5><SCENE 7><99%>
	Let it be so. And you, my noble prince,
	With other princes that may best be spar'd,
	Shall wait upon your father's funeral.
<SPEECH 88><ACT 5><SCENE 7><99%>
	Thither shall it then.
	And happily may your sweet self put on
	The lineal state and glory of the land!
	To whom, with all submission, on my knee,
	I do bequeath my faithful services
	And true subjection everlastingly.
<SPEECH 89><ACT 5><SCENE 7><100%>
	O! let us pay the time but needful woe
	Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.
	This England never did, nor never shall,
	Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,
	But when it first did help to wound itself.
	Now these her princes are come home again,
	Come the three corners of the world in arms,
	And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,
	If England to itself do rest but true.
