	Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France,
	In my behaviour, to the majesty,
	The borrow'd majesty of England here.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	Philip of France, in right and true behalf
	Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,
	Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim
	To this fair island and the territories,
	To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine;
	Desiring thee to lay aside the sword
	Which sways usurpingly these several titles,
	And put the same into young Arthur's hand,
	Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	The proud control of fierce and bloody war,
	To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,
	The furthest limit of my embassy.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><13%>
	Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
	And stir them up against a mightier task.
	England, impatient of your just demands,
	Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,
	Whose leisure I have stay'd, have given him time
	To land his legions all as soon as I;
	His marches are expedient to this town,
	His forces strong, his soldiers confident.
	With him along is come the mother-queen,
	An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;
	With her her niece, the Lady Blanch of Spain;
	With them a bastard of the king's deceas'd;
	And all the unsettled humours of the land,
	Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,
	With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens,
	Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,
	Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,
	To make a hazard of new fortunes here.
	In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits
	Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er
	Did never float upon the swelling tide,
	To do offence and scathe in Christendom.
	The interruption of their churlish drums
	Cuts off more circumstance: they are at hand,
	To parley or to fight; therefore prepare.
