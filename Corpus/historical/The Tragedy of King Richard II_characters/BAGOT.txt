	And that's the wavering commons; for their love
	Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them,
	By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.

	No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.
	Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,

	Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
	My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
	Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.
	In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,
	I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,
	That reacheth from the restful English court
	As far as Calais, to my uncle's head?'
	Amongst much other talk, that very time,
	I heard you say that you had rather refuse
	The offer of a hundred thousand crowns
	Than Bolingbroke's return to England;
	Adding withal, how blest this land would be
	In this your cousin's death.
