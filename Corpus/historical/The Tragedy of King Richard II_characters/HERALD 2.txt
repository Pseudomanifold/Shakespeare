<SPEECH 1><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
	On pain to be found false and recreant,
	Both to defend himself and to approve
	Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,
	To God, his sovereign, and to him, disloyal;
	Courageously and with a free desire,
	Attending but the signal to begin.
