	Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake?
	'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?'
	Was it not so?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 5><SCENE 4><93%>
	'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,
	And urg'd it twice together, did he not?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 5><SCENE 4><93%>
	And speaking it, he wistly looked on me,
	As who should say, 'I would thou wert the man
	That would divorce this terror from my heart;'
	Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go:
	I am the king's friend, and will rid his foe.

	As full of valour as of royal blood:
	Both have I spilt; O! would the deed were good;
	For now the devil, that told me I did well,
	Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.
	This dead king to the living king I'll bear.
	Take hence the rest and give them burial here.

	Great king, within this coffin I present
	Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies
	The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,
	Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 5><SCENE 6><99%>
	From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.
