	Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts.
	Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland;
	Expedient manage must be made, my liege,
	Ere further leisure yield them further means
	For their advantage and your highness' loss.

	God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:
	I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 2><36%>
	That he, our hope, might have retir'd his power,
	And driven into despair an enemy's hope,
	Who strongly hath set footing in this land:
	The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,
	And with uplifted arms is safe arriv'd
	At Ravenspurgh.

	Ah! madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,
	The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,
	The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,
	With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 2><36%>
	We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester
	Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,
	And all the household servants fled with him
	To Bolingbroke.

	Here comes the Duke of York.

	Besides, our nearness to the king in love
	Is near the hate of those love not the king.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><39%>
	Well, I'll for refuge straight to Bristol Castle;
	The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><39%>
	Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes
	Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:
	Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.
	Farewell at once; for once, for all, and ever.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	My comfort is, that heaven will take our souls
	And plague injustice with the pains of hell.
