	Pray, sir, be patient: 'tis as much impossible—
	Unless we sweep 'em from the door with cannons—
	To scatter 'em, as 'tis to make 'em sleep
	On May-day morning; which will never be.
	We may as well push against Paul's as stir 'em.

	Alas, I know not; how gets the tide in?
	As much as one sound cudgel of four foot—
	You see the poor remainder—could distribute,
	I made no spare, sir.

	I am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand,
	To mow 'em down before me; but if I spar'd any
	That had a head to hit, either young or old,
	He or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker,
	Let me ne'er hope to see a chine again;
	And that I would not for a cow, God save her!
	</STAGE DIR> Do you hear, Master porter?

	What would you have me do?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
	The spoons will be the bigger, sir. There is a fellow somewhat near the door, he should be a brazier by his face, for, o' my conscience, twenty of the dog days now reign in's nose: all that stand about him are under the line, they need no other penance. That fire-drake did I hit three times on the head, and three times was his nose discharged against me: he stands there, like a mortar-piece, to blow us. There was a haberdasher's wife of small wit near him, that railed upon me till her pinked porringer fell off her head, for kindling such a combustion in the state. I missed the meteor once, and hit that woman, who cried out, 'Clubs!' when I might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to her succour, which were the hope o' the Strand, where she was quartered. They fell on; I made good my place; at length they came to the broomstaff to me; I defied 'em still; when suddenly a file of boys behind 'em, loose shot, delivered such a shower of pebbles, that I was fain to draw mine honour in, and let 'em win the work. The devil was amongst 'em, I think, surely.

	You great fellow,
	Stand close up, or I'll make your head ache.
