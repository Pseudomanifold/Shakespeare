	Very well, my liege.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 4><46%>
	So please your highness,
	The question did at first so stagger me,
	Bearing a state of mighty moment in't,
	And consequence of dread, that I committed
	The daring'st counsel that I had to doubt;
	And did entreat your highness to this course
	Which you are running here.
