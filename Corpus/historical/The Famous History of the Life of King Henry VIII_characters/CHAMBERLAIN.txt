	Is't possible the spells of France should juggle
	Men into such strange mysteries?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	As far as I see, all the good our English
	Have got by the late voyage is but merely
	A fit or two o' the face; but they are shrewd ones;
	For when they hold 'em, you would swear directly
	Their very noses had been counsellors
	To Pepin or Clotharius, they keep state so.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	Death! my lord,
	Their clothes are after such a pagan cut too,
	That, sure, they've worn out Christendom.
	How now!
	What news, Sir Thomas Lovell?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	What is't for?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	I am glad 'tis there: now I would pray our monsieurs
	To think an English courtier may be wise,
	And never see the Louvre.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	What a loss our ladies
	Will have of these trim vanities!
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	Well said, Lord Sands;
	Your colt's tooth is not cast yet.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	Sir Thomas,
	Whither were you a-going?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	O! 'tis true:
	This night he makes a supper, and a great one,
	To many lords and ladies; there will be
	The beauty of this kingdom, I'll assure you.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	No doubt he's noble;
	He had a black mouth that said other of him.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	True, they are so;
	But few now give so great ones. My barge stays;
	Your lordship shall along. Come, good Sir Thomas,
	We shall be late else; which I would not be,
	For I was spoke to, with Sir Henry Guildford,
	This night to be comptrollers.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 4><19%>
	You are young, Sir Harry Guildford.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 4><19%>
	Sweet ladies, will it please you sit? Sir Harry,
	Place you that side, I'll take the charge of this;
	His Grace is ent'ring. Nay you must not freeze;
	Two women plac'd together makes cold weather:
	My Lord Sands, you are one will keep 'em waking;
	Pray, sit between these ladies.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 4><20%>
	Well said, my lord.
	So, now you're fairly seated. Gentlemen,
	The penance lies on you, if these fair ladies
	Pass away frowning.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 4><21%>
	Look out there, some of ye.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 4><21%>
	How now, what is't?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 4><21%>
	Because they speak no English, thus they pray'd
	To tell your Grace: that, having heard by fame
	Of this so noble and so fair assembly
	This night to meet here, they could do no less,
	Out of the great respect they bear to beauty,
	But leave their flocks; and, under your fair conduct,
	Crave leave to view these ladies, and entreat
	An hour of revels with 'em.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 4><22%>
	Your Grace?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 4><22%>
	I will, my lord.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 4><22%>
	Such a one, they all confess,
	There is, indeed; which they would have your Grace
	Find out, and he will take it.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 4><23%>
	An't please your Grace, Sir Thomas Bullen's daughter,
	The Viscount Rochford, one of her highness' women.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	My lord, The horses your lordship sent for, with all the care I had, I saw well chosen, ridden, and furnished. They were young and handsome, and of the best breed in the north. When they were ready to set out for London, a man of my Lord Cardinal's, by commission and main power, took them from me; with this reason: His master would be served before a subject, if not before the king; which stopped our mouths, sir.
	I fear he will indeed. Well, let him have them:
	He will have all, I think.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	Good day to both your Graces.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	I left him private,
	Full of sad thoughts and troubles.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	It seems the marriage with his brother's wife
	Has crept too near his conscience.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	Heaven keep me from such counsel! 'Tis most true
	These news are every where; every tongue speaks 'em,
	And every true heart weeps for't. All that dare
	Look into these affairs, see this main end,
	The French king's sister. Heaven will one day open
	The king's eyes, that so long have slept upon
	This bold bad man.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	Excuse me;
	The king hath sent me otherwhere: besides,
	You'll find a most unfit time to disturb him:
	Health to your lordships.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	Good morrow, ladies. What were't worth to know
	The secret of your conference?
<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	It was a gentle business, and becoming
	The action of good women: there is hope
	All will be well.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	You bear a gentle mind, and heavenly blessings
	Follow such creatures. That you may, fair lady,
	Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note's
	Ta'en of your many virtues, the king's majesty
	Commends his good opinion of you, and
	Does purpose honour to you no less flowing
	Than Marchioness of Pembroke; to which title
	A thousand pound a year, annual support,
	Out of his grace he adds.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	Lady,
	I shall not fail to approve the fair conceit
	The king hath of you. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> I have perus'd her well;
	Beauty and honour in her are so mingled
	That they have caught the king; and who knows yet
	But from this lady may proceed a gem
	To lighten all this isle? <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> I'll to the king,
	And say, I spoke with you.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	My lords, you speak your pleasures:
	What he deserves of you and me, I know;
	What we can do to him,—though now the time
	Gives way to us,—I much fear. If you cannot
	Bar his access to the king, never attempt
	Any thing on him, for he hath a witchcraft
	Over the king in's tongue.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	The king in this perceives him, how he coasts
	And hedges his own way. But in this point
	All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic
	After his patient's death: the king already
	Hath married the fair lady.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	Now, God incense him,
	And let him cry Ha! louder.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 3><SCENE 2><64%>
	O my lord!
	Press not a falling man too far; 'tis virtue:
	His faults lie open to the laws; let them,
	Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him
	So little of his great self.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	'Tis now too certain:
	How much more is his life in value with him?
	Would I were fairly out on't.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 5><SCENE 4><96%>
	Mercy o' me, what a multitude are here!
	They grow still too, from all parts they are coming,
	As if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters,
	These lazy knaves? Ye have made a fine hand, fellows:
	There's a trim rabble let in. Are all these
	Your faithful friends o' the suburbs? We shall have
	Great store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies,
	When they pass back from the christening.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 5><SCENE 4><96%>
	As I live,
	If the king blame me for't, I'll lay ye all
	By the heels, and suddenly; and on your heads
	Clap round fines for neglect: ye're lazy knaves;
	And here ye lie baiting of bombards, when
	Ye should do service. Hark! the trumpets sound;
	They're come already from the christening.
	Go, break among the press, and find a way out
	To let the troop pass fairly, or I'll find
	A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.
