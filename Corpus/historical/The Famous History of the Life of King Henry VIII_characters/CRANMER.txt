	</STAGE DIR> It is my duty

<SPEECH 3><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	</STAGE DIR> I humbly thank your highness;
	And am right glad to catch this good occasion
	Most throughly to be winnow'd, where my chaff
	And corn shall fly asunder; for I know
	There's none stands under more calumnious tongues
	Than I myself, poor man.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	Most dread liege,
	The good I stand on is my truth and honesty:
	If they shall fail, I, with mine enemies,
	Will triumph o'er my person; which I weigh not,
	Being of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing
	What can be said against me.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	God and your majesty
	Protect mine innocence! or I fall into
	The trap is laid for me!
<SPEECH 6><ACT 5><SCENE 2><86%>
	I hope I am not too late; and yet the gentleman,
	That was sent to me from the council, pray'd me
	To make great haste. All fast? what means this? Ho!
	Who waits there?
	Sure, you know me?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 5><SCENE 2><86%>
	Why?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 5><SCENE 2><86%>
	So.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 2><86%>
	</STAGE DIR> 'Tis Butts,
	The king's physician. As he past along,
	How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me.
	Pray heaven he sound not my disgrace! For certain,
	This is of purpose laid by some that hate me,—
	God turn their hearts! I never sought their malice,—
	To quench mine honour: they would shame to make me
	Wait else at door, a fellow-counsellor,
	'Mong boys, grooms, and lackeys. But their pleasures
	Must be fulfill'd, and I attend with patience.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	My good lords, hitherto in all the progress
	Both of my life and office, I have labour'd,
	And with no little study, that my teaching
	And the strong course of my authority
	Might go one way, and safely; and the end
	Was ever, to do well: nor is there living,—
	I speak it with a single heart, my lords,—
	A man that more detests, more stirs against,
	Both in his private conscience and his place,
	Defacers of a public peace, than I do.
	Pray heaven the king may never find a heart
	With less allegiance in it! Men, that make
	Envy and crooked malice nourishment
	Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships
	That, in this case of justice, my accusers,
	Be what they will, may stand forth face to face,
	And freely urge against me.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	Ah! my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you;
	You are always my good friend: if your will pass,
	I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,
	You are so merciful. I see your end;
	'Tis my undoing: love and meekness, lord,
	Become a churchman better than ambition:
	Win straying souls with modesty again,
	Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,
	Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,
	I make as little doubt, as you do conscience,
	In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,
	But reverence to your calling makes me modest.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	Is there no other way of mercy,
	But I must needs to the Tower, my lords?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	For me?
	Must I go like a traitor thither?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	Stay, good my lords;
	I have a little yet to say. Look there, my lords;
	By virtue of that ring I take my cause
	Out of the gripes of cruel men, and give it
	To a most noble judge, the king my master.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
	The greatest monarch now alive may glory
	In such an honour: how may I deserve it,
	That am a poor and humble subject to you?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
	And let heaven
	Witness, how dear I hold this confirmation.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
	</STAGE DIR> And to your royal Grace, and the good queen,
	My noble partners, and myself, thus pray:
	All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady,
	Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy,
	May hourly fall upon ye!
<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
	Elizabeth.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
	Amen.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 5><98%>
	Let me speak, sir,
	For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter
	Let none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth.
	This royal infant,—heaven still move about her!—
	Though in her cradle, yet now promises
	Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,
	Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be—
	But few now living can behold that goodness—
	A pattern to all princes living with her,
	And all that shall succeed: Saba was never
	More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue
	Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,
	That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,
	With all the virtues that attend the good,
	Shall still be doubled on her; truth shall nurse her;
	Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her;
	She shall be lov'd and fear'd; her own shall bless her;
	Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,
	And hang their heads with sorrow; good grows with her.
	In her days every man shall eat in safety
	Under his own vine what he plants; and sing
	The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours.
	God shall be truly known; and those about her
	From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,
	And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.
	Nor shall this peace sleep with her; but as when
	The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phœnix,
	Her ashes new-create another heir
	As great in admiration as herself,
	So shall she leave her blessedness to one,—
	When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,—
	Who, from the sacred ashes of her honour,
	Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,
	And so stand fix'd. Peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,
	That were the servants to this chosen infant,
	Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:
	Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,
	His honour and the greatness of his name
	Shall be, and make new nations; he shall flourish,
	And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches
	To all the plains about him; our children's children
	Shall see this, and bless heaven.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 5><99%>
	She shall be, to the happiness of England,
	An aged princess; many days shall see her,
	And yet no day without a deed to crown it.
	Would I had known no more! but she must die,
	She must, the saints must have her, yet a virgin;
	A most unspotted lily shall she pass
	To the ground, and all the world shall mourn her.
