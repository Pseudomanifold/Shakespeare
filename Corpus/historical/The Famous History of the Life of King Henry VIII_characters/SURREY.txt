	I am joyful
	To meet the least occasion that may give me
	Remembrance of my father-in-law, the duke,
	To be reveng'd on him.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	Sir,
	I should be glad to hear such news as this
	Once every hour.

	How came
	His practices to light?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	O! how? how?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	Has the king this?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	Will this work?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	Would he had!
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	Now all my joy
	Trace the conjunction!
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	But will the king
	Digest this letter of the cardinal's?
	The Lord forbid!
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
	Sharp enough,
	Lord, for thy justice!
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
	I would 'twere something that would fret the string,
	The master-cord on's heart!
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	</STAGE DIR> The Lord increase this business!
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 2><61%>
	The king, that gave it.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 2><61%>
	Thou art a proud traitor, priest.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 2><61%>
	Thy ambition,
	Thou scarlet sin, robb'd this bewailing land
	Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law:
	The heads of all thy brother cardinals—
	With thee and all thy best parts bound together—
	Weigh'd not a hair of his. Plague of your policy!
	You sent me deputy for Ireland,
	Far from his succour, from the king, from all
	That might have mercy on the fault thou gav'st him;
	Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,
	Absolv'd him with an axe.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 2><62%>
	By my soul,
	Your long coat, priest, protects you; thou shouldst feel
	My sword i' the life-blood of thee else. My lords,
	Can ye endure to hear this arrogance?
	And from this fellow? If we live thus tamely,
	To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,
	Farewell nobility; let his Grace go forward,
	And dare us with his cap like larks.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 2><62%>
	Yes, that goodness
	Of gleaning all the land's wealth into one,
	Into your own hands, cardinal, by extortion;
	The goodness of your intercepted packets,
	You writ to the pope against the king; your goodness,
	Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious.
	My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,
	As you respect the common good, the state
	Of our despis'd nobility, our issues,
	Who, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen,
	Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles
	Collected from his life; I'll startle you
	Worse than the sacring bell, when the brown wench
	Lay kissing in your arms, Lord Cardinal.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 2><63%>
	This cannot save you:
	I thank my memory, I yet remember
	Some of these articles; and out they shall.
	Now, if you can blush, and cry 'guilty,' cardinal,
	You'll show a little honesty.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 2><63%>
	I had rather want those than my head. Have at you!
	First, that, without the king's assent or know ledge,
	You wrought to be a legate; by which power
	You maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 2><63%>
	Item, you sent a large commission
	To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,
	Without the king's will or the state's allowance,
	A league between his highness and Ferrara.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 2><63%>
	Then, that you have sent innumerable substance,—
	By what means got I leave to your own conscience,—
	To furnish Rome, and to prepare the ways
	You have for dignities; to the mere undoing
	Of all the kingdom. Many more there are;
	Which, since they are of you, and odious,
	I will not taint my mouth with.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 2><64%>
	I forgive him.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	'Tis no counterfeit.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
	May it please your Grace,—
