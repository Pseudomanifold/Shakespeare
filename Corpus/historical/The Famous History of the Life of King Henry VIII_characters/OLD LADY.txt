	Hearts of most hard temper
	Melt and lament for her.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	Alas! poor lady,
	She's a stranger now again.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	Our content
	Is our best having.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	Beshrew me, I would,
	And venture maidenhead for't; and so would you,
	For all this spice of your hypocrisy.
	You, that have so fair parts of woman on you,
	Have too a woman's heart; which ever yet
	Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty:
	Which, to say sooth, are blessings, and which gifts—
	Saving your mincing—the capacity
	Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive,
	If you might please to stretch it.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	Yes, troth, and troth; you would not be a queen?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	'Tis strange: a three-pence bow'd would hire me,
	Old as I am, to queen it. But, I pray you,
	What think you of a duchess? have you limbs
	To bear that load of title?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	Then you are weakly made. Pluck off a little:
	I would not be a young count in your way,
	For more than blushing comes to: if your back
	Cannot vouchsafe this burden, 'tis too weak
	Ever to get a boy.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	In faith, for little England
	You'd venture an emballing: I myself
	Would for Carnarvonshire, although there 'long'd
	No more to the crown but that. Lo! who comes here?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	Why, this it is; see, see!
	I have been begging sixteen years in court,
	Am yet a courtier beggarly, nor could
	Come pat betwixt too early and too late;
	For any suit of pounds; and you, O fate!
	A very fresh-fish here,—fie, fie, upon
	This compell'd fortune!—have your mouth fill'd up
	Before you open it.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	How tastes it? is it bitter? forty pence, no.
	There was a lady once,—'tis an old story,—
	That would not be a queen, that would she not,
	For all the mud in Egypt: have you heard it?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	With your theme I could
	O'ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke!
	A thousand pounds a year, for pure respect!
	No other obligation! By my life
	That promises more thousands: honour's train
	Is longer than his foreskirt. By this time
	I know your back will bear a duchess: say,
	Are you not stronger than you were?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	What do you think me?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	I'll not come back; the tidings that I bring
	Will make my boldness manners. Now, good angels
	Fly o'er thy royal head, and shade thy person
	Under their blessed wings!
<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	Ay, ay, my liege;
	And of a lovely boy: the God of heaven
	Both now and ever bless her! 'tis a girl,
	Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen
	Desires your visitation, and to be
	Acquainted with this stranger: 'tis as like you
	As cherry is to cherry.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	A hundred marks! By this light, I'll ha' more.
	An ordinary groom is for such payment:
	I will have more, or scold it out of him.
	Said I for this the girl was like to him?
	I will have more, or else unsay't; and now,
	While it is hot, I'll put it to the issue.
