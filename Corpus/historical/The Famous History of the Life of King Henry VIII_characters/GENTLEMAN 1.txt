<SPEECH 1><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Whither away so fast?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	I'll save you
	That labour, sir. All's now done but the ceremony
	Of bringing back the prisoner.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Yes, indeed, was I.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	You may guess quickly what.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	So are a number more.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	I'll tell you in a little. The great duke
	Came to the bar; where, to his accusations
	He pleaded still not guilty, and alleg'd
	Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.
	The king's attorney on the contrary
	Urg'd on the examinations, proofs, confessions
	Of divers witnesses, which the duke desir'd
	To have brought, viv√¢ voce, to his face:
	At which appear'd against him his surveyor;
	Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,
	Confessor to him; with that devil-monk,
	Hopkins, that made this mischief.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	The same.
	All these accus'd him strongly; which he fain
	Would have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:
	And so his peers, upon this evidence,
	Have found him guilty of high treason. Much
	He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all
	Was either pitied in him or forgotten.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	When he was brought again to the bar, to hear
	His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'd
	With such an agony, he sweat extremely,
	And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:
	But he fell to himself again, and sweetly
	In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	Sure, he does not;
	He never was so womanish; the cause
	He may a little grieve at.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	'Tis likely
	By all conjectures: first, Kildare's attainder,
	Then deputy of Ireland; who, remov'd,
	Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,
	Lest he should help his father.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	At his return,
	No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,
	And generally, whoever the king favours,
	The cardinal instantly will find employment,
	And far enough from court too.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	Stay there, sir,
	And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
	O! this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,
	I fear, too many curses on their heads
	That were the authors.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
	Good angels keep it from us!
	What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
	Let me have it;
	I do not talk much.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
	Yes, but it held not;
	For when the king once heard it, out of anger
	He sent command to the lord mayor straight
	To stop the rumour, and allay those tongues
	That durst disperse it.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
	'Tis the cardinal;
	And merely to revenge him on the emperor
	For not bestowing on him, at his asking,
	The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purpos'd.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
	'Tis woeful.
	We are too open here to argue this;
	Let's think in private more.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
	You're well met once again.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
	You come to take your stand here, and behold
	The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
	'Tis very true: but that time offer'd sorrow;
	This, general joy.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
	Never greater;
	Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
	Yes; 'tis the list
	Of those that claim their offices this day
	By custom of the coronation.
	The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims
	To be high-steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,
	He to be earl marshal: you may read the rest.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
	That I can tell you too. The Archbishop
	Of Canterbury, accompanied with other
	Learned and reverend fathers of his order,
	Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles off
	From Ampthill, where the princess lay; to which
	She was often cited by them, but appear'd not:
	And, to be short, for not appearance and
	The king's late scruple, by the main assent
	Of all these learned men she was divorc'd,
	And the late marriage made of none effect:
	Since which she was remov'd to Kimbolton,
	Where she remains now sick.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	Marquess Dorset:
	And that the Earl of Surrey with the rod.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	'Tis the same; high-steward.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	Yes.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	They that bear
	The cloth of honour over her, are four barons
	Of the Cinque-ports.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	It is; and all the rest are countesses.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	No more of that.
	God save you, sir! Where have you been broiling?
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	How was it?
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	Sir,
	You must no more call it York-place, that's past;
	For, since the cardinal fell, that title's lost:
	'Tis now the king's, and call'd Whitehall.
