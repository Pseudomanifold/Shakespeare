	Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
	Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
	And then the moon, like to a silver bow

	I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,
	When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
	With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear

	I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!

	Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a good grace.

	Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.
