	Here, mighty Theseus.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	There is a brief how many sports are ripe;
	Make choice of which your highness will see first.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,
	Which is as brief as I have known a play;
	But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,
	Which makes it tedious; for in all the play
	There is not one word apt, one player fitted.
	And tragical, my noble lord, it is;
	For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
	Which when I saw rehears'd, I must confess,
	Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
	The passion of loud laughter never shed.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	Hard-handed men, that work in Athens here,
	Which never labour'd in their minds till now,
	And now have toil'd their unbreath'd memories
	With this same play, against your nuptial.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	No, my noble lord;
	It is not for you: I have heard it over,
	And it is nothing, nothing in the world;
	Unless you can find sport in their intents,
	Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
	To do you service.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	So please your Grace, the Prologue is address'd.
