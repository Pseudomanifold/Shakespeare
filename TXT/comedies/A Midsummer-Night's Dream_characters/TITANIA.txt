	What! jealous Oberon. Fairies, skip hence:
	I have forsworn his bed and company.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
	Then, I must be thy lady; but I know
	When thou hast stol'n away from fairy land,
	And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
	Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love
	To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,
	Come from the furthest steppe of India?
	But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
	Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
	To Theseus must be wedded, and you come
	To give their bed joy and prosperity.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
	These are the forgeries of jealousy:
	And never, since the middle summer's spring,
	Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,
	By paved fountain, or by rushy brook,
	Or in the beached margent of the sea,
	To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
	But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.
	Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
	As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea
	Contagious fogs; which, falling in the land,
	Have every pelting river made so proud
	That they have overborne their continents:
	The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
	The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
	Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard:
	The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
	And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
	The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
	And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
	For lack of tread are undistinguishable:
	The human mortals want their winter here:
	No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
	Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
	Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
	That rheumatic diseases do abound:
	And thorough this distemperature we see
	The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
	Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
	And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
	An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
	Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,
	The childing autumn, angry winter, change
	Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,
	By their increase, now knows not which is which.
	And this same progeny of evil comes
	From our debate, from our dissension:
	We are their parents and original.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	Set your heart at rest;
	The fairy land buys not the child of me.
	His mother was a votaress of my order:
	And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,
	Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,
	And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
	Marking the embarked traders on the flood;
	When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
	And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
	Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait
	Following,—her womb then rich with my young squire,—
	Would imitate, and sail upon the land,
	To fetch me trifles, and return again,
	As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.
	But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;
	And for her sake I do rear up her boy,
	And for her sake I will not part with him.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Perchance, till after Theseus' weddingday.
	If you will patiently dance in our round,
	And see our moonlight revels, go with us;
	If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!
	We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
	Then, for the third of a minute, hence;
	Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
	Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
	To make my small elves coats, and some keep back
	The clamorous owl, that nightly hoots, and wonders
	At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
	Then to your offices, and let me rest.
	The Fairies sing.
	I.
	You spotted snakes with double tongue,
	Thorny hedge-hogs, be not seen;
	Newts, and blind-worms, do no wrong;
	Come not near our fairy queen.
	Philomel, with melody,
	Sing in our sweet lullaby:
	Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby:
	Never harm,
	Nor spell, nor charm,
	Come our lovely lady nigh;
	So, good night, with lullaby.
	II.
	Weaving spiders come not here;
	Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!
	Beetles black, approach not near;
	Worm nor snail, do no offence.
	Philomel, with melody, &c.

	</STAGE DIR> What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:
	Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
	So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
	And thy fair virtue's force, perforce, doth move me,
	On the first view, to say, to swear, I love thee.

	Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.

	Out of this wood do not desire to go:
	Thou shalt remain here, whe'r thou wilt or no.
	I am a spirit of no common rate;
	The summer still doth tend upon my state;
	And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;
	I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,
	And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
	And sing, while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep:
	And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
	That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
	Pease-blossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!

	Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;
	Hop in his walks, and gambol in his eyes;
	Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,
	With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries.
	The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,
	And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs,
	And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,
	To have my love to bed, and to arise;
	And pluck the wings from painted butterflies
	To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:
	Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.
	The moon methinks, looks with a watery eye;
	And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,
	Lamenting some enforced chastity.
	Tie up my love's tongue, bring him silently.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
	Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,
	While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,
	And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,
	And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.

	What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?

	So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
	Gently entwist; the female ivy so

	O! how I love thee; how I dote on thee!

	First, rehearse your song by rote,
	To each word a warbling note:
	Hand in hand, with fairy grace,
	Will we sing, and bless this place.
