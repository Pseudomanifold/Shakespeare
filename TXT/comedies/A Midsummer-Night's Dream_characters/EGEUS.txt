	Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Full of vexation come I, with complaint
	Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
	Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
	This man hath my consent to marry her.
	Stand forth, Lysander: and, my gracious duke,
	This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child:
	Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rimes,
	And interchang'd love-tokens with my child;
	Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
	With feigning voice, verses of feigning love;
	And stol'n the impression of her fantasy
	With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
	Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
	Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth;
	With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart;
	Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
	To stubborn harshness. And, my gracious duke,
	Be it so she will not here before your Grace
	Consent to marry with Demetrius,
	I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
	As she is mine, I may dispose of her;
	Which shall be either to this gentleman,
	Or to her death, according to our law
	Immediately provided in that case.

	Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,
	And what is mine my love shall render him;
	And she is mine, and all my right of her
	I do estate unto Demetrius.

	With duty and desire we follow you.

	My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;
	And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;
	This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:
	I wonder of their being here together.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 1><74%>
	It is, my lord.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 1><75%>
	Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
	I beg the law, the law, upon his head.
	They would have stol'n away; they would, Demetrius,
	Thereby to have defeated you and me;
	You of your wife, and me of my consent,
	Of my consent that she should be your wife.
