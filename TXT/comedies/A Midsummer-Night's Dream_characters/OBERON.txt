	Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
	Tarry, rash wanton! am not I thy lord?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
	How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,
	Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
	Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
	Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
	From Perigouna, whom he ravished?
	And make him with fair Ã†gle break his faith,
	With Ariadne, and Antiopa?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	Do you amend it then; it lies in you.
	Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
	I do but beg a little changeling boy,
	To be my henchman.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	How long within this wood intend you stay?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove
	Till I torment thee for this injury.
	My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou remember'st
	Since once I sat upon a promontory,
	And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
	Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath,
	That the rude sea grew civil at her song,
	And certain stars shot madly from their spheres
	To hear the sea-maid's music.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,
	Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
	Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
	At a fair vestal throned by the west,
	And loos'd his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
	As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
	But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
	Quench'd in the chaste beams of the wat'ry moon,
	And the imperial votaress passed on,
	In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
	Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
	It fell upon a little western flower,
	Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
	And maidens call it, Love-in-idleness.
	Fetch me that flower; the herb I show'd thee once:
	The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid
	Will make or man or woman madly dote
	Upon the next live creature that it sees.
	Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again
	Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	Having once this juice
	I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,
	And drop the liquor of it in her eyes:
	The next thing then she waking looks upon,
	Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
	On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,
	She shall pursue it with the soul of love:
	And ere I take this charm off from her sight,
	As I can take it with another herb,
	I'll make her render up her page to me.
	But who comes here? I am invisible,
	And I will overhear their conference.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
	Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,
	Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.
	Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
	I pray thee, give it me.
	I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows,
	Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows
	Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
	With sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine:
	There sleeps Titania some time of the night,
	Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;
	And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,
	Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:
	And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,
	And make her full of hateful fantasies.
	Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
	A sweet Athenian lady is in love
	With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
	But do it when the next thing he espies
	May be the lady. Thou shalt know the man
	By the Athenian garments he hath on.
	Effect it with some care, that he may prove
	More fond on her than she upon her love.
	And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	What thou seest when thou dost wake,
	Do it for thy true-love take;
	Love and languish for his sake:
	Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
	Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
	In thy eye that shall appear
	When thou wak'st, it is thy dear.
	Wake when some vile thing is near.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
	I wonder if Titania be awak'd;
	Then, what it was that next came in her eye,
	Which she must dote on in extremity.
	Here comes my messenger.
	How now, mad spirit!
	What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	This falls out better than I could devise.
	But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
	With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	Stand close: this is the same Athenian.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite,
	And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:
	Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
	Some true-love turn'd, and not a false turn'd true.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	About the wood go swifter than the wind,
	And Helena of Athens look thou find:
	All fancy-sick she is, and pale of cheer
	With sighs of love, that cost the fresh blood dear.
	By some illusion see thou bring her here:
	I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	Flower of this purple dye,
	Hit with Cupid's archery,
	Sink in apple of his eye.
	When his love he doth espy,
	Let her shine as gloriously
	As the Venus of the sky.
	When thou wak'st, if she be by,
	Beg of her for remedy.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	Stand aside: the noise they make
	Will cause Demetrius to awake.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 2><62%>
	This is thy negligence: still thou mistak'st,
	Or else commit'st thy knaveries wilfully.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 2><62%>
	Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:
	Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
	The starry welking cover thou anon
	With drooping fog as black as Acheron;
	And lead these testy rivals so astray,
	As one come not within another's way.
	Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,
	Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;
	And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;
	And from each other look thou lead them thus,
	Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
	With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:
	Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;
	Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,
	To take from thence all error with his might,
	And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
	When they next wake, all this derision
	Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision;
	And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,
	With league whose date till death shall never end.
	Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
	I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;
	And then I will her charmed eye release
	From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 2><64%>
	But we are spirits of another sort.
	I with the morning's love have oft made sport;
	And, like a forester, the groves may tread,
	Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,
	Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
	Turns into yellow gold his salt green-streams.
	But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay:
	We may effect this business yet ere day.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	</STAGE DIR> Welcome, good Robin. See'st thou this sweet sight?
	Her dotage now I do begin to pity:
	For, meeting her of late behind the wood,
	Seeking sweet favours for this hateful fool,
	I did upbraid her and fall out with her;
	For she his hairy temples then had rounded
	With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
	And that same dew, which sometime on the buds
	Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,
	Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes
	Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
	When I had at my pleasure taunted her,
	And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,
	I then did ask of her her changeling child;
	Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent
	To bear him to my bower in fairy land.
	And now I have the boy, I will undo
	This hateful imperfection of her eyes:
	And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp
	From off the head of this Athenian swain,
	That he, awaking when the other do,
	May all to Athens back again repair,
	And think no more of this night's accidents
	But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
	But first I will release the fairy queen.
	Be as thou wast wont to be;
	See as thou wast wont to see:
	Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
	Hath such force and blessed power.
	Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	There lies your love.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	Silence, awhile. Robin, take off this head.
	Titania, music call; and strike more dead
	Than common sleep of all these five the sense.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	Sound, music! <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Come, my queen, take hands with me,
	And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
	Now thou and I are new in amity,
	And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
	Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,
	And bless it to all fair prosperity.
	There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
	Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	Then, my queen, in silence sad,
	Trip we after the night's shade;
	We the globe can compass soon,
	Swifter than the wandering moon.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
	Through the house give glimmering light
	By the dead and drowsy fire;
	Every elf and fairy sprite
	Hop as light as bird from brier;
	And this ditty after me
	Sing and dance it trippingly.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 2><99%>
	Now, until the break of day,
	Through this house each fairy stray.
	To the best bride-bed will we,
	Which by us shall blessed be;
	And the issue there create
	Ever shall be fortunate.
	So shall all the couples three
	Ever true in loving be;
	And the blots of Nature's hand
	Shall not in their issue stand:
	Never mole, hare-lip, nor scar,
	Nor mark prodigious, such as are
	Despised in nativity,
	Shall upon their children be.
	With this field-dew consecrate,
	Every fairy take his gait,
	And each several chamber bless,
	Through this palace, with sweet peace;
	Ever shall in safety rest,
	And the owner of it blest.
	Trip away;
	Make no stay;
	Meet me all by break of day.
