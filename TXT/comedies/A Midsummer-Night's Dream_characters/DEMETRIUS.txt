	Relent, sweet Hermia; and, Lysander, yield
	Thy crazed title to my certain right.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
	Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
	The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.
	Thou told'st me they were stol'n into this wood;
	And here am I, and wood within this wood,
	Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
	Hence! get thee gone, and follow me no more.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair?
	Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
	Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit,
	For I am sick when I do look on you.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	You do impeach your modesty too much,
	To leave the city, and commit yourself
	Into the hands of one that loves you not;
	To trust the opportunity of night
	And the ill counsel of a desert place
	With the rich worth of your virginity.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,
	And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	I will not stay thy questions: let me go;
	Or, if thou follow me, do not believe
	But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
	I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
	Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	O! why rebuke you him that loves you so?
	Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	So should the murder'd look, and so should I,
	Pierc'd through the heart with your stern cruelty;
	Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,
	As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	You spend your passion on a mispris'd mood:
	I am not guilty of Lysander's blood,
	Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	An if I could, what should I get therefore?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	There is no following her in this fierce vein:
	Here therefore for awhile I will remain.
	So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
	For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe;
	Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
	If for his tender here I make some stay.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
	</STAGE DIR> O Helen! goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!
	To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
	Crystal is muddy. O! how ripe in show
	Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow,
	This pure congealed white, high Taurus' snow,
	Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow
	When thou hold'st up thy hand. O! let me kiss
	That princess of pure white, this seal of bliss.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:
	If e'er I lov'd her, all that love is gone.
	My heart with her but as guest wise sojourn'd,
	And now to Helen it is home return'd,
	There to remain.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
	Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear.
	Look! where thy love comes: yonder is thy dear.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	If she cannot entreat, I can compel.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	I say I love thee more than he can do.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	Quick, come!
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	No, no, he'll . . .
	Seem to break loose; take on, as you would follow,
	But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	I would I had your bond, for I perceive
	A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 2><61%>
	No, sir; she shall not, though you take her part.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 2><61%>
	You are too officious
	In her behalf that scorns your services.
	Let her alone; speak not of Helena;
	Take not her part, for, if thou dost intend
	Never so little show of love to her,
	Thou shalt aby it.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 2><62%>
	Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 2><65%>
	Lysander! speak again.
	Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
	Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 2><65%>
	Yea, art thou there?
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 2><66%>
	Abide me, if thou dar'st; for well I wot
	Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place,
	And dar'st not stand, nor look me in the face.
	Where art thou now?
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 2><66%>
	Nay then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,
	If ever I thy face by daylight see:
	Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me
	To measure out my length on this cold bed:
	By day's approach look to be visited.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 1><76%>
	My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
	Of this their purpose hither, to this wood;
	And I in fury hither follow'd them,
	Fair Helena in fancy following me.
	But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,—
	But by some power it is,—my love to Hermia,
	Melted as doth the snow, seems to me now
	As the remembrance of an idle gaud
	Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
	And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
	The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
	Is only Helena. To her, my lord,
	Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
	But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;
	But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
	Now do I wish it, love it, long for it,
	And will for evermore be true to it.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 1><77%>
	These things seem small and undistinguishable,
	Like far-off mountains turned into clouds.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 1><77%>
	Are you sure
	That we are awake? It seems to me
	That yet we sleep, we dream. Do you not think
	The duke was here, and bid us follow him?
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 1><77%>
	Why then, we are awake. Let's follow him;
	And by the way let us recount our dreams.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.
	Wall. In this same interlude it doth befall
	That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;
	And such a wall, as I would have you think,
	That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
	Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
	Did whisper often very secretly.
	This loam, this rough-cast, and this stone doth show
	That I am that same wall; the truth is so;
	And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
	Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse, my lord.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear without warning.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his discretion, and the fox carries the goose.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	He should have worn the horns on his head.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	He dares not come there for the candle; for, you see, it is already in snuff.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	Well roared, Lion.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
	And then came Pyramus.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 1><95%>
	No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
	A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which Thisbe, is the better: he for a man, God warrant us; she for a woman, God bless us.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
	And thus she moans, videlicet:—
<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
	Ay, and Wall too.
