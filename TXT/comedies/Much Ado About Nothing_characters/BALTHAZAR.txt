	Well, I would you did like me.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><19%>
	Which is one?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><19%>
	I love you the better; the hearers may cry Amen.

	O! good my lord, tax not so bad a voice

	Because you talk of wooing, I will sing;
	Since many a wooer doth commence his suit
	To her he thinks not worthy; yet he woos;
	Yet will he swear he loves.

	Note this before my notes;
	There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
	And an ill singer, my lord.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	The best I can, my lord.
