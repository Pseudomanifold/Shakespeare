	Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	What! my dear Lady Disdain, are you yet living?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart; for, truly, I love none.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	God keep your ladyship still in that mind; so some gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate scratched face.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's name; I have done.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	I noted her not; but I looked on her.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise: only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad brow, or do you play the flouting Jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder, and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take you, to go in the song?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter: there's her cousin an she were not possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December. But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	Is't come to this, i' faith? Hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again? Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it, and sigh away Sundays. Look! Don Pedro is returned to seek you.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	I would your Grace would constrain me to tell.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb man; I would have you think so; but on my allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance: he is in love. With who? now that is your Grace's part. Mark how short his answer is: with Hero, Leonato's short daughter.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor 'twas not so; but, indeed, God forbid it should be so.'

	And by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	That I neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she brought me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust none; and the fine is,—for the which I may go the finer,—I will live a bachelor.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord; not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen, and hang me up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of blind Cupid.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on the shoulder, and called Adam.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set them in my forehead; and let me be vilely painted, and in such great letters as they write, 'Here is good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign 'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'
<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	I look for an earthquake too then.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage; and so I commit you—
<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere you flout old ends any further, examine your conscience: and so I leave you.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
	No, you shall pardon me.

	Even to the next willow, about your own business, count. What fashion will you wear the garland of? About your neck, like a usurer's chain? or under your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so they sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would have served you thus?
<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	Ho! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas the boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	Alas! poor hurt fowl. Now will he creep into sedges. But, that my lady Beatrice should know me, and not know me! The prince's fool! Ha! it may be I go under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it is the base though bitter disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person, and so gives me out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame. I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren. I told him, and I think I told him true, that your Grace had got the good will of this young lady; and I offered him my company to a willow tree, either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	The flat transgression of a school-boy, who, being overjoy'd with finding a bird's nest, shows it his companion, and he steals it.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made, and the garland too; for the garland he might have worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on you, who, as I take it, have stolen his bird's nest.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	If their singing answer your saying, by my faith, you say honestly.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	O! she misused me past the endurance of a block: an oak but with one green leaf on it, would have answered her: my very visor began to assume life and scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been myself, that I was the prince's jester; that I was duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me, that I stood like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs: if her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her; she would infect to the north star. I would not marry her, though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire too. Come, talk not of her; you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror and perturbation follow her.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	Will your Grace command me any service to the world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on; I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of Asia; bring you the length of Prester John's foot; fetch you a hair off the Great Cham's beard; do you any embassage to the Pigmies, rather than hold three words' conference with this harpy. You have no employment for me?
<SPEECH 46><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	O God, sir, here's a dish I love not: I cannot endure my Lady Tongue.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
	Boy!
<SPEECH 48><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
	In my chamber-window lies a book; bring it hither to me in the orchard.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
	I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again. [Exit Boy.] I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love, will, after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others, become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love: and such a man is Claudio. I have known, when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe: I have known, when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake, carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man and a soldier; and now is he turned orthographer; his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes. May I be so converted, and see with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster; but I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise, or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her; fair, or I'll never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
	Now, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out of men's bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when all's done.
	<BALTHAZAR SINGS.>Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,
	Men were deceivers ever;
	One foot in sea, and one on shore,

<SPEECH 54><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
	</STAGE DIR> This can be no trick: the conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it seems, her affections have their full bent. Love me! why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured: they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive the love come from her; they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy are they that hear their detractions, and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair: 'tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous: 'tis so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me: by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, because I have railed so long against marriage; but doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour? No; the world must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day! she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in her.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
	Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
	You take pleasure then in the message?
<SPEECH 57><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
	Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner,' there's a double meaning in that. 'I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me,' that's as much as to say, Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>

	Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:
	And though you know my inwardness and love

<SPEECH 98><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	</STAGE DIR> You are a villain; I jest not: I will make it good how you dare, with what you dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me hear from you.
<SPEECH 99><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.
<SPEECH 100><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave you now to your gossip-like humour: you break jests as braggarts do their blades, which, God be thanked, hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank you: I must discontinue your company. Your brother the bastard is fled from Messina: you have, among you, killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord Lack-beard there, he and I shall meet; and till then, peace be with him.
<SPEECH 101><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.
<SPEECH 102><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>

	Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches.
<SPEECH 104><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>

	If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.

	And therefore will come.
	The god of love,
	That sits above,
	And knows me, and knows me,
	How pitiful I deserve,—
	I mean, in singing; but in loving, Leander the good swimmer, Troilus the first employer of pandars, and a whole book full of these quondam carpet-mongers, whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self, in love. Marry, I cannot show it in rime; I have tried: I can find out no rime to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent rime; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rime; for 'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rime; very ominous endings: no, I was not born under a riming planet, nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
	Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?
<SPEECH 107><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	O, stay but till then!
<SPEECH 108><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.
<SPEECH 109><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge, and either I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me, for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?
<SPEECH 110><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	'Suffer love,' a good epithet! I do suffer love indeed, for I love thee against my will.
<SPEECH 111><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.
<SPEECH 112><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in the time of good neighbours. If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps.

	Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum: therefore it is most expedient for the wise,—if Don Worm, his conscience, find no impediment to the contrary,—to be the trumpet of his own virtues, as I am to myself.

<SPEECH 114><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	And how do you?
