	</STAGE DIR> Too hot, too hot!
	To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
	I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;
	But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment
	May a free face put on, derive a liberty
	From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,
	And well become the agent:'t may I grant:
	But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,
	As now they are, and making practis'd smiles,
	As in a looking-glass; and then to sigh, as 'twere
	The mort o' the deer; O! that is entertainment
	My bosom likes not, nor my brows. Mamillius,
	Art thou my boy?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 2><6%>
	I' fecks?
	Why, that's my bawcock. What! hast smutch'd thy nose?
	They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
	We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:
	And yet the steer, the heifer, and the calf,
	Are all call'd neat. Still virginalling
	Upon his palm! How now, you wanton calf!
	Art thou my calf?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 2><6%>
	Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,
	To be full like me: yet they say we are
	Almost as like as eggs; women say so,
	That will say anything: but were they false
	As o'er-dy'd blacks, as wind, as waters, false
	As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
	No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true
	To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
	Look on me with your wolkin eye: sweet villain!
	Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?—may't be?—
	Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
	Thou dost make possible things not so held,
	Communicat'st with dreams;—how can this be?—
	With what's unreal thou co-active art,
	And fellow'st nothing: then, 'tis very credent
	Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,

	And hardening of my brows.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	No, in good earnest.
	How sometimes nature will betray its folly,
	Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
	To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
	Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
	Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
	In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
	Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
	As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:
	How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,
	This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,
	Will you take eggs for money?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>

	To her allowing husband!
	Gone already!
	Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and ears a fork'd one!
	Go play, boy, play; thy mother plays, and I
	Play too, but so disgrac'd a part, whose issue
	Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour
	Will be my knell. Go play, boy, play. There have been,
	Or I am much deceiv'd, cuckolds ere now;
	And many a man there is even at this present,
	Now, while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
	That little thinks she has been sluic'd in's absence,
	And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by
	Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't,
	Whiles other men have gates, and those gates open'd,
	As mine, against their will. Should all despair
	That have revolted wives the tenth of mankind
	Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;
	It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
	Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,
	From east, west, north, and south: be it concluded,
	No barricado for a belly: know't;
	It will let in and out the enemy
	With bag and baggage. Many a thousand on's

	Why, that's some comfort.
	What! Camillo there?

<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	At the queen's, be't: 'good' should be pertinent;

	With all the nearest things to my heart, as well
	My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
	Hast cleans'd my bosom: I from thee departed
	Thy penitent reform'd; but we have been
	Deceiv'd in thy integrity, deceiv'd
	In that which seems so.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	To bide upon 't, thou art not honest; or,
	If thou inclin'st that way, thou art a coward,
	Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
	From course requir'd; or else thou must be counted
	A servant grafted in my serious trust,
	And therein negligent; or else a fool
	That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
	And tak'st it all for jest.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	Ha' not you seen, Camillo,—
	But that's past doubt; you have, or your eyeglass
	Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,—or heard,—
	For to a vision so apparent rumour
	Cannot be mute,—or thought,—for cogitation
	Resides not in that man that does not think,—
	My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,—
	Or else be impudently negative,
	To have nor eyes, nor ears, nor thought,—then say
	My wife's a hobby-horse; deserves a name
	As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
	Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	Is whispering nothing?
	Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
	Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
	Of laughter with a sigh?—a note infallible
	Of breaking honesty,—horsing foot on foot?
	Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
	Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes
	Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
	That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?
	Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;
	The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;
	My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,
	If this be nothing.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	Say it be, 'tis true.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	It is; you lie, you lie:

	Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,

	Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver
	Infected as her life, she would not live
	The running of one glass.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	Why, he that wears her like her medal, hanging

	Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,
	His cup-bearer,—whom I from meaner form
	Have bench'd and rear'd to worship, who mayst see
	Plainly, as heaven sees earth, and earth sees heaven,
	How I am galled,—mightst bespice a cup,
	To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
	Which draught to me were cordial.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
	Make that thy question, and go rot!

	Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps?
	Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,

	How blest am I

	And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
	Is not infected; but if one present
	The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known
	How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
	With violent hefts. I have drunk, and seen the spider.
	Camillo was his help in this, his pandar:
	There is a plot against my life, my crown;
	All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain
	Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:
	He has discover'd my design, and I
	Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
	For them to play at will. How came the posterns
	So easily open?

	I know't too well.
	</STAGE DIR> Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:

	You, my lords,
	Look on her, mark her well; be but about

	The justice of your hearts will thereto add
	''Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'
	Praise her but for this her without-door form,—
	Which, on my faith deserves high speech,—and straight
	The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
	That calumny doth use,—O, I am out!—
	That mercy does, for calumny will sear
	Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,
	When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between,
	Ere you can say 'she's honest.' But be't known,
	From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
	She's an adulteress.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
	You have mistook, my lady,

	Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,
	Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,
	Should a like language use to all degrees,
	And mannerly distinguishment leave out
	Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said
	She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:
	More, she's a traitor, and Camillo is
	A federary with her, and one that knows
	What she should shame to know herself
	But with her most vile principal, that she's
	A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
	That vulgars give bold'st titles; ay, and privy

<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
	No; if I mistake
	In those foundations which I build upon,

	But that he speaks.

	What! lack I credit?
<SPEECH 48><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Why, what need we

	Or seeming so in skill,—cannot or will not
	Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
	We need no more of your advice: the matter,
	The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all
	Properly ours.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	How could that be?
	Either thou art most ignorant by age,
	Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
	Added to their familiarity,
	Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
	That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation
	But only seeing, all other circumstances
	Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:
	Yet, for a greater confirmation,—
	For in an act of this importance 'twere
	Most piteous to be wild,—I have dispatch'd in post
	To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,
	Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
	Of stuff'd sufficiency. Now, from the oracle
	They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,
	Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?
<SPEECH 50><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Though I am satisfied and need no more
	Than what I know, yet shall the oracle
	Give rest to the minds of others, such as he
	Whose ignorant credulity will not
	Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good
	From our free person she should be confin'd,
	Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
	Be left her to perform. Come, follow us:
	We are to speak in public; for this business
	Will raise us all.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 2><SCENE 3><26%>
	Nor night, nor day, no rest; it is but weakness

	Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
	And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she
	I can hook to me: say, that she were gone,

	Your actions are my dreams:
	You had a bastard by Polixenes,
	And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,—
	Those of your fact are so,—so past all truth:
	Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
	Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
	No father owning it,—which is, indeed,
	More criminal in thee than it,—so thou
	Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage
	Look for no less than death.

	Take her hence:
	Her heart is but o'ercharg'd; she will recover:
	I have too much believ'd mine own suspicion:
	Beseech you, tenderly apply to her
	Some remedies for life.—
	Apollo, pardon
	My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!
	I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,
	New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,
	Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;
	For, being transported by my jealousies
	To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose
	Camillo for the minister to poison
	My friend Polixenes: which had been done,
	But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
	My swift command; though I with death and with
	Reward did threaten and encourage him,
	Not doing it, and being done: he, most humane
	And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest
	Unclasp'd my practice, quit his fortunes here,
	Which you knew great, and to the certain hazard
	Of all incertainties himself commended,
	No richer than his honour: how he glisters
	Thorough my rust! and how his piety
	Does my deeds make the blacker!
<SPEECH 88><ACT 3><SCENE 2><41%>
	Go on, go on;
	Thou canst not speak too much: I have deserv'd
	All tongues to talk their bitterest.
<SPEECH 89><ACT 3><SCENE 2><41%>
	Thou didst speak but well,
	When most the truth, which I receive much better
	Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me
	To the dead bodies of my queen and son:
	One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
	The causes of their death appear, unto
	Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit
	The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there
	Shall be my recreation: so long as nature
	Will bear up with this exercise, so long
	I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me
	Unto these sorrows.
<SPEECH 90><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
	Whilst I remember
	Her and her virtues, I cannot forget
	My blemishes in them, and so still think of
	The wrong I did myself; which was so much,
	That heirless it hath made my kingdom, and
	Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
	Bred his hopes out of.
<SPEECH 91><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	I think so. Kill'd!
	She I kill'd! I did so; but thou strik'st me
	Sorely to say I did: it is as bitter
	Upon thy tongue as in my thought. Now, good now
	Say so but seldom.
<SPEECH 92><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	Good Paulina,
	Who hast the memory of Hermione,
	I know, in honour; O! that ever I
	Had squar'd me to thy counsel! then, even now,
	I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
	Have taken treasure from her lips,—
<SPEECH 93><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	Thou speak'st truth.
	No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
	And better us'd, would make her sainted spirit
	Again possess her corpse and on this stage,—
	Where we're offenders now,—appear soul-vex'd,
	And begin, 'Why to me?'
<SPEECH 94><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	She had; and would incense me
	To murder her I married.
<SPEECH 95><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	Stars, stars!
	And all eyes else dead coals. Fear thou no wife;
	I'll have no wife, Paulina.
<SPEECH 96><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	Never, Paulina: so be bless'd my spirit!
<SPEECH 97><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>

	We shall not marry till thou bidd'st us.
<SPEECH 98><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	What with him? he comes not
	Like to his father's greatness; his approach,
	So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us
	'Tis not a visitation fram'd, but forc'd
	By need and accident. What train?
<SPEECH 99><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	His princess, say you, with him?
<SPEECH 100><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	Go, Cleomenes;
	Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,
	Bring them to our embracement. Still 'tis strange,
	He thus should steal upon us.
<SPEECH 101><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	Prithee, no more: cease! thou know'st
	He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,
	When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches
	Will bring me to consider that which may
	Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
	Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;
	For she did print your royal father off,
	Conceiving you. Were I but twenty-one,
	Your father's image is so hit in you,
	His very air, that I should call you brother,
	As I did him; and speak of something wildly
	By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!
	And you, fair princess,—goddess! O, alas!
	I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth
	Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
	You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost—
	All mine own folly—the society,
	Amity too, of your brave father, whom,
	Though bearing misery, I desire my life
	Once more to look on him.
<SPEECH 102><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	O, my brother!—
	Good gentleman,—the wrongs I have done thee stir
	Afresh within me, and these thy offices
	So rarely kind, are as interpreters
	Of my behind-hand slackness! Welcome hither,
	As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too
	Expos'd this paragon to the fearful usage—
	At least ungentle—of the dreadful Neptune,
	To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
	The adventure of her person?
<SPEECH 103><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	Where the war-like Smalus,
	That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and lov'd?
<SPEECH 104><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	The blessed gods
	Purge all infection from our air whilst you
	Do climate here! You have a holy father,
	A graceful gentleman; against whose person,
	So sacred as it is, I have done sin:
	For which the heavens, taking angry note,
	Have left me issueless; and your father's bless'd—
	As he from heaven merits it—with you,
	Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,
	Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,
	Such goodly things as you!

	You are married?

	My lord,
	Is this the daughter of a king?
<SPEECH 109><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	That 'once,' I see, by your good father's speed,
	Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,
	Most sorry, you have broken from his liking
	Where you were tied in duty; and as sorry
	Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,
	That you might well enjoy her.
<SPEECH 110><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	Would he do so, I'd beg your precious mistress,
	Which he counts but a trifle.
<SPEECH 111><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	I thought of her,
	Even in these looks I made. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> But your petition
	Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:
	Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,
	I am friend to them and you; upon which errand
	I now go toward him. Therefore follow me,
	And mark what way I make: come, good my lord.
<SPEECH 112><ACT 5><SCENE 3><95%>
	O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort
	That I have had of thee!
<SPEECH 113><ACT 5><SCENE 3><95%>
	O Paulina!
	We honour you with trouble: but we came
	To see the statue of our queen: your gallery
	Have we pass'd through, not without much content
	In many singularities, but we saw not
	That which my daughter came to look upon,
	The statue of her mother.
<SPEECH 114><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
	Her natural posture!
	Chide me, dear stone, that I may say, indeed
	Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she
	In thy not chiding, for she was as tender
	As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,
	Hermione was not so much wrinkled; nothing
	So aged as this seems.
<SPEECH 115><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
	As now she might have done,
	So much to my good comfort, as it is
	Now piercing to my soul. O! thus she stood,
	Even with such life of majesty,—warm life,
	As now it coldly stands,—when first I woo'd her.
	I am asham'd: does not the stone rebuke me
	For being more stone than it? O, royal piece!
	There's magic in thy majesty, which has
	My evils conjur'd to remembrance, and
	From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
	Standing like stone with thee.
<SPEECH 116><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	Do not draw the curtain.
<SPEECH 117><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	Let be, let be!
	Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already—
	What was he that did make it? See, my lord,
	Would you not deem it breath'd, and that those veins
	Did verily bear blood?
<SPEECH 118><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	The fixure of her eye has motion in't,
	As we are mock'd with art.
<SPEECH 119><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	O sweet Paulina!
	Make me to think so twenty years together:
	No settled senses of the world can match
	The pleasure of that madness. Let't alone.
<SPEECH 120><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	Do, Paulina;
	For this affliction has a taste as sweet
	As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,
	There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
	Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,
	For I will kiss her.
<SPEECH 121><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
	No, not these twenty years.
<SPEECH 122><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
	What you can make her do,
	I am content to look on: what to speak,
	I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy
	To make her speak as move.
<SPEECH 123><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
	Proceed:
	No foot shall stir.
<SPEECH 124><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
	</STAGE DIR> O! she's warm.
	If this be magic, let it be an art
	Lawful as eating.
<SPEECH 125><ACT 5><SCENE 3><99%>
	O! peace, Paulina.
	Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
	As I by thine a wife: this is a match,
	And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;
	But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,
	As I thought dead, and have in vain said many
	A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far,—
	For him, I partly know his mind,—to find thee
	An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,
	And take her by the hand; whose worth and honesty
	Is richly noted, and here justified
	By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.
	What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,
	That e'er I put between your holy looks
	My ill suspicion. This' your son-in-law,
	And son unto the king,—whom heavens directing,
	Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,
	Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely
	Each one demand and answer to his part
	Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
	We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.
