	For her, my lord,
	I dare my life lay down, and will do't, sir,
	Please you to accept it,—that the queen is spotless
	I' the eyes of heaven and to you: I mean,
	In this which you accuse her.

	Good my lord,—
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,

	We have always truly serv'd you, and beseech you
	So to esteem of us; and on our knees we beg,
	As recompense of our dear services
	Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,
	Which being so horrible, so bloody, must
	Lead on to some foul issue. We all kneel.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
	So please you, sir, their speed
	Hath been beyond account.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 2><38%>
	This your request
	Is altogether just: therefore, bring forth,
	And in Apollo's name, his oracle.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 2><40%>
	What fit is this, good lady?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 2><41%>
	The higher powers forbid!
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 2><41%>
	Say no more:
	Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault
	I' the boldness of your speech.
