	I would there were no age between sixteen and three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the rest; for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting. Hark you now! Would any but these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my best sheep; which I fear the wolf will sooner find than the master: if anywhere I have them, 'tis by the sea-side, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy will! what have we here? <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Mercy on's, a barne; a very pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A pretty one; a very pretty one; sure some scape: though I am not bookish, yet I can read waiting-gentlewoman in the scape. This has been some stair-work, some trunk-work, some behind-door-work; they were warmer that got this than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for pity; yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hollaed but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 3><45%>
	What! art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What ailest thou, man?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 3><45%>
	Why, boy, how is it?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 3><45%>
	Name of mercy! when was this, boy?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 3><45%>
	Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 3><46%>
	Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here, boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things dying, I with things new born. Here's a sight for thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's child! Look thee here: take up, take up, boy; open't. So, let's see: it was told me, I should be rich by the fairies: this is some changeling.â€”Open't. What's within, boy?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 3><46%>
	This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way. We are lucky, boy; and to be so still, requires nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go. Come, good boy, the next way home.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 3><46%>
	That's a good deed. If thou mayst discern by that which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the sight of him.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 3><46%>
	'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 3><55%>
	Fie, daughter! when my old wife liv'd, upon
	This day she was both pantler, butler, cook;
	Both dame and servant; welcom'd all, serv'd all,
	Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,
	At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;
	On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire
	With labour and the thing she took to quench it,
	She would to each one sip. You are retir'd,
	As if you were a feasted one and not
	The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid
	These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is
	A way to make us better friends, more known.
	Come, quench your blushes and present yourself
	That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,
	And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
	As your good flock shall prosper.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 3><59%>
	They call him Doricles, and boasts himself
	To have a worthy feeding; but I have it
	Upon his own report and I believe it:
	He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:
	I think so too; for never gaz'd the moon
	Upon the water as he'll stand and read
	As 'twere my daughter's eyes; and, to be plain,
	I think there is not half a kiss to choose
	Who loves another best.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 3><59%>
	So she does any thing, though I report it
	That should be silent. If young Doricles
	Do light upon her, she shall bring him that
	Which he not dreams of.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 3><64%>
	Away! we'll none on't: here has been too much homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 3><64%>
	Leave your prating: since these good men are pleased let them come in: but quickly now.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 3><66%>
	But, my daughter,
	Say you the like to him?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 3><66%>
	Take hands; a bargain;
	And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to't:
	I give my daughter to him, and will make
	Her portion equal his.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 3><66%>
	Come, your hand;
	And, daughter, yours.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 3><67%>
	Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
	At knowing of thy choice.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 3><67%>
	O, my heart!
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 3><68%>
	I cannot speak, nor think,
	Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
	You have undone a man of fourscore three,
	That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,
	To die upon the bed my father died,
	To lie close by his honest bones: but now
	Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
	Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch!
	That knew'st this was the prince, and wouldst adventure
	To mingle faith with him. Undone! undone!
	If I might die within this hour, I have liv'd
	To die when I desire.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
	Nay, but hear me.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
	Go to, then.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
	I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his son's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make me the king's brother-in-law.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	Well, let us to the king: there is that in this fardel will make him scratch his beard.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	To the palace, an it like your worship.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	My business, sir, is to the king.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	I know not, an't like you.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	His garments are rich, but he wears them not handsomely.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box which none must know but the king; and which he shall know within this hour if I may come to the speech of him.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	Why, sir?
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 3><79%>
	So 'tis said, sir, about his son, that should have married a shepherd's daughter.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 3><80%>
	An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for us, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 3><80%>
	Ay, sir.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 3><81%>
	Let's before as he bids us. He was provided to do us good.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	And so have I, boy.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	We may live, son, to shed many more.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are gentlemen.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	You may say it, but not swear it.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	How if it be false, son?
