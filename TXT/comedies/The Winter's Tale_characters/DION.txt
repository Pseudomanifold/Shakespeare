	I shall report,
	For most it caught me, the celestial habits,—
	Methinks I so should term them,—and the reverence
	Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!
	How ceremonious, solemn, and unearthly
	It was i' the offering!

	If the event o' the journey
	Prove as successful to the queen,—O, be't so! —
	As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,
	The time is worth the use on't.

	The violent carriage of it
	Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,
	Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,
	Shall the contents discover, something rare
	Even then will rush to knowledge.—Go:—fresh horses!
	And gracious be the issue!

	All this we swear.

	If you would not so,
	You pity not the state, nor the remembrance
	Of his most sovereign name; consider little
	What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,
	May drop upon his kingdom and devour
	Incertain lookers-on. What were more holy
	Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
	What holier than for royalty's repair,
	For present comfort, and for future good,
	To bless the bed of majesty again
	With a sweet fellow to't?
