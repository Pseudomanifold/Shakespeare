<Scene.—The Sea, with a Ship; afterwards an Island.>
</STAGE DIR>


<ACT 1>


<SCENE 1>
<On a Ship at Sea. A tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning heard.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter a Shipmaster and a Boatswain severally.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MASTER>	<1%>
	Boatswain!
</MASTER>

<BOATSWAIN>	<1%>
	Here, master: what cheer?
</BOATSWAIN>

<MASTER>	<1%>
	Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't yarely, or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

</MASTER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Mariners.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BOATSWAIN>	<1%>
	Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the master's whistle.—Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!

</BOATSWAIN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Ferdinand, Gonzalo, and others.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ALONSO>	<1%>
	Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master? Play the men.
</ALONSO>

<BOATSWAIN>	<1%>
	I pray now, keep below.
</BOATSWAIN>

<ANTONIO>	<1%>
	Where is the master, boson?
</ANTONIO>

<BOATSWAIN>	<1%>
	Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your cabins: you do assist the storm.
</BOATSWAIN>

<GONZALO>	<1%>
	Nay, good, be patient.
</GONZALO>

<BOATSWAIN>	<1%>
	When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.
</BOATSWAIN>

<GONZALO>	<1%>
	Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
</GONZALO>

<BOATSWAIN>	<1%>
	None that I more love than myself. You are a counsellor: if you can command these elements to silence, and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap.—Cheerly, good hearts!—Out of our way, I say.
</BOATSWAIN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<GONZALO>	<2%>
	I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging! make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth little advantage! If he be not born to be hanged, our case is miserable.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt.>
</STAGE DIR>

</GONZALO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Boatswain.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BOATSWAIN>	<2%>
	Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring her to try with main-course. <STAGE DIR>
<A cry within.>
</STAGE DIR> A plague upon this howling! they are louder than the weather, or our office.—

</BOATSWAIN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Sebastian, Antonio, and Gonzalo.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Yet again? what do you here? Shall we give o'er, and drown? Have you a mind to sink?
<SEBASTIAN>	<3%>
	A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!
</SEBASTIAN>

<BOATSWAIN>	<3%>
	Work you, then.
</BOATSWAIN>

<ANTONIO>	<3%>
	Hang, cur, hang! you whoreson, insolent noisemaker, we are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
</ANTONIO>

<GONZALO>	<3%>
	I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell, and as leaky as an unstanched wench.
</GONZALO>

<BOATSWAIN>	<3%>
	Lay her a-hold, a-hold! Set her two courses; off to sea again; lay her off.

</BOATSWAIN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Mariners, wet.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MIRANDA>	<3%>
	All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!
</MIRANDA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt.>
</STAGE DIR>

<BOATSWAIN>	<3%>
	What, must our mouths be cold?
</BOATSWAIN>

<GONZALO>	<3%>
	The king and prince at prayers! let us assist them,
	For our case is as theirs.
</GONZALO>

<SEBASTIAN>	<3%>
	I am out of patience.
</SEBASTIAN>

<ANTONIO>	<3%>
	We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards.—
	This wide-chapp'd rascal,—would thou might'st lie drowning,
	The washing of ten tides!
</ANTONIO>

<GONZALO>	<3%>
	He'll be hang'd yet,
	Though every drop of water swear against it,
	And gape at wid'st to glut him.
<STAGE DIR>
<A confused noise within,—'Mercy on us!'—>
</STAGE DIR>
	'We split, we split!'—'Farewell, my wife and children!'—
	'Farewell, brother!'—'We split, we split, we split!'—]
</GONZALO>

<ANTONIO>	<4%>
	Let's all sink wi' the king.
</ANTONIO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<SEBASTIAN>	<4%>
	Let's take leave of him.
</SEBASTIAN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<GONZALO>	<4%>
	Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground; long heath, brown furze, any thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain die a dry death.
</GONZALO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

</SCENE 1>


<SCENE 2>
<The Island: before the Cell of Prospero.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Prospero and Miranda.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MIRANDA>	<4%>
	If by your art, my dearest father, you have
	Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
	The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
	But that the sea, mounting to th' welkin's cheek,
	Dashes the fire out. O! I have suffer'd
	With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
	Who had, no doubt, some noble creatures in her,
	Dash'd all to pieces. O! the cry did knock
	Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
	Had I been any god of power, I would
	Have sunk the sea within the earth, or e'er
	It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
	The fraughting souls within her.
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<5%>
	Be collected:
	No more amazement. Tell your piteous heart
	There's no harm done.
</PROSPERO>

<MIRANDA>	<5%>
	O, woe the day!
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<5%>
	No harm.
	I have done nothing but in care of thee,—
	Of thee, my dear one! thee, my daughter!—who
	Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
	Of whence I am: nor that I am more better
	Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
	And thy no greater father.
</PROSPERO>

<MIRANDA>	<5%>
	More to know
	Did never meddle with my thoughts.
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<5%>
	'Tis time
	I should inform thee further. Lend thy hand,
	And pluck my magic garment from me.—So:
<STAGE DIR>
<Lays down his mantle.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Lie there, my art.—Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
	The direful spectacle of the wrack, which touch'd
	The very virtue of compassion in thee,
	I have with such provision in mine art
	So safely order'd, that there is no soul—
	No, not so much perdition as an hair,
	Betid to any creature in the vessel
	Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
	For thou must now know further.
</PROSPERO>

<MIRANDA>	<6%>
	You have often
	Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd,
	And left me to a bootless inquisition,
	Concluding, 'Stay; not yet.'
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<6%>
	The hour's now come,
	The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
	Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
	A time before we came unto this cell?
	I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
	Out three years old.
</PROSPERO>

<MIRANDA>	<6%>
	Certainly, sir, I can.
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<6%>
	By what? by any other house or person?
	Of anything the image tell me, that
	Hath kept with thy remembrance.
</PROSPERO>

<MIRANDA>	<6%>
	'Tis far off;
	And rather like a dream than an assurance
	That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
	Four or five women once that tended me?
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<6%>
	Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
	That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
	In the dark backward and abysm of time?
	If thou remember'st aught ere thou cam'st here,
	How thou cam'st here, thou may'st.
</PROSPERO>

<MIRANDA>	<7%>
	But that I do not.
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<7%>
	Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
	Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
	A prince of power.
</PROSPERO>

<MIRANDA>	<7%>
	Sir, are not you my father?
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<7%>
	Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
	She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
	Was Duke of Milan, and his only heir
	A princess,—no worse issued.
</PROSPERO>

<MIRANDA>	<7%>
	O, the heavens!
	What foul play had we that we came from thence?
	Or blessed was't we did?
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<7%>
	Both, both, my girl:
	By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heav'd thence;
	But blessedly holp hither.
</PROSPERO>

<MIRANDA>	<7%>
	O! my heart bleeds
	To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,
	Which is from my remembrance. Please you, further.
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<7%>
	My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio,—
	I pray thee, mark me,—that a brother should
	Be so perfidious!—he whom next thyself,
	Of all the world I lov'd, and to him put
	The manage of my state; as at that time,
	Through all the signiories it was the first,
	And Prospero the prime duke; being so reputed
	In dignity, and for the liberal arts,
	Without a parallel: those being all my study,
	The government I cast upon my brother,
	And to my state grew stranger, being transported
	And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle—
	Dost thou attend me?
</PROSPERO>

<MIRANDA>	<8%>
	Sir, most heedfully.
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<8%>
	Being once perfected how to grant suits,
	How to deny them, who t'advance, and who
	To trash for over-topping; new created
	The creatures that were mine, I say, or chang'd 'em,
	Or else new form'd 'em: having both the key
	Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
	To what tune pleas'd his ear; that now he was
	The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
	And suck'd my verdure out on't.—Thou attend'st not.
</PROSPERO>

<MIRANDA>	<8%>
	O, good sir! I do.
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<8%>
	I pray thee, mark me.
	I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
	To closeness and the bettering of my mind
	With that, which, but by being so retir'd,
	O'erpriz'd all popular rate, in my false brother
	Awak'd an evil nature; and my trust,
	Like a good parent, did beget of him
	A falsehood in its contrary as great
	As my trust was; which had, indeed no limit,
	A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
	Not only with what my revenue yielded,
	But what my power might else exact,—like one,
	Who having, into truth, by telling of it,
	Made such a sinner of his memory,
	To credit his own lie,—he did believe
	He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution,
	And executing th' outward face of royalty,
	With all prerogative:—Hence his ambition growing,—
	Dost thou hear?
</PROSPERO>

<MIRANDA>	<9%>
	Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<9%>
	To have no screen between this part he play'd
	And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
	Absolute Milan. Me, poor man,—my library
	Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
	He thinks me now incapable; confederates,—
	So dry he was for sway,—wi' the king of Naples
	To give him annual tribute, do him homage;
	Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend
	The dukedom, yet unbow'd,—alas, poor Milan!—
	To most ignoble stooping.
</PROSPERO>

<MIRANDA>	<10%>
	O the heavens!
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<10%>
	Mark his condition and the event; then tell me
	If this might be a brother.
</PROSPERO>

<MIRANDA>	<10%>
	I should sin
	To think but nobly of my grandmother:
	Good wombs have borne bad sons.
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<10%>
	Now the condition.
	This King of Naples, being an enemy
	To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
	Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
	Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
	Should presently extirpate me and mine
	Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan,
	With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
	A treacherous army levied, one midnight
	Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
	The gates of Milan; and, i' the dead of darkness,
	The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
	Me and thy crying self.
</PROSPERO>

<MIRANDA>	<10%>
	Alack, for pity!
	I, not rememb'ring how I cried out then,
	Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint,
	That wrings mine eyes to 't.
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<10%>
	Hear a little further,
	And then I'll bring thee to the present business
	Which now's upon us; without the which this story
	Were most impertinent.
</PROSPERO>

<MIRANDA>	<11%>
	Wherefore did they not
	That hour destroy us?
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<11%>
	Well demanded, wench:
	My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
	So dear the love my people bore me, nor set
	A mark so bloody on the business; but
	With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
	In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
	Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepar'd
	A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
	Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
	Instinctively have quit it: there they hoist us,
	To cry to the sea that roar'd to us; to sigh
	To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
	Did us but loving wrong.
</PROSPERO>

<MIRANDA>	<11%>
	Alack! what trouble
	Was I then to you!
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<11%>
	O, a cherubin
	Thou wast, that did preserve me! Thou didst smile,
	Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
	When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
	Under my burden groan'd; which rais'd in me
	An undergoing stomach, to bear up
	Against what should ensue.
</PROSPERO>

<MIRANDA>	<11%>
	How came we ashore?
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<12%>
	By Providence divine.
	Some food we had and some fresh water that
	A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
	Out of his charity,—who being then appointed
	Master of this design,—did give us; with
	Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries,
	Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
	Knowing I lov'd my books, he furnish'd me,
	From mine own library with volumes that
	I prize above my dukedom.
</PROSPERO>

<MIRANDA>	<12%>
	Would I might
	But ever see that man!
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<12%>
	Now I arise:—
<STAGE DIR>
<Resumes his mantle.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
	Here in this island we arriv'd; and here
	Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
	Than other princes can, that have more time
	For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.
</PROSPERO>

<MIRANDA>	<12%>
	Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,—
	For still 'tis beating in my mind,—your reason
	For raising this sea-storm?
</MIRANDA>

<PROSPERO>	<12%>
	Know thus far forth.
	By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
	Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
	Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
	I find my zenith doth depend upon
	A most auspicious star, whose influence
	If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
	Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions;
	Thou art inclin'd to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,
	And give it way;—I know thou canst not choose.—
<STAGE DIR>
<Miranda sleeps.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Come away, servant, come! I'm ready now.
	Approach, my Ariel; come!

</PROSPERO>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Ariel.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ARIEL>	<13%>
	All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
	To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
	To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
	On the curl'd clouds: to thy strong bidding task
	Ariel and all his quality.
</ARIEL>

<PROSPERO>	<13%>
	Hast thou, spirit,
	Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?
</PROSPERO>

<ARIEL>	<13%>
	To every article.
	I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
	Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
	I flam'd amazement: sometime I'd divide
	And burn in many places; on the topmast,
	The yards, and boresprit, would I flame distinctly,
	Then meet, and join: Jove's lightnings, the precursors
	O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
	And sight-outrunning were not: the fire and cracks
	Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
	Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
	Yea, his dread trident shake.
</ARIEL>

<PROSPERO>	<14%>
	My brave spirit!
	Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
	Would not infect his reason?
</PROSPERO>

<ARIEL>	<14%>
	Not a soul
	But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
	Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners,
	Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
	Then all a-fire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
	With hair up-staring,—then like reeds, not hair,—
	Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty,
	And all the devils are here.'
</ARIEL>

<PROSPERO>	<14%>
	Why, that's my spirit!
	But was not this nigh shore?
</PROSPERO>

<ARIEL>	<14%>
	Close by, my master.
</ARIEL>

<PROSPERO>	<14%>
	But are they, Ariel, safe?
</PROSPERO>

<ARIEL>	<14%>
	Not a hair perish'd;
	On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
	But fresher than before: and, as thou bad'st me,
	In troops I have dispers'd them 'bout the isle.
	The king's son have I landed by himself;
	Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
	In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
	His arms in this sad knot.
</ARIEL>

<PROSPERO>	<15%>
	Of the king's ship
	The mariners, say how thou hast dispos'd,
	And all the rest o' the fleet.
</PROSPERO>

<ARIEL>	<15%>
	Safely in harbour
	Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
	Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
	From the still-vex'd Bermoothes; there she's hid:
	The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
	Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
	I have left asleep: and for the rest o' the fleet
	Which I dispers'd, they all have met again,
	And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
	Bound sadly home for Naples,
	Supposing that they saw the king's ship wrack'd,
	And his great person perish.
</ARIEL>

<PROSPERO>	<15%>
	Ariel, thy charge
	Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work:
	What is the time o' th' day?
</PROSPERO>

<ARIEL>	<15%>
	Past the mid season.
</ARIEL>

<PROSPERO>	<15%>
	At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
	Must by us both be spent most preciously.
</PROSPERO>

<ARIEL>	<15%>
	Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
	Let me remember thee what thou hast promis'd
	Which is not yet perform'd me.
</ARIEL>

<PROSPERO>	<16%>
	How now! moody?
	What is't thou canst demand?
</PROSPERO>

<ARIEL>	<16%>
	My liberty.
</ARIEL>

<PROSPERO>	<16%>
	Before the time be out? no more!
</PROSPERO>

<ARIEL>	<16%>
	I prithee
	Remember, I have done thee worthy service;
	Told thee no lies, made no mistakings, serv'd
	Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
	To bate me a full year.
</ARIEL>

<PROSPERO>	<16%>
	Dost thou forget
	From what a torment I did free thee?
</PROSPERO>

<ARIEL>	<16%>
	No.
</ARIEL>

<PROSPERO>	<16%>
	Thou dost; and think'st it much to tread the ooze
	Of the salt deep,
	To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
	To do me business in the veins o' th' earth
	When it is bak'd with frost.
</PROSPERO>

<ARIEL>	<16%>
	I do not, sir.
</ARIEL>

<PROSPERO>	<16%>
	Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
	The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
	Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?
</PROSPERO>

<ARIEL>	<16%>
	No, sir.
</ARIEL>

<PROSPERO>	<16%>
	Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.
</PROSPERO>

<ARIEL>	<16%>
	Sir, in Argier.
</ARIEL>

<PROSPERO>	<16%>
	O! was she so? I must,
	Once in a month, recount what thou hast been,
	Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch, Sycorax,
	For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
	To enter human hearing, from Argier,
	Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did
	They would not take her life. Is not this true?
</PROSPERO>

<ARIEL>	<17%>
	Ay, sir.
</ARIEL>

<PROSPERO>	<17%>
	This blue-ey'd hag was hither brought with child
	And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
	As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant:
	And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
	To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
	Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
	By help of her more potent ministers,
	And in her most unmitigable rage,
	Into a cloven pine; within which rift
	Imprison'd, thou didst painfully remain
	A dozen years; within which space she died
	And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans
	As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island,—
	Save for the son that she did litter here,
	A freckled whelp hag-born,—not honour'd with
	A human shape.

	That burn by day and night: and then I lov'd thee
	And show'd thee all the qualities o' th' isle,
	The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place, and fertile.
	Cursed be I that did so!—All the charms

	With words that made them known: but thy vile race,
	Though thou didst learn, had that in't which good natures

	You cram these words into mine ears, against

	Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
	My son is lost; and, in my rate, she too,
	Who is so far from Italy remov'd,
	I ne'er again shall see her. O thou, mine heir
	Of Naples and of Milan! what strange fish
	Hath made his meal on thee?
</ALONSO>

<FRANCISCO>	<33%>
	Sir, he may live:
	I saw him beat the surges under him,
	And ride upon their backs: he trod the water,
	Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
	The surge most swoln that met him: his bold head
	'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
	Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
	To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
	As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt
	He came alive to land.

	No, no; he's gone.

<SEBASTIAN>	<34%>
	Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
	That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,

	Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
	Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.

	You were kneel'd to and importun'd otherwise
	By all of us; and the fair soul herself
	Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
	Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your son,
	I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
	More widows in them of this business' making,
	Than we bring men to comfort them: the fault's
	Your own.

	'Tis true my brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis;

<ANTONIO>	<40%>
	A space whose every cubit
	Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel
	Measure us back to Naples?—Keep in Tunis,
	And let Sebastian wake!'—Say, this were death
	That now hath seiz'd them; why, they were no worse
	Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
	As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
	As amply and unnecessarily
	As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
	A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore

A fish: he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,—as once I was,—and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver: there would this monster make a man; any strange beast there makes a man. When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg'd like a man! and his fins like arms! Warm, o' my troth!

	There be some sports are painful, and their labour

	The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead
	And makes my labours pleasures: O! she is
	Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,
	And he's compos'd of harshness. I must remove
	Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,
	Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress
	Weeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness
	Had never like executor. I forget:

	Admir'd Miranda!
	Indeed, the top of admiration; worth
	What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
	I have ey'd with best regard, and many a time
	The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
	Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues
	Have I lik'd several women; never any
	With so full soul but some defect in her
	Did quarrel with the noblest grace she ow'd,
	And put it to the foil: but you, O you!
	So perfect and so peerless, are created
	Of every creature's best.

	I am skill-less of; but, by my modesty,—
	The jewel in my dower,—I would not wish
	Any companion in the world but you;
	Nor can imagination form a shape,
	Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
	Something too wildly and my father's precepts
	I therein do forget.
</MIRANDA>

<FERDINAND>	<55%>
	I am in my condition

	He has brave utensils,—for so he calls them,—
	Which, when he has a house, he'll deck withal:
	And that most deeply to consider is

	You are three men of sin, whom Destiny—

	Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs
	Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
	One dowle that's in my plume; my fellow-ministers

	Your swords are now too massy for your strengths,
	And will not be uplifted. But, remember,—
	For that's my business to you,—that you three
	From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
	Expos'd unto the sea, which hath requit it,
	Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed
	The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
	Incens'd the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
	Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
	They have bereft; and do pronounce, by me,
	Lingering perdition,—worse than any death
	Can be at once,—shall step by step attend
	You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from—
	Which here in this most desolate isle, else falls
	Upon your heads,—is nothing but heart-sorrow

	In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;
	They cannot budge till your release. The king,
	His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,
	And the remainder mourning over them,
	Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly
	Him, that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo:'
	His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
	From eaves of reeds; your charm so strongly works them,
	That if you now beheld them, your affections
	Would become tender.

	The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
	And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault
	Set roaring war: to the dread-rattling thunder
	Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak
	With his own bolt: the strong-bas'd promontory
	Have I made shake; and by the spurs pluck'd up
	The pine and cedar: graves at my command
