	Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain; he was then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I could then have looked on him without the help of admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.

	Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment, which else an easy battery might lay flat, for taking a beggar without less quality.

	You may wear her in little yours, but, you know, strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your ring may be stolen, too; so your brace of unprizeable estimations, the one is but frail and the other causal; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.

	I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring, which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it something; but I make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation; and, to bar your offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any lady in the world.

	Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe. I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring, that, commend me to the court where your lady is, with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference, and I will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.

	Country call'd his; and you his mistress, only
	For the most worthiest fit. Give me your pardon.
	I have spoken this, to know if your affiance
	Were deeply rooted, and shall make your lord
	That which he is, new o'er; and he is one
	The truest manner'd; such a holy witch
	That he enchants societies into him;
	Half all men's hearts are his.

	He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:
	He hath a kind of honour sets him off,
	More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,
	Most mighty princess, that I have adventur'd
	To try your taking of a false report; which hath
	Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment
	In the election of a sir so rare,
	Which you know cannot err. The love I bear him
	Made me to fan you thus; but the gods made you,
	Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 1><SCENE 6><21%>
	My humble thanks. I had almost forget

	Some dozen Romans of us and your lord,

	Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;
	And I am something curious, being strange,

	They are in a trunk,

	The crickets sing, and man's o'erlabour'd sense
	Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus
	Did softly press the rushes ere he waken'd
	The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,
	How bravely thou becom'st thy bed! freshlily,
	And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!
	But kiss: one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,
	How dearly they do 't! 'Tis her breathing that
	Perfumes the chamber thus; the flame of the taper
	Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,
	To see the enclosed lights, now canopied
	Under these windows, white and azure lac'd
	With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,
	To note the chamber: I will write all down:
	Such and such pictures; there the window; such
	Th' adornment of her bed; the arras, figures,
	Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.
	Ah! but some natural notes about her body,
	Above ten thousand meaner moveables
	Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.
	O sleep! thou ape of death, lie dull upon her;
	And be her senses but as a monument
	Thus in a chapel lying. Come off, come off;—
	As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!
	'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,
	As strongly as the conscience does within,
	To the madding of her lord. On her left breast
	A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
	I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher;
	Stronger than ever law could make: this secret
	Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en
	The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?
	Why should I write this down, that's riveted,
	Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late
	The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down
	Where Philomel gave up. I have enough:
	To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.
	Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning
	May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;
	Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.
	One, two, three: time, time!

	Good sir, we must,

	Together with your ring; and not the wronger

	Sir, my circumstances

	First, her bedchamber,—

	With tapestry of silk and silver; the story
	Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,
	And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for
	The press of boats or pride; a piece of work
	So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive

	Could be rarely and exactly wrought,

	Sir,—I thank her,—that:

	All too soon I shall,

	He was as calm as virtue,—he began

	Your daughter's chastity, there it begins.
	He spake of her as Dian had hot dreams,
	And she alone were cold; whereat I, wretch,
	Made scruple of his praise, and wager'd with him
	Pieces of gold 'gainst this, which then he wore
	Upon his honour'd finger, to attain
	In suit the place of his bed, and win this ring
	By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,
	No lesser of her honour confident
	Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;
	And would so, had it been a carbuncle
	Of Phœbus' wheel; and might so safely, had it
	Been all the worth of 's car. Away to Britain
	Post I in this design. Well may you, sir,
	Remember me at court, where I was taught
	Of your chaste daughter the wide difference
	'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'd
	Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain
	'Gan in your duller Britain operate
	Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent;
	And, to be brief, my practice so prevail'd,
	That I return'd with simular proof enough
	To make the noble Leonatus mad,
	By wounding his belief in her renown
	With tokens thus, and thus; averring notes
	Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet;—
	Oh cunning! how I got it!—nay, some marks
	Of secret on her person, that he could not
	But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,
	I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon,—
	Methinks I see him now,—
<SPEECH 77><ACT 5><SCENE 5><98%>
	</STAGE DIR> I am down again;
	But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,
	As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,

	That ever swore her faith.
