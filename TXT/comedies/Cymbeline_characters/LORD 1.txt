	Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the violence of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice. Where air comes out, air comes in; there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.

	Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass if he be not hurt; it is a throughfare for steel if it be not hurt.

	Stand you! You have land enough of your own; but he added to your having, gave you some ground.

	Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain go not together; she's a good sign, but I have seen small reflection of her wit.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	I'll attend your lordship.

	What got he by that? You have broke his pate with your bowl.

	Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?

	There's an Italian come; and 'tis thought, one of Leonatus' friends.

	Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the most coldest that ever turned up ace.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 3><26%>
	But not every man patient after the noble temper of your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.

	Good my liege,
	The day that she was missing he was here;
	I dare be bound he's true and shall perform
	All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,
	There wants no diligence in seeking him,
	And will, no doubt, be found.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 3><72%>
	So please-your majesty,
	The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
	Are landed on your coast, with a supply
	Of Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 3><72%>
	Good my liege,
	Your preparation can affront no less
	Than what you hear of; come more, for more you're ready:
	The want is, but to put those powers in motion
	That long to move.
