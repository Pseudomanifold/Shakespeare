	His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I have been often bound for no less than my life. Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your knowing, to a stranger of his quality.
	I beseech you all, be better known to this gentleman, whom I commend to you, as a noble friend of mine; how worthy he is I will leave to appear hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.

	Let us leave here, gentlemen.

	Gentlemen, enough of this; it came in too suddenly; let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be better acquainted.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 4><13%>
	I will have it no lay.

	Signior Iachimo will not from it. Pray, let us follow 'em.

	What means do you make to him?

	Your very goodness and your company
	O'erpays all I can do. By this, your king
	Hath heard of great Augustus; Caius Lucius
	Will do 's commission throughly, and I think
	He'll grant the tribute, send the arrearages,
	Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance
	Is yet fresh in their grief.

	Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
	When you were there?

	Have patience, sir,
	And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:
	It may be probable she lost it; or
	Who knows if one of her women, being corrupted,
	Hath stol'n it from her?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	Sir, be patient:
	This is not strong enough to be believ'd
	Of one persuaded well ofâ€”
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
	Quite besides
	The government of patience! You have won:
	Let's follow him, and pervert the present wrath
	He hath against himself.
