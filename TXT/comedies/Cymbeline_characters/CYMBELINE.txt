	A worthy fellow,
	Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;
	But that's no fault of his: we must receive him
	According to the honour of his sender;
	And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,
	We must extend our notice. Our dear son,
	When you have given good morning to your mistress,
	Attend the queen and us; we shall have need
	To employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><36%>
	Now say what would Augustus Cæsar with us?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><37%>
	Son, let your mother end.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 1><38%>
	You must know,
	Till the injurious Romans did extort
	This tribute from us, we were free; Cæsar's ambition—
	Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch
	The sides o' the world—against all colour here
	Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off
	Becomes a war-like people, whom we reckon
	Ourselves to be. We do say then to Cæsar
	Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
	Ordain'd our laws, whose use the sword of Cæsar
	Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise
	Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,
	Though Rome be therefore angry. Mulmutius made our laws,
	Who was the first of Britain which did put
	His brows within a golden crown, and call'd
	Himself a king.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 1><38%>
	Thou art welcome, Caius.
	Thy Cæsar knighted me; my youth I spent
	Much under him; of him I gather'd honour;
	Which he, to seek of me again, perforce,
	Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect
	That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
	Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent
	Which not to read would show the Britons cold:
	So Cæsar shall not find them.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 1><39%>
	I know your master's pleasure and he mine:
	All the remain is 'Welcome!'
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 5><50%>
	Thus far; and so farewell.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 5><50%>
	Our subjects, sir,

<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 5><50%>
	My lords, you are appointed for that office;

	So, farewell, noble Lucius.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 5><50%>
	Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,
	Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 5><50%>
	Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor
	How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely
	Our chariots and horsemen be in readiness;
	The powers that he already hath in Gallia
	Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves
	His war for Britain.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 5><51%>
	Our expectation that it would be thus
	Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,
	Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd
	Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd
	The duty of the day; she looks us like
	A thing more made of malice than of duty:
	We have noted it. Call her before us, for
	We have been too slight in sufferance.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 5><51%>
	Where is she, sir? How
	Can her contempt be answer'd?
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 5><51%>
	Her doors lock'd!
	Not seen of late! Grant, heavens, that which I fear
	Prove false!
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 3><72%>
	Again; and bring me word how 'tis with her.
	A fever with the absence of her son,
	A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens!
	How deeply you at once do touch me. Imogen,
	The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen
	Upon a desperate bed, and in a time
	When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,
	So needful for this present: it strikes me, past
	The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,
	Who needs must know of her departure and
	Dost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from thee
	By a sharp torture.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 3><72%>
	The time is troublesome.
	</STAGE DIR> We'll slip you for a season; but our jealousy
	Does yet depend.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 3><72%>
	Now for the counsel of my son and queen!
	I am amaz'd with matter.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 3><73%>
	I thank you. Let's withdraw;
	And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not

	We grieve at chances here. Away!
<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 5><86%>
	Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made
	Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart
	That the poor soldier that so richly fought,
	Whose rags sham'd gilded arms, whose naked breast
	Stepp'd before targes of proof, cannot be found:
	He shall be happy that can find him, if
	Our grace can make him so.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 5><86%>
	No tidings of him?
<SPEECH 32><ACT 5><SCENE 5><86%>
	To my grief, I am
	The heir of his reward; which I will add
	To you, the liver, heart, and brain of Britain,
	By whom, I grant, she lives. 'Tis now the time
	To ask of whence you are: report it.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 5><SCENE 5><86%>
	Bow your knees.
	Arise, my knights o' the battle: I create you
	Companions to our person, and will fit you
	With dignities becoming your estates.
	There's business in these faces. Why so sadly
	Greet you our victory? you look like Romans,
	And not o' the court of Britain.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 5><86%>
	Whom worse than a physician
	Would this report become? But I consider,
	By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet death

<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 5><87%>
	Prithee, say.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 5><SCENE 5><87%>

	O most delicate fiend!

	Heard you all this, her women?

	Mine eyes
	Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;
	Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,
	That thought her like her seeming: it had been vicious
	To have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!
	That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,
	And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!
	Thou com'st not, Caius, now for tribute; that
	The Britons have raz'd out, though with the loss
	Of many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suit
	That their good souls may be appeas'd with slaughter
	Of you their captives, which ourself have granted:
	So, think of your estate.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 5><SCENE 5><88%>
	I have surely seen him;
	His favour is familiar to me. Boy,
	Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,
	And art mine own. I know not why nor wherefore,
	To say, 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:
	And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,
	Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;
	Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,
	The noblest ta'en.

	What wouldst thou, boy?

	Wherefore ey'st him so?
<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 5><89%>

	</STAGE DIR> Sir, step you forth;

	Which is our honour, bitter torture shall

	How parted with your brothers? how first met them?
	Why fied you from the court, and whither? These,

	I know not how much more, should be demanded,
	And all the other by-dependances,
	From chance to chance, but nor the time nor place

	And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye

	Well;

	Although the victor, we submit to Cæsar,
	And to the Roman empire; promising
	To pay our wonted tribute, from the which
	We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;
	Whom heavens—in justice both on her and hers—
	Have laid most heavy hand.
<SPEECH 80><ACT 5><SCENE 5><100%>
	Laud we the gods;
	And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
	From our bless'd altars. Publish we this peace
	To all our subjects. Set we forward: let
	A Roman and a British ensign wave
	Friendly together; so through Lud's town march:
	And in the temple of great Jupiter
	Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.
	Set on there. Never was a war did cease,
	Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
