	No more, thou thunder-master, show
	Thy spite on mortal flies:
	With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,
	That thy adulteries
	Rates and revenges.
	Hath my poor boy done aught but well,
	Whose face I never saw?
	I died whilst in the womb he stay'd
	Attending nature's law:
	Whose father then—as men report,
	Thou orphans' father art—
	Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him
	From this earth-vexing smart.

	Great nature, like his ancestry,
	Moulded the stuff so fair,
	That he deserv'd the praise o' the world,
	As great Sicilius' heir.

	Why did you suffer Iachimo,
	Slight thing of Italy,
	To taint his nobler heart and brain
	With needless jealousy;
	And to become the geck and scorn
	O' the other's villany?

	Thy crystal window ope; look out;
	No longer exercise
	Upon a valiant race thy harsh
	And potent injuries.

	Peep through thy marble mansion; help!
	Or we poor ghosts will cry
	To the shining synod of the rest
	Against thy deity.

	He came in thunder; his celestial breath
	Was sulphurous to smell; the holy eagle
	Stoop'd, as to foot us; his ascension is
	More sweet than our bless'd fields; his royal bird
	Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak,
	As when his god is pleas'd.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 5><SCENE 4><83%>
	The marble pavement closes; he is enter'd
	His radiant roof. Away! and, to be blest,
	Let us with care perform his great behest.
