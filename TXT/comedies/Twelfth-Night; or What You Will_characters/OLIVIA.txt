<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 5><13%>
	Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you: besides, you grow dishonest.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
	Sir, I bade them take away you.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
	Can you do it?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
	Make your proof.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
	Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
	Good fool, for my brother's death.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
	I know his soul is in heaven, fool.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
	What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
	How say you to that, Malvolio?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 5><15%>
	O! you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition, is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets. There is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet man, though he do nothing but reprove.

	From the Count Orsino, is it?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 5><15%>
	Who of my people hold him in delay?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 5><15%>
	Fetch him off, I pray you: he speaks nothing but madman. Fie on him! <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and people dislike it.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 5><16%>
	By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 5><16%>
	A gentleman! what gentleman?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 5><16%>
	Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 5><16%>
	What's a drunken man like, fool?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 5><17%>
	Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my coz; for he's in the third degree of drink, he's drowned: go, look after him.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 5><17%>
	Tell him he shall not speak with me.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 5><17%>
	What kind o' man is he?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 5><17%>
	What manner of man?

<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 5><18%>
	Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 5><18%>
	Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face.
	We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 5><18%>
	Speak to me; I shall answer for her.
	Your will?
<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 5><18%>
	Whence came you, sir?
<SPEECH 28><ACT 1><SCENE 5><19%>
	Are you a comedian?
<SPEECH 29><ACT 1><SCENE 5><19%>
	If I do not usurp myself, I am.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 1><SCENE 5><19%>
	Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 1><SCENE 5><19%>
	It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates, and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 1><SCENE 5><19%>
	Tell me your mind.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 1><SCENE 5><19%>
	Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 1><SCENE 5><20%>
	Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?
<SPEECH 35><ACT 1><SCENE 5><20%>
	Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Now, sir; what is your text?
<SPEECH 36><ACT 1><SCENE 5><20%>
	A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it. Where lies your text?
<SPEECH 37><ACT 1><SCENE 5><20%>
	In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?
<SPEECH 38><ACT 1><SCENE 5><20%>
	O! I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?
<SPEECH 39><ACT 1><SCENE 5><20%>
	Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face? you are now out of your text: but we will draw the curtain and show you the picture. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Look you, sir, such a one I was as this present: is't not well done?
<SPEECH 40><ACT 1><SCENE 5><21%>
	'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 1><SCENE 5><21%>
	O! sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be inventoried, and every particle and utensil labelled to my will: as Item, Two lips, indifferent red; Item, Two grey eyes, with lids to them; Item, One neck, one chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise me?
<SPEECH 42><ACT 1><SCENE 5><21%>
	How does he love me?
<SPEECH 43><ACT 1><SCENE 5><21%>
	Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him;
	Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
	Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
	In voices well divulg'd, free, learn'd, and valiant;
	And, in dimension and the shape of nature
	A gracious person; but yet I cannot love him:
	He might have took his answer long ago.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 1><SCENE 5><22%>
	Why, what would you?
<SPEECH 45><ACT 1><SCENE 5><22%>
	You might do much. What is your parentage?
<SPEECH 46><ACT 1><SCENE 5><22%>
	Get you to your lord:
	I cannot love him. Let him send no more,
	Unless, perchance, you come to me again,
	To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:
	I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 1><SCENE 5><23%>
	'What is your parentage?'
	'Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
	I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art:
	Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit,
	Do give thee five-fold blazon. Not too fast: soft! soft!
	Unless the master were the man. How now!
	Even so quickly may one catch the plague?
	Methinks I feel this youth's perfections
	With an invisible and subtle stealth
	To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.
	What, ho! Malvolio!
<SPEECH 48><ACT 1><SCENE 5><23%>
	Run after that same peevish messenger,
	The county's man: he left this ring behind him,
	Would I, or not: tell him I'll none of it.
	Desire him not to flatter with his lord,
	Nor hold him up with hopes: I'm not for him.
	If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,
	I'll give him reasons for't. Hie thee, Malvolio.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 1><SCENE 5><23%>
	I do I know not what, and fear to find
	Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.
	Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe;
	What is decreed must be, and be this so!
<SPEECH 50><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.
	Give me your hand, sir.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	What is your name?
<SPEECH 52><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world
	Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment.
	You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,
	Would they were blanks rather than fill'd with me!
<SPEECH 54><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	O! by your leave, I pray you,
	I bade you never speak again of him:
	But, would you undertake another suit,
	I had rather hear you to solicit that
	Than music from the spheres.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,
	After the last enchantment you did here,
	A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse
	Myself, my servant, and, I fear me, you:
	Under your hard construction must I sit,
	To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,
	Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?
	Have you not set mine honour at the stake,
	And baited it with all th' unmuzzled thoughts
	That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving
	Enough is shown; a cypress, not a bosom,
	Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	That's a degree to love.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	Why, then methinks 'tis time to smile again.
	O world! how apt the poor are to be proud.
	If one should be a prey, how much the better
	To fall before the lion than the wolf!
	The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
	Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:
	And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,
	Your wife is like to reap a proper man:
	There lies your way, due west.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	Stay:
	I prithee, tell me what thou think'st of me.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 3><SCENE 1><53%>
	If I think so, I think the same of you.
<SPEECH 60><ACT 3><SCENE 1><53%>
	I would you were as I would have you be!
<SPEECH 61><ACT 3><SCENE 1><53%>
	O! what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
	In the contempt and anger of his lip.
	A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
	Than love that would seem hid; love's night is noon.
	Cesario, by the roses of the spring,
	By maidhood, honour, truth, and every thing,
	I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,
	Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
	Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
	For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause;
	But rather reason thus with reason fetter,
	Love sought is good, but giv'n unsought is better.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 3><SCENE 1><53%>
	Yet come again, for thou perhaps mayst move
	That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
	I have sent after him: he says he'll come;
	How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?
	For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.
	I speak too loud.
	Where is Malvolio? he is sad, and civil,
	And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:
	Where is Malvolio?
<SPEECH 64><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
	Why, what's the matter? does he rave?
<SPEECH 65><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
	Go call him hither.
	I am as mad as he,
	If sad and merry madness equal be.
	How now, Malvolio!
<SPEECH 66><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
	Smil'st thou?
	I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.
<SPEECH 67><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
	Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?
<SPEECH 68><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
	Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?
<SPEECH 69><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
	God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss thy hand so oft?
<SPEECH 70><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
	What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?
<SPEECH 71><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
	Ha!
<SPEECH 72><ACT 3><SCENE 4><61%>
	What sayst thou?
<SPEECH 73><ACT 3><SCENE 4><61%>
	Heaven restore thee!
<SPEECH 74><ACT 3><SCENE 4><61%>
	Thy yellow stockings!
<SPEECH 75><ACT 3><SCENE 4><61%>
	Cross-gartered!
<SPEECH 76><ACT 3><SCENE 4><61%>
	Am I made?
<SPEECH 77><ACT 3><SCENE 4><61%>
	Why, this is very midsummer madness.
<SPEECH 78><ACT 3><SCENE 4><61%>
	I'll come to him. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where's my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special care of him: I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry.
<SPEECH 79><ACT 3><SCENE 4><67%>
	I have said too much unto a heart of stone,
	And laid mine honour too unchary out:
	There's something in me that reproves my fault,
	But such a headstrong potent fault it is
	That it but mocks reproof.
<SPEECH 80><ACT 3><SCENE 4><67%>
	Here; wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture;
	Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;
	And I beseech you come again to-morrow.
	What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,
	That honour sav'd may upon asking give?
<SPEECH 81><ACT 3><SCENE 4><67%>
	How with mine honour may I give him that
	Which I have given to you?
<SPEECH 82><ACT 3><SCENE 4><67%>
	Well, come again to-morrow: fare thee well:
	A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.
<SPEECH 83><ACT 4><SCENE 1><77%>
	Hold, Toby! on thy life I charge thee, hold!
<SPEECH 84><ACT 4><SCENE 1><77%>
	Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch!
	Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,
	Where manners ne'er were preach'd. Out of my sight!
	Be not offended, dear Cesario.
	Rudesby, be gone!
	I prithee, gentle friend,
	Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway
	In this uncivil and unjust extent
	Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,
	And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
	This ruffian hath botch'd up, that thou thereby
	Mayst smile at this. Thou shalt not choose but go:
	Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,
	He started one poor heart of mine in thee.
<SPEECH 85><ACT 4><SCENE 1><78%>
	Nay; come, I prithee. Would thou'dst be rul'd by me!
<SPEECH 86><ACT 4><SCENE 1><78%>
	O! say so, and so be!
<SPEECH 87><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
	Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,
	Now go with me and with this holy man
	Into the chantry by; there, before him,
	And underneath that consecrated roof,
	Plight me the full assurance of your faith;
	That my most jealous and too doubtful soul
	May live at peace. He shall conceal it
	Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,
	What time we will our celebration keep
	According to my birth. What do you say?
<SPEECH 88><ACT 4><SCENE 3><84%>
	Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine
	That they may fairly note this act of mine!
<SPEECH 89><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	What would my lord, but that he may not have,
	Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?
	Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.
<SPEECH 90><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,—
<SPEECH 91><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,
	It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
	As howling after music.
<SPEECH 92><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	Still so constant, lord.
<SPEECH 93><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.
<SPEECH 94><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	Where goes Cesario?
<SPEECH 95><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	Ah me, detested! how am I beguil'd!
<SPEECH 96><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	Hast thou forgot thyself? Is it so long?
	Call forth the holy father.
<SPEECH 97><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.
<SPEECH 98><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	Ay, husband: can he that deny?
<SPEECH 99><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	Alas! it is the baseness of thy fear
	That makes thee strangle thy propriety.
	Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up;
	Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art
	As great as that thou fear'st.
	O, welcome, father!
	Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,
	Here to unfold,—though lately we intended
	To keep in darkness what occasion now
	Reveals before 'tis ripe,—what thou dost know
	Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.
<SPEECH 100><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	O! do not swear:
	Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.
<SPEECH 101><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	What's the matter?
<SPEECH 102><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	Who has done this, Sir Andrew?
<SPEECH 103><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?
<SPEECH 104><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to.
<SPEECH 105><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	Most wonderful!
<SPEECH 106><ACT 5><SCENE 1><95%>
	He shall enlarge him. Fetch Malvolio hither.
	And yet, alas, now I remember me,
	They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.
	A most extracting frenzy of mine own
	From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.
	How does he, sirrah?
<SPEECH 107><ACT 5><SCENE 1><95%>
	Open it, and read it.
<SPEECH 108><ACT 5><SCENE 1><95%>
	How now! art thou mad?
<SPEECH 109><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
	Prithee, read i' thy right wits.
<SPEECH 110><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
	</STAGE DIR> Read it you, sirrah.
<SPEECH 111><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
	Did he write this?
<SPEECH 112><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
	See him deliver'd, Fabian; bring him hither.
	My lord, so please you, these things further thought on,
	To think me as well a sister as a wife,
	One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,
	Here at my house and at my proper cost.
<SPEECH 113><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
	A sister! you are she.
<SPEECH 114><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
	Ay, my lord, this same.
	How now, Malvolio!
<SPEECH 115><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
	Have I, Malvolio? no.
<SPEECH 116><ACT 5><SCENE 1><98%>
	Alas! Malvolio, this is not my writing,
	Though, I confess, much like the character;
	But, out of question, 'tis Maria's hand:
	And now I do bethink me, it was she
	First told me thou wast mad; then cam'st in smiling,
	And in such forms which here were presuppos'd
	Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:
	This practice hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;
	But when we know the grounds and authors of it,
	Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
	Of thine own cause.
<SPEECH 117><ACT 5><SCENE 1><98%>
	Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!
<SPEECH 118><ACT 5><SCENE 1><99%>
	He hath been most notoriously abus'd.
