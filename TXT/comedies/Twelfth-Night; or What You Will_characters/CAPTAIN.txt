	This is Illyria, lady.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><2%>
	It is perchance that you yourself were sav'd.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><2%>
	True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
	Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
	When you and those poor number sav'd with you
	Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
	Most provident in peril, bind himself,—
	Courage and hope both teaching him the practice,—
	To a strong mast that liv'd upon the sea;
	Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
	I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
	So long as I could see.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
	Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
	Not three hours' travel from this very place.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
	A noble duke, in nature as in name.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
	Orsino.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
	And so is now, or was so very late;
	For but a month ago I went from hence,
	And then 'twas fresh in murmur,—as, you know,
	What great ones do the less will prattle of,—
	That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
	A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
	That died some twelvemonth since; then leaving her
	In the protection of his son, her brother,
	Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,
	They say she hath abjur'd the company
	And sight of men.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 2><4%>
	That were hard to compass,
	Because she will admit no kind of suit,
	No, not the duke's.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 2><4%>
	Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:
	When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
