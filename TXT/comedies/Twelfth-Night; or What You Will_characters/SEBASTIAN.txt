	By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over me; the malignancy of my fate might, perhaps, distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in; therefore, it charges me in manners the rather to express myself. You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo. My father was that Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased, would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that; for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but, though I could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly publish her: she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	O good Antonio! forgive me your trouble!
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	If you will not undo what you have done, that is, kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not. Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness; and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
	I would not by my will have troubled you;
	But since you make your pleasure of your pains,
	I will no further chide you.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
	My kind Antonio,
	I can no other answer make but thanks,
	And thanks, and ever thanks; for oft good turns
	Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay:
	But, were my worth, as is my conscience, firm,
	You should find better dealing. What's to do?
	Shall we go see the reliques of this town?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
	I am not weary, and 'tis long to night:
	I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes
	With the memorials and the things of fame
	That do renown this city.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
	Belike you slew great number of his people?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
	Do not then walk too open.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	Why I your purse?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you for an hour.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	I do remember.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 1><75%>
	Go to, go to; thou art a foolish fellow:
	Let me be clear of thee.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 1><75%>
	I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else:
	Thou know'st not me.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 1><75%>
	I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me:
	There's money for thee: if you tarry longer
	I shall give worse payment.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 1><76%>
	Why, there's for thee, and there, and there, and there!
	Are all the people mad?
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 1><76%>
	Let go thy hand.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 1><77%>
	I will be free from thee. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> What wouldst thou now?
	If thou dar'st tempt me further, draw thy sword.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 1><77%>
	What relish is in this? how runs the stream?
	Or I am mad, or else this is a dream:
	Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;
	If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 1><78%>
	Madam, I will.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
	This is the air; that is the glorious sun; This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't;
	And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,
	Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio then?
	I could not find him at the Elephant;
	Yet there he was, and there I found this credit,
	That he did range the town to seek me out.
	His counsel now might do me golden service;
	For though my soul disputes well with my sense
	That this may be some error, but no madness,
	Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
	So far exceed all instance, all discourse,
	That I am ready to distrust mine eyes,
	And wrangle with my reason that persuades me
	To any other trust but that I am mad
	Or else the lady's mad: yet, if 'twere so,
	She could not sway her house, command her followers,
	Take and give back affairs and their dispatch
	With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing
	As I perceive she does. There's something in't
	That is deceivable. But here the lady comes.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 3><84%>
	I'll follow this good man, and go with you;
	And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman;
	But, had it been the brother of my blood,
	I must have done no less with wit and safety.
	You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that
	I do perceive it hath offended you:
	Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
	We made each other but so late ago.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	Antonio! O my dear Antonio!
	How have the hours rack'd and tortur'd me
	Since I have lost thee!
<SPEECH 26><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	Fear'st thou that, Antonio?
<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	Do I stand there? I never had a brother;
	Nor can there be that deity in my nature,
	Of here and every where. I had a sister,
	Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.
	Of charity, what kin are you to me?
	What countryman? what name? what parentage?
<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	A spirit I am indeed;
	But am in that dimension grossly clad
	Which from the womb I did participate.
	Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,
	I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,
	And say, 'Thrice welcome, drowned Viola!'
<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
	And so had mine.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
	O! that record is lively in my soul.
	He finished indeed his mortal act
	That day that made my sister thirteen years.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
	</STAGE DIR> So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:
	But nature to her bias drew in that.
	You would have been contracted to a maid;
	Nor are you therein, by my life, deceiv'd,
	You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.
