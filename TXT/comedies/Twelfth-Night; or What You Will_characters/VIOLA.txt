	Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you sailors?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><2%>
	O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
	For saying so there's gold.
	Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,

	Who governs here?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
	What is his name?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
	What's she?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 2><4%>
	O! that I serv'd that lady,
	And might not be deliver'd to the world,

	What my estate is.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 2><4%>
	There is a fair behaviour in thee, captain;
	And though that nature with a beauteous wall
	Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
	I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
	With this thy fair and outward character.
	I prithee,—and I'll pay thee bounteously,—
	Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
	For such disguise as haply shall become
	The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
	Thou shalt present me as a eunuch to him:
	It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
	And speak to him in many sorts of music
	That will allow me very worth his service.
	What else may hap to time I will commit;
	Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 2><4%>
	I thank thee: lead me on.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 4><10%>
	You either fear his humour or my negligence, that you call in question the continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 4><10%>
	I thank you. Here comes the count.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 4><10%>
	On your attendance, my lord; here.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 4><10%>
	Sure, my noble lord,

<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 4><11%>
	Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 4><11%>
	I think not so, my lord.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 4><11%>
	I'll do my best

<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 5><18%>
	The honourable lady of the house, which is she?
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 5><18%>
	Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty,—I pray you tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away my speech; for, besides that it is excellently well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 5><18%>
	I can say little more than I have studied, and that question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 5><19%>
	No, my profound heart; and yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear I am not that I play. Are you the lady of the house?
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 5><19%>
	Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for, what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will on with my speech in your praise, and then show you the heart of my message.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 5><19%>
	Alas! I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 5><19%>
	No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 5><19%>
	I am a messenger.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 5><20%>
	It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my hand; my words are as full of peace as matter.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 1><SCENE 5><20%>
	The rudeness that hath appear'd in me have I learn'd from my entertainment. What I am, and what I would, are as secret as maiden-head; to your ears, divinity; to any other's, profanation.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 1><SCENE 5><20%>
	Most sweet lady,—
<SPEECH 30><ACT 1><SCENE 5><20%>
	In Orsino's bosom.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 1><SCENE 5><20%>
	To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 1><SCENE 5><20%>
	Good madam, let me see your face.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 1><SCENE 5><21%>
	Excellently done, if God did all.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 1><SCENE 5><21%>
	'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
	Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:
	Lady, you are tho cruell'st she alive,
	If you will lead these graces to the grave
	And leave the world no copy.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 1><SCENE 5><21%>
	I see you what you are: you are too proud;
	But, if you were the devil, you are fair.
	My lord and master loves you: O! such love
	Could be but recompens'd, though you were crown'd
	The nonpareil of beauty.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 1><SCENE 5><21%>
	With adorations, with fertile tears,
	With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 1><SCENE 5><22%>
	If I did love you in my master's flame,
	With such a suffering, such a deadly life,
	In your denial I would find no sense;
	I would not understand it.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 1><SCENE 5><22%>
	Make me a willow cabin at your gate,
	And call upon my soul within the house;
	Write loyal cantons of contemned love,
	And sing them loud even in the dead of night;
	Holla your name to the reverberate hills,
	And make the babbling gossip of the air
	Cry out, 'Olivia!' O! you should not rest
	Between the elements of air and earth,
	But you should pity me!
<SPEECH 39><ACT 1><SCENE 5><22%>
	Above my fortune, yet my state is well:
	I am a gentleman.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 1><SCENE 5><22%>
	I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:
	My master, not myself, lacks recompense.
	Love make his heart of flint that you shall love,
	And let your fervour, like my master's, be
	Plac'd in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	Even now, sir: on a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	She took the ring of me; I'll none of it.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	I left no ring with her: what means this lady?
	Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!
	She made good view of me; indeed, so much,
	That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,
	For she did speak in starts distractedly.
	She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion
	Invites me in this churlish messenger.
	None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.
	I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,
	Poor lady, she were better love a dream.
	Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,
	Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.
	How easy is it for the proper-false
	In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!
	Alas! our frailty is the cause, not we!
	For such as we are made of, such we be.
	How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly;
	And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;
	And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.
	What will become of this? As I am man,
	My state is desperate for my master's love;
	As I am woman,—now alas the day!—
	What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!
	O time! thou must untangle this, not I;
	It is too hard a knot for me to untie.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
	It gives a very echo to the seat
	Where love is thron'd.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
	A little, by your favour.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
	Of your complexion.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
	About your years, my lord.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
	I think it well, my lord.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
	And so they are: alas, that they are so;
	To die, even when they to perfection grow!
<SPEECH 50><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
	But if she cannot love you, sir?
<SPEECH 51><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
	Sooth, but you must.
	Say that some lady, as perhaps, there is,
	Hath for your love as great a pang of heart
	As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;
	You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?
<SPEECH 52><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
	Ay, but I know,—
<SPEECH 53><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
	Too well what love women to men may owe:
	In faith, they are as true of heart as we.
	My father had a daughter lov'd a man,
	As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,
	I should your lordship.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	A blank, my lord. She never told her love,
	But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,
	Feed on her damask cheek: she pin'd in thought,
	And with a green and yellow melancholy,
	She sat like Patience on a monument,
	Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
	We men may say more, swear more; but indeed
	Our shows are more than will, for still we prove
	Much in our vows, but little in our love.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	I am all the daughters of my father's house,
	And all the brothers too; and yet I know not.
	Sir, shall I to this lady?
<SPEECH 56><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Save thee, friend, and thy music. Dost thou live by thy tabor?
<SPEECH 57><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Art thou a churchman?
<SPEECH 58><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a beggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thy tabor, if thy tabor stand by the church.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Nay, that's certain: they that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton.
<SPEECH 60><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Why, man?
<SPEECH 61><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Thy reason, man?
<SPEECH 62><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	I warrant thou art a merry fellow, and carest for nothing.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?
<SPEECH 64><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.
<SPEECH 65><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee. Hold, there's sixpence for thee.
<SPEECH 66><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for one, though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy lady within?
<SPEECH 67><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	Yes, being kept together and put to use.
<SPEECH 68><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	I understand you, sir; 'tis well begg'd.
<SPEECH 69><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	This fellow's wise enough to play the fool,
	And to do that well craves a kind of wit:
	He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
	The quality of persons, and the time,
	And, like the haggard, check at every feather
	That comes before his eye. This is a practice
	As full of labour as a wise man's art;
	For folly that he wisely shows is fit;
	But wise men folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.
<SPEECH 70><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	And you, sir.
<SPEECH 71><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	Et vous aussi; votre serviteur.
<SPEECH 72><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	I am bound to your niece, sir: I mean, she is the list of my voyage.
<SPEECH 73><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	My legs do better understand me, sir, than I understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.
<SPEECH 74><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we are prevented.
	Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain odours on you!
<SPEECH 75><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	My matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear.
<SPEECH 76><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	My duty, madam, and most humble service.
<SPEECH 77><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.
<SPEECH 78><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:
	Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.
<SPEECH 79><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts
	On his behalf.
<SPEECH 80><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	Dear lady,—
<SPEECH 81><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	I pity you.
<SPEECH 82><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	No, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof
	That very oft we pity enemies.
<SPEECH 83><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	Then westward-ho!
	Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship!
	You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?
<SPEECH 84><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	That you do think you are not what you are.
<SPEECH 85><ACT 3><SCENE 1><53%>
	Then think you right: I am not what I am.
<SPEECH 86><ACT 3><SCENE 1><53%>
	Would it be better, madam, than I am?
	I wish it might, for now I am your fool.
<SPEECH 87><ACT 3><SCENE 1><53%>
	By innocence I swear, and by my youth,
	I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth,
	And that no woman has; nor never none
	Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.
	And so adieu, good madam: never more
	Will I my master's tears to you deplore.
<SPEECH 88><ACT 3><SCENE 4><67%>
	With the same haviour that your passion bears
	Goes on my master's griefs.
<SPEECH 89><ACT 3><SCENE 4><67%>
	Nothing but this; your true love for my master.
<SPEECH 90><ACT 3><SCENE 4><67%>
	I will acquit you.
<SPEECH 91><ACT 3><SCENE 4><67%>
	And you, sir.
<SPEECH 92><ACT 3><SCENE 4><68%>
	You mistake, sir: I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to any man.
<SPEECH 93><ACT 3><SCENE 4><68%>
	I pray you, sir, what is he?
<SPEECH 94><ACT 3><SCENE 4><68%>
	I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady: I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour; belike this is a man of that quirk.
<SPEECH 95><ACT 3><SCENE 4><69%>
	This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me this courteous office, as to know of the knight what my offence to him is: it is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.
<SPEECH 96><ACT 3><SCENE 4><69%>
	Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?
<SPEECH 97><ACT 3><SCENE 4><69%>
	I beseech you, what manner of man is he?
<SPEECH 98><ACT 3><SCENE 4><69%>
	I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one that had rather go with sir priest than sir knight; I care not who knows so much of my mettle.
<SPEECH 99><ACT 3><SCENE 4><71%>
	</STAGE DIR> Pray God defend me! A little thing would make me tell them how much I lack of a man.
<SPEECH 100><ACT 3><SCENE 4><71%>
	I do assure you, 'tis against my will.
<SPEECH 101><ACT 3><SCENE 4><72%>
	</STAGE DIR> Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.
<SPEECH 102><ACT 3><SCENE 4><73%>
	What money, sir?
	For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,
	And part, being prompted by your present trouble,
	Out of my lean and low ability
	I'll lend you something: my having is not much:
	I'll make division of my present with you.
	Hold, there is half my coffer.
<SPEECH 103><ACT 3><SCENE 4><73%>
	I know of none;
	Nor know I you by voice or any feature.
	I hate ingratitude more in a man
	Than lying, vainness, babbling drunkenness,
	Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
	Inhabits our frail blood.
<SPEECH 104><ACT 3><SCENE 4><74%>
	Methinks his words do from such passion fly,
	That he believes himself; so do not I.
	Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,
	That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!
<SPEECH 105><ACT 3><SCENE 4><74%>
	He nam'd Sebastian: I my brother know
	Yet living in my glass; even such and so
	In favour was my brother; and he went

	Tempests are kind, and salt waves fresh in love!
<SPEECH 106><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.
<SPEECH 107><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side;

	I know not what 'twas but distraction.
<SPEECH 108><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	How can this be?
<SPEECH 109><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	Madam!
<SPEECH 110><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.
<SPEECH 111><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly,

<SPEECH 112><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	After him I love
	More than I love these eyes, more than my life,

<SPEECH 115><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	My lord, I do protest,—
<SPEECH 116><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:
	You drew your sword upon me without cause;
	But I bespake you fair, and hurt you not.
