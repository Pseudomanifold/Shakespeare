	My loving lord, Dumaine is mortified:
	The grosser manner of these world's delights
	He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
	To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;
	With all these living in philosophy.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	How follows that?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	In reason nothing.

	Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 3><49%>
	O most divine Kate!

<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 3><50%>
	O! that I had my wish.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 3><50%>
	I would forget her; but a fever she

<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 3><50%>
	Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 3><50%>
	On a day, alack the day!
	Love, whose month is ever May,
	Spied a blossom passing fair
	Playing in the wanton air:
	Through the velvet leaves the wind,
	All unseen, 'gan passage find;
	That the lover, sick to death,
	Wish'd himself the heaven's breath.
	Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow;
	Air, would I might triumph so!
	But alack! my hand is sworn
	Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn:
	Vow, alack! for youth unmeet,
	Youth so apt to pluck a sweet.
	Do not call it sin in me,
	That I am forsworn for thee;
	Thou for whom e'en Jove would swear
	Juno but an Ethiop were;
	And deny himself for Jove,
	Turning mortal for thy love.
	This will I send, and something else more plain,
	That shall express my true love's fasting pain.
	O! would the King, Berowne, and Longaville
	Were lovers too. Ill, to example ill,
	Would from my forehead wipe a perjur'd note;
	For none offend where all alike do dote.
