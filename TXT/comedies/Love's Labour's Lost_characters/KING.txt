	Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
	Live register'd upon our brazen tombs,
	And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
	When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
	The endeavour of this present breath may buy
	That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge,
	And make us heirs of all eternity.
	Therefore, brave conquerors,—for so you are,
	That war against your own affections
	And the huge army of the world's desires,—
	Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
	Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
	Our court shall be a little academe,
	Still and contemplative in living art.
	You three, Berowne, Dumaine, and Longaville,
	Have sworn for three years' term to live with me,
	My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
	That are recorded in this schedule here:
	Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
	That his own hand may strike his honour down
	That violates the smallest branch herein.
	If you are arm'd to do, as sworn to do,
	Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Why, that to know which else we should not know.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Ay, that is study's god-like recompense.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	These be the stops that hinder study quite,
	And train our intellects to vain delight.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	How well he's read, to reason against reading!
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Berowne is like an envious sneaping frost
	That bites the first-born infants of the spring.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Well, sit you out: go home, Berowne: adieu!
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	What say you, lords? why, this was quite forgot.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	We must of force dispense with this decree;
	She must lie here on mere necessity.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
	With a refined traveller of Spain;
	A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
	That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;
	One whom the music of his own vain tongue
	Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;
	A man of complements, whom right and wrong
	Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:
	This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
	For interim to our studies shall relate
	In high-born words the worth of many a knight
	From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
	How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;
	But, I protest, I love to hear him lie,
	And I will use him for my minstrelsy.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	A letter from the magnificent Armado.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	Will you hear this letter with attention?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent, and sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's God, and body's fostering patron,
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	So it is,—
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	Peace!
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	No words!
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	So it is, besieged with sable-coloured melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to walk. The time when? About the sixth hour; when beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down to that nourishment which is called supper: so much for the time when. Now for the ground which; which, I mean, I walked upon: it is ycleped thy park. Then for the place where; where, I mean, I did encounter that most obscene and preposterous event, that draweth from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest. But to the place where, it standeth north-north-east and by east from the west corner of thy curious-knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited swain, that base minnow of thy mirth,—
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	that unlettered small-knowing soul,—
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	that shallow vessel,—
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	which, as I remember, hight Costard,—
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	sorted and consorted, contrary to thy established proclaimed edict and continent canon, with—with,—O! with but with this I passion to say wherewith,—
<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	with a child of our grandmother Eve, a female; or, for thy more sweet understanding, a woman. Him, I,—as my everesteemed duty pricks me on,—have sent to thee, to receive the meed of punishment, by thy sweet Grace's officer, Antony Dull; a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and estimation.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	For Jaquenetta,—so is the weaker vessel called which I apprehended with the aforesaid swain,—I keep her as a vessel of thy law's fury; and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted and heart-burning heat of duty,
<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say you to this?
<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	Did you hear the proclamation?
<SPEECH 28><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken with a wench.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	Well, it was proclaimed 'damosel.'
<SPEECH 30><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	It is so varied too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'
<SPEECH 31><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	This maid will not serve your turn, sir.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast a week with bran and water.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
	My Lord Berowne, see him deliver'd o'er:
	And go we, lords, to put in practice that
	Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
	Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
	You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
	Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
	Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
	Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
	Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
	Madam, your father here doth intimate
	The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
	Being but the one half of an entire sum
	Disbursed by my father in his wars.
	But say that he, or we,—as neither have,—
	Receiv'd that sum, yet there remains unpaid
	A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,
	One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
	Although not valu'd to the money's worth.
	If then the king your father will restore
	But that one half which is unsatisfied,
	We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
	And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
	But that it seems, he little purposeth,
	For here he doth demand to have repaid
	A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
	On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
	To have his title live in Aquitaine;
	Which we much rather had depart withal,
	And have the money by our father lent,
	Than Aquitaine, so gelded as it is.
	Dear princess, were not his requests so far
	From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
	A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast,
	And go well satisfied to France again.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	I do protest I never heard of it;
	And if you prove it, I'll repay it back
	Or yield up Aquitaine.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Satisfy me so.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	It shall suffice me: at which interview
	All liberal reason I will yield unto.
	Meantime, receive such welcome at my hand
	As honour, without breach of honour, may
	Make tender of to thy true worthiness.
	You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;
	But here without you shall be so receiv'd,
	As you shall deem yourself lodg'd in my heart,
	Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
	Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:
	To-morrow shall we visit you again.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!
<SPEECH 45><ACT 4><SCENE 3><47%>
	Ah me!
<SPEECH 46><ACT 4><SCENE 3><47%>
	So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
	To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,
	As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote
	The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows:
	Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
	Through the transparent bosom of the deep,
	As doth thy face through tears of mine give light,
	Thou shin'st in every tear that I do weep.
	No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
	So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
	Do but behold the tears that swell in me,
	And they thy glory through my grief will show
	But do not love thyself, then thou wilt keep
	My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.
	O queen of queens! how far thou dost excel,
	No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell
	How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper:
	Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?
	What, Longaville! and reading! listen, ear.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 4><SCENE 3><48%>
	In love, I hope: sweet fellowship in shame!
<SPEECH 48><ACT 4><SCENE 3><50%>
	And I mine too, good Lord!
<SPEECH 49><ACT 4><SCENE 3><51%>
	</STAGE DIR> Come, sir, you blush: as his your case is such;
	You chide at him, offending twice as much:
	You do not love Maria; Longaville
	Did never sonnet for her sake compile,
	Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
	His loving bosom to keep down his heart.
	I have been closely shrouded in this bush,
	And mark'd you both, and for you both did blush.
	I heard your guilty rimes, observ'd your fashion,
	Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion:
	Ay me! says one; O Jove! the other cries;
	One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other's eyes:
	</STAGE DIR> You would for paradise break faith and troth;
	</STAGE DIR> And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.
	What will Berowne say, when that he shall hear
	A faith infringed, which such zeal did swear?
	How will he scorn! how will he spend his wit!
	How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!
	For all the wealth that ever I did see,
	I would not have him know so much by me.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 4><SCENE 3><52%>
	Too bitter is thy jest.
	Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?
<SPEECH 51><ACT 4><SCENE 3><53%>
	Soft! Whither away so fast? true man or a thief that gallops so?
<SPEECH 52><ACT 4><SCENE 3><53%>
	What present hast thou there?
<SPEECH 53><ACT 4><SCENE 3><53%>
	What makes treason here?

	If it mar nothing neither,

	Berowne, read it over—

	Where hadst thou it?

	What?

	Hence, sirs; away!
<SPEECH 60><ACT 4><SCENE 3><54%>
	What! did these rent lines show some love of thine?
<SPEECH 61><ACT 4><SCENE 3><55%>
	What zeal, what fury hath inspir'd thee now?

	By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 4><SCENE 3><56%>
	O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,

	And Ethiops of their sweet complexion crack.
<SPEECH 65><ACT 4><SCENE 3><56%>
	'Twere good yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,

<SPEECH 67><ACT 4><SCENE 3><57%>
	But what of this? Are we not all in love?
<SPEECH 68><ACT 4><SCENE 3><57%>
	Then leave this chat; and good Berowne, now prove

	Say to her, we have measur'd many miles,

<SPEECH 74><ACT 5><SCENE 2><73%>
	Then, in our measure but vouchsafe one change.
	Thou bid'st me beg; this begging is not strange.
<SPEECH 75><ACT 5><SCENE 2><74%>
	Will you not dance? How come you thus estrang'd?
<SPEECH 76><ACT 5><SCENE 2><74%>
	Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.
	The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.
<SPEECH 77><ACT 5><SCENE 2><74%>
	But your legs should do it.
<SPEECH 78><ACT 5><SCENE 2><74%>
	Why take we hands then?
<SPEECH 79><ACT 5><SCENE 2><74%>
	More measure of this measure: be not nice.
<SPEECH 80><ACT 5><SCENE 2><74%>
	Prize you yourselves? what buys your company?
<SPEECH 81><ACT 5><SCENE 2><74%>
	That can never be.
<SPEECH 82><ACT 5><SCENE 2><74%>
	If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.
<SPEECH 83><ACT 5><SCENE 2><74%>
	I am best pleas'd with that.
<SPEECH 84><ACT 5><SCENE 2><76%>
	Farewell, mad wenches: you have simple wits.

	Fair sir, God save you! Where is the princess?
<SPEECH 86><ACT 5><SCENE 2><78%>
	That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.
<SPEECH 87><ACT 5><SCENE 2><79%>
	A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,

	All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!
<SPEECH 89><ACT 5><SCENE 2><79%>
	Construe my speeches better, if you may.
<SPEECH 90><ACT 5><SCENE 2><79%>
	We came to visit you, and purpose now

<SPEECH 91><ACT 5><SCENE 2><79%>
	Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
	The virtue of your eye must break my oath.
<SPEECH 92><ACT 5><SCENE 2><80%>
	O! you have liv'd in desolation here,
	Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.

	I was, fair madam.

	Upon mine honour, no.

	Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies. He presents Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey the Great; the parish curate, Alexander; Armado's page, Hercules; the pedant, Judas Maccabæus:

	These four will change habits and present the other five.

	The extreme part of time extremely forms
	All causes to the purpose of his speed,
	And often, at his very loose, decides
	That which long process could not arbitrate:
	And though the mourning brow of progeny
	Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
	The holy suit which fain it would convince;
	Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
	Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
	From what it purpos'd; since, to wail friends lost
	Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
	As to rejoice at friends but newly found.
<SPEECH 113><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
	Grant us your loves.

	If this, or more than this, I would deny,

	Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.
<SPEECH 115><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
	No, madam; we will bring you on your way.
<SPEECH 116><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
	Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,
	And then 'twill end.
<SPEECH 117><ACT 5><SCENE 2><99%>
	Call them forth quickly; we will do so.
