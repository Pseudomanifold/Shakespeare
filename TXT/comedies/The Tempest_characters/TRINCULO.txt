	Here's neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all, and another storm brewing; I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls.—What have we here? a man or a fish? Dead or alive? A fish: he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,—as once I was,—and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver: there would this monster make a man; any strange beast there makes a man. When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg'd like a man! and his fins like arms! Warm, o' my troth! I do now let loose my opinion, hold it no longer; this is no fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Alas! the storm is come again: my best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no other shelter hereabout: misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows. I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.

	I should know that voice: it should be—but he is drowned, and these are devils. O! defend me.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 2><48%>
	Stephano!
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 2><48%>
	Stephano!—if thou beest Stephano, touch me, and speak to me; for I am Trinculo:—be not afeard—thy good friend Trinculo.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 2><49%>
	I took him to be killed with a thunderstroke. But art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me under the dead mooncalf's gaberdine for fear of the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O Stephano! two Neapolitans 'scaped!
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 2><50%>
	Swam ashore, man, like a duck: I can swim like a duck, I'll be sworn.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 2><50%>
	O Stephano! hast any more of this?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><50%>
	By this good light, this is a very shallow monster.—I afeard of him!—a very weak monster.—The man i' the moon! a most poor credulous monster!—Well drawn, monster, in good sooth.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><51%>
	By this light, a most perfidious and drunken monster: when his god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 2><51%>
	I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my heart to beat him,—
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 2><51%>
	But that the poor monster's in drink: an abominable monster!
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 2><51%>
	A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a poor drunkard!
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 2><52%>
	A howling monster, a drunken monster.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They say there's but five upon this isle: we are three of them; if th' other two be brained like us, the state totters.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	Where should they be set else? he were a brave monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	Nor go neither: but you'll lie, like dogs; and yet say nothing neither.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	Thou hest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou, was there ever a man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a monster?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	'Lord' quoth he!—that a monster should be such a natural!
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
	Why, I said nothing.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 2><60%>
	Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go further off.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 2><61%>
	I did not give thee the he:—Out o' your wits and hearing too?—A pox o' your bottle! this can sack and drinking do.—A murrain on your monster, and the devil take your fingers!
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 2><62%>
	Excellent.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 2><63%>
	This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture of Nobody.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 2><63%>
	O, forgive me my sins!
<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 2><64%>
	The sound is going away: let's follow it, and after do our work.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 2><64%>
	I'll follow, Stephano.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 1><80%>
	Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at which my nose is in great indignation.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 1><80%>
	Thou wert but a lost monster.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 1><81%>
	Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,—
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 1><81%>
	That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your harmless fairy, monster.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 1><81%>
	O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look, what a wardrobe here is for thee!
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 1><81%>
	O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery.—O king Stephano!
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 1><81%>
	Thy grace shall have it.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 1><82%>
	Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 1><82%>
	Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and away with the rest.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 1><82%>
	And this.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
	If these be true spies which I wear in my head, here's a goodly sight.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
	I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.
