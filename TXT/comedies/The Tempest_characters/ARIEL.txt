	All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
	To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
	To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
	On the curl'd clouds: to thy strong bidding task
	Ariel and all his quality.

	To every article.
	I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
	Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
	I flam'd amazement: sometime I'd divide
	And burn in many places; on the topmast,
	The yards, and boresprit, would I flame distinctly,
	Then meet, and join: Jove's lightnings, the precursors
	O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
	And sight-outrunning were not: the fire and cracks
	Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
	Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
	Yea, his dread trident shake.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><14%>
	Not a soul
	But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
	Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners,
	Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
	Then all a-fire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
	With hair up-staring,—then like reeds, not hair,—
	Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty,
	And all the devils are here.'
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><14%>
	Close by, my master.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><14%>
	Not a hair perish'd;
	On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
	But fresher than before: and, as thou bad'st me,
	In troops I have dispers'd them 'bout the isle.
	The king's son have I landed by himself;
	Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
	In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
	His arms in this sad knot.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><15%>
	Safely in harbour
	Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
	Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
	From the still-vex'd Bermoothes; there she's hid:
	The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
	Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
	I have left asleep: and for the rest o' the fleet
	Which I dispers'd, they all have met again,
	And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
	Bound sadly home for Naples,
	Supposing that they saw the king's ship wrack'd,
	And his great person perish.

	I prithee

<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 2><16%>
	No.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 2><16%>

	You are three men of sin, whom Destiny—
	That hath to instrument this lower world
	And what is in't,—the never-surfeited sea
	Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island
	Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men
	Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;
	And even with such-like valour men hang and drown
	Their proper selves. You fools! I and my fellows
	Are ministers of fate: the elements
	Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well
	Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs
	Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
	One dowle that's in my plume; my fellow-ministers
	Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
	Your swords are now too massy for your strengths,
	And will not be uplifted. But, remember,—
	For that's my business to you,—that you three
	From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
	Expos'd unto the sea, which hath requit it,
	Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed
	The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
	Incens'd the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
	Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
	They have bereft; and do pronounce, by me,
	Lingering perdition,—worse than any death
	Can be at once,—shall step by step attend
	You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from—
	Which here in this most desolate isle, else falls
	Upon your heads,—is nothing but heart-sorrow
	And a clear life ensuing.

	Presently?

	Before you can say, 'Come,' and 'Go,'

<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 1><73%>
	Well, I conceive.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 1><78%>
	Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 1><78%>
	Ay, my commander; when I presented Ceres,

	I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;
	So full of valour that they smote the air
	For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
	For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
	Towards their project. Then I beat my tabor;
	At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd their ears,
	Advanc'd their eyelids, lifted up their noses
	As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears
	That, calf-like, they my lowing follow'd through
	Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,
	Which enter'd their frail shins: at last I left them
	I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,
	There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake
	O'erstunk their feet.

	Confin'd together
	In the same fashion as you gave in charge,
	Just as you left them: all prisoners, sir,
	In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;
	They cannot budge till your release. The king,
	His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,
	And the remainder mourning over them,
	Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly
	Him, that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo:'
	His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
	From eaves of reeds; your charm so strongly works them,
	That if you now beheld them, your affections
	Would become tender.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>

	Under the blossom that hangs on the bough
<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
