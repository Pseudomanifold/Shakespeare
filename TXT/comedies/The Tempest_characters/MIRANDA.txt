	If by your art, my dearest father, you have
	Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
	The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
	But that the sea, mounting to th' welkin's cheek,
	Dashes the fire out. O! I have suffer'd
	With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
	Who had, no doubt, some noble creatures in her,
	Dash'd all to pieces. O! the cry did knock
	Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
	Had I been any god of power, I would
	Have sunk the sea within the earth, or e'er
	It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
	The fraughting souls within her.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><5%>
	O, woe the day!
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><5%>
	More to know
	Did never meddle with my thoughts.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><6%>
	You have often
	Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd,
	And left me to a bootless inquisition,
	Concluding, 'Stay; not yet.'
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><6%>
	Certainly, sir, I can.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 2><6%>
	'Tis far off;
	And rather like a dream than an assurance
	That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
	Four or five women once that tended me?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	But that I do not.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	Sir, are not you my father?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	O, the heavens!
	What foul play had we that we came from thence?
	Or blessed was't we did?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
	O! my heart bleeds
	To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,
	Which is from my remembrance. Please you, further.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	Sir, most heedfully.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	O, good sir! I do.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	O the heavens!
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	I should sin
	To think but nobly of my grandmother:
	Good wombs have borne bad sons.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	Alack, for pity!
	I, not rememb'ring how I cried out then,
	Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint,
	That wrings mine eyes to 't.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	Wherefore did they not
	That hour destroy us?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	Alack! what trouble
	Was I then to you!
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	How came we ashore?
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	Would I might
	But ever see that man!
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,—
	For still 'tis beating in my mind,—your reason
	For raising this sea-storm?
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 2><19%>
	</STAGE DIR> The strangeness of your story put
	Heaviness in me.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 2><19%>
	'Tis a villain, sir,
	I do not love to look on.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 2><24%>
	What is't? a spirit?
	Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
	It carries a brave form:—but 'tis a spirit.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 2><24%>
	I might call him
	A thing divine; for nothing natural
	I ever saw so noble.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 2><24%>
	No wonder, sir;
	But certainly a maid.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 1><SCENE 2><25%>
	Alack, for mercy!
<SPEECH 29><ACT 1><SCENE 2><25%>
	</STAGE DIR> Why speaks my father so ungently? This
	Is the third man that e'er I saw; the first
	That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
	To be inclin'd my way!
<SPEECH 30><ACT 1><SCENE 2><26%>
	There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
	If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
	Good things will strive to dwell with't.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 1><SCENE 2><27%>
	O dear father!
	Make not too rash a trial of him, for
	He's gentle, and not fearful.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 1><SCENE 2><27%>
	Beseech you, father!
<SPEECH 33><ACT 1><SCENE 2><27%>
	Sir, have pity:
	I'll be his surety.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 1><SCENE 2><27%>
	My affections
	Are then most humble; I have no ambition
	To see a goodlier man.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 1><SCENE 2><28%>
	Be of comfort;
	My father's of a better nature, sir,
	Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted,
	Which now came from him.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 3><SCENE 1><53%>
	Alas! now, pray you,
	Work not so hard: I would the lightning had
	Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!
	Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,
	'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
	Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself:
	He's safe for these three hours.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 3><SCENE 1><53%>
	If you'll sit down,
	I'll bear your logs the while. Pray, give me that;
	I'll carry it to the pile.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 1><54%>
	It would become me
	As well as it does you: and I should do it
	With much more ease; for my good will is to it,
	And yours it is against.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 1><54%>
	You look wearily.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 1><54%>
	Miranda.—O my father!
	I have broke your hest to say so.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
	I do not know
	One of my sex; no woman's face remember,
	Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen
	More that I may call men than you, good friend,
	And my dear father: how features are abroad,
	I am skill-less of; but, by my modesty,—
	The jewel in my dower,—I would not wish
	Any companion in the world but you;
	Nor can imagination form a shape,
	Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
	Something too wildly and my father's precepts
	I therein do forget.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
	Do you love me?
<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
	I am a fool
	To weep at what I am glad of.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
	At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer
	What I desire to give; and much less take
	What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;
	And all the more it seeks to hide itself
	The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!
	And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
	I am your wife, if you will marry me;
	If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow
	You may deny me; but I'll be your servant
	Whether you will or no.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
	My husband then?
<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 1><57%>
	And mine, with my heart in't: and now farewell
	Till half an hour hence.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 4><SCENE 1><77%>
	Never till this day
	Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	Sweet lord, you play me false.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,
	And I would call it fair play.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	O, wonder!
	How many goodly creatures are there here!
	How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,
	That has such people in't!
