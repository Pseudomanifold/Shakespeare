	I must eat my dinner.
	This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
	Which thou tak'st from me. When thou camest first,
	Thou strok'dst me, and mad'st much of me; wouldst give me
	Water with berries in't; and teach me how
	To name the bigger light, and how the less,
	That burn by day and night: and then I lov'd thee
	And show'd thee all the qualities o' th' isle,
	The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place, and fertile.
	Cursed be I that did so!—All the charms
	Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
	For I am all the subjects that you have,
	Which first was mine own king; and here you sty me
	In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
	The rest o' th' island.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><21%>
	Oh ho! Oh ho!—would it had been done!
	Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
	This isle with Calibans.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><21%>
	You taught me language: and my profit on't

	No, pray thee!—
	</STAGE DIR> I must obey: his art is of such power,

	All the infections that the sun sucks up
	From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall, and make him
	By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me,
	And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,
	Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i' the mire,
	Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
	Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
	For every trifle are they set upon me:
	Sometime like apes, that mow and chatter at me
	And after bite me; then like hedge-hogs, which
	Lie tumbling in my bare-foot way and mount
	Their pricks at my foot-fall; sometime am I
	All wound with adders, who with cloven tongues
	Do hiss me into madness.—
	Lo now! lo!
	Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me
	For bringing wood in slowly: I'll fall flat;
	Perchance he will not mind me.

	Thou wondrous man.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 2><51%>
	I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;
	And I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts;

	To clust'ring filberts, and sometimes I'll get thee
	Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?

	I say, by sorcery he got this isle;
	From me he got it: if thy greatness will,

	But this thing dare not,—
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 2><60%>
	Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 2><60%>
	Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,
	Where thou may'st knock a nail into his head.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 2><60%>
	What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!—
	I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows,
	And take his bottle from him: when that's gone
	He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him
	Where the quick freshes are.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 2><61%>
	Ha, ha, ha!
<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 2><61%>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 2><61%>
	Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him
	I' the afternoon to sleep: there thou may'st brain him,
	Having first seiz'd his books; or with a log
	Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
	Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
	First to possess his books; for without them
	He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not
	One spirit to command: they all do hate him
	As rootedly as I. Burn but his books;
	He has brave utensils,—for so he calls them,—
	Which, when he has a house, he'll deck withal:
	And that most deeply to consider is
	The beauty of his daughter; he himself
	Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,
	But only Sycorax my dam and she;
	But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
	As great'st does least.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 3><SCENE 2><62%>
	Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant,
	And bring thee forth brave brood.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 3><SCENE 2><62%>
	Within this half hour will he be asleep;
	Wilt thou destroy him then?
<SPEECH 37><ACT 3><SCENE 2><62%>
	Thou mak'st me merry: I am full of pleasure.
	Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
	You taught me but while-ere?
<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 2><63%>
	That's not the tune.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 2><63%>
	Art thou afeard?
<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 2><63%>
	Be not afeard: the isle is full of noises,
	Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.
	Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
	Will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices,
	That, if I then had wak'd after long sleep,
	Will make mesleep again: and then, in dreaming,
	The clouds methought would open and show riches
	Ready to drop upon me; that, when I wak'd
	I cried to dream again.

	Good my lord, give me thy favour still:
	Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to

	Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,
	This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.

	Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,
	For aye thy foot-licker.

	Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.

	Make us strange stuff.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 4><SCENE 1><82%>
	I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,
	And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes
