	Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er
	Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;
	Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers
	Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers:
	And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
	My bosky acres, and my unshrubb'd down,
	Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
	Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 1><74%>
	Tell me, heavenly bow,
	If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,
	Do now attend the queen? since they did plot
	The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,
	Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company
	I have forsworn.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 1><75%>
	Highest queen of state,
	Great Juno comes; I know her by her gait.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 1><75%>
	Earth's increase, foison plenty,
	Barns and garners never empty:
	Vines, with clust'ring bunches growing;
	Plants with goodly burden bowing;
	Spring come to you at the farthest
	In the very end of harvest!
	Scarcity and want shall shun you;
	Ceres' blessing so is on you.
