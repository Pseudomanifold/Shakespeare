	A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	I am out of patience.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Let's take leave of him.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
	He receives comfort like cold porridge.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
	Look, he's winding up the watch of his wit; by and by it will strike.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
	One: tell.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
	A dollar.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
	You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
	He will be talking.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
	The old cock.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
	Done. The wager?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
	A match!
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
	Ha, ha, ha! So you're paid.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
	Yet—
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
	Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
	As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 1><31%>
	Of that there's none, or little.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 1><31%>
	With an eye of green in't.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 1><31%>
	No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 1><31%>
	As many vouch'd rarities are.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 1><31%>
	Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 1><31%>
	'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 1><32%>
	What if he had said, widower Æneas too? Good Lord, how you take it!
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 1><32%>
	He hath rais'd the wall, and houses too.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 1><32%>
	I think he will carry this island home in his pocket, and give it his son for an apple.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>
	Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 1><34%>
	Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
	That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
	But rather lose her to an African;
	Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
	Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 1><34%>
	You were kneel'd to and importun'd otherwise
	By all of us; and the fair soul herself
	Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
	Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your son,
	I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
	More widows in them of this business' making,
	Than we bring men to comfort them: the fault's
	Your own.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 1><34%>
	Very well.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 1><34%>
	Foul weather?
<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 1><35%>
	Or docks, or mallows.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 1><35%>
	'Scape being drunk for want of wine.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 1><35%>
	Yet he would be king on't.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 1><35%>
	No marrying 'mong his subjects?
<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 1><36%>
	Save his majesty!
<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 1><36%>
	An it had not fallen flat-long.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 1><36%>
	We would so, and then go a-bat-fowling.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 1><37%>
	Please you, sir,
	Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
	It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth
	It is a comforter.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 1><37%>
	What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
<SPEECH 40><ACT 2><SCENE 1><37%>
	Why
	Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
	Myself dispos'd to sleep.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 1><38%>
	What! art thou waking?
<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 1><38%>
	I do; and surely,
	It is a sleepy language, and thou speak'st
	Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
	This is a strange repose, to be asleep
	With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,
	And yet so fast asleep.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 2><SCENE 1><38%>
	Thou dost snore distinctly:
	There's meaning in thy snores.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 2><SCENE 1><38%>
	Well; I am standing water.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 2><SCENE 1><38%>
	Do so: to ebb,
	Hereditary sloth instructs me.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 2><SCENE 1><39%>
	Prithee, say on:
	The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
	A matter from thee, and a birth indeed
	Which throes thee much to yield.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 2><SCENE 1><39%>
	I have no hope
	That he's undrown'd.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 2><SCENE 1><39%>
	He's gone.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 2><SCENE 1><39%>
	Claribel.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 2><SCENE 1><40%>
	What stuff is this!—How say you?
	'Tis true my brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis;
	So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions
	There is some space.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 2><SCENE 1><40%>
	Methinks I do.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 2><SCENE 1><41%>
	I remember
	You did supplant your brother Prospero.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 2><SCENE 1><41%>
	But, for your conscience,—
<SPEECH 54><ACT 2><SCENE 1><41%>
	Thy case, dear friend,
	Shall be my precedent: as thou got'st Milan,
	I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke
	Shall free thee from the tribute which thou pay'st,
	And I the king shall love thee.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 2><SCENE 1><42%>
	O! but one word.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 2><SCENE 1><42%>
	Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
	Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
	Like bulls, or rather hons; did't not wake you?
	It struck mine ear most terribly.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 3><SCENE 3><65%>
	</STAGE DIR> The next advantage
	Will we take throughly.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 3><SCENE 3><65%>
	</STAGE DIR> I say to-night: no more.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 3><SCENE 3><65%>
	A living drollery. Now I will believe
	That there are unicorns; that in Arabia
	There is one tree, the phœnix' throne; one phœnix
	At this hour reigning there.
<SPEECH 60><ACT 3><SCENE 3><66%>
	No matter, since
	They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.—
	Will't please you to taste of what is here?
<SPEECH 61><ACT 3><SCENE 3><70%>
	But one fiend at a time,
	I'll fight their legions o'er.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	</STAGE DIR> The devil speaks in him.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	A most high miracle!
<SPEECH 64><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
	Ha, ha!
	What things are these, my lord Antonio?
	Will money buy them?
<SPEECH 65><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
	He is drunk now: where had he wine?
<SPEECH 66><ACT 5><SCENE 1><98%>
	Why, how now, Stephano!
<SPEECH 67><ACT 5><SCENE 1><98%>
	Or stole it, rather.
