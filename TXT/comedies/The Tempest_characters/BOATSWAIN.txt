	Here, master: what cheer?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the master's whistle.—Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!

	I pray now, keep below.

	Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your cabins: you do assist the storm.

	When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	None that I more love than myself. You are a counsellor: if you can command these elements to silence, and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap.—Cheerly, good hearts!—Out of our way, I say.

	Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring her to try with main-course. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> A plague upon this howling! they are louder than the weather, or our office.—
	Yet again? what do you here? Shall we give o'er, and drown? Have you a mind to sink?

	Work you, then.

	Lay her a-hold, a-hold! Set her two courses; off to sea again; lay her off.

	What, must our mouths be cold?

	The best news is that we have safely found
	Our king and company: the next, our ship,—
	Which but three glasses since we gave out split,—
	Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when
	We first put out to sea.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 1><95%>
	If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
	I'd strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,
	And,—how we know not,—all clapp'd under hatches,
	Where, but even now, with strange and several noises
	Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
	And mo diversity of sounds, all horrible,
	We were awak'd; straightway, at liberty:
	Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
	Our royal, good, and gallant ship; our master
	Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,
	Even in a dream, were we divided from them,
	And were brought moping hither.
