	Thersites!

	Dog!
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Thou bitch-wolf's son, canst thou not hear?
	Feel, then.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Speak then, thou vinewedst leaven, speak: I will beat thee into handsomeness.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	The proclamation!
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Do not, porpentine, do not: my fingers itch.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	I say, the proclamation!
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Mistress Thersites!
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Cobloaf!
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	You whoreson cur.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	Thou stool for a witch!
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	You dog!
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	You cur!
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	Therefore I beat thee.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	O thou damned cur! I shall—
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenour of the proclamation, and he rails upon me.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	Well, go to, go to.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	I shall cut out your tongue.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	Farewell. Who shall answer him?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	O, meaning you. I will go learn more of it.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart: you may call it melancholy if you will favour the man; but, by my head, 'tis pride: but why, why? let him show us a cause. A word, my lord.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	What is he more than another?
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a better man than I am?
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I know not what pride is.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering of toads.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
	If I go to him, with my armed fist
	I'll pash him o'er the face.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
	An a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride.
	Let me go to him.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
	A paltry, insolent fellow!
<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
	Can he not be sociable?
<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
	I'll let his humours blood.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
	An all men were o' my mind,—
<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
	A' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first: shall pride carry it?
<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
	I will knead him; I will make him supple.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
	A whoreson dog, that shall palter thus with us! Would he were a Trojan!
<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
	Shall I call you father?
<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 3><53%>
	How now, Patroclus?
<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 3><53%>
	Ha?
<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 3><53%>
	Ay, and good next day too.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 4><SCENE 5><70%>
	Thou, trumpet, there's my purse.
	Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:
	Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek
	Outswell the colic of puff'd Aquilon.
	Come, stretch thy chest, and let thy eyes spout blood;
	Thou blow'st for Hector.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
	I am not warm yet; let us fight again.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 4><SCENE 5><75%>
	I thank thee, Hector:
	Thou art too gentle and too free a man:
	I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
	A great addition earned in thy death.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 4><SCENE 5><75%>
	If I might in entreaties find success,—
	As seld I have the chance,—I would desire
	My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 4><SCENE 5><75%>
	Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 4><SCENE 5><78%>
	Do not chafe thee, cousin:
	And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,
	Till accident or purpose bring you to't:
	You may have every day enough of Hector,
	If you have stomach. The general state, I fear,
	Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
	No, yonder 'tis;
	There, where we see the lights.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
	No, not a whit.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 5><SCENE 5><94%>
	Troilus! thou coward Troilus!
<SPEECH 51><ACT 5><SCENE 6><95%>
	Troilus, thou coward Troilus, show thy head!
<SPEECH 52><ACT 5><SCENE 6><95%>
	What wouldst thou?
<SPEECH 53><ACT 5><SCENE 6><95%>
	Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office
	Ere that correction. Troilus, I say! what, Troilus!
<SPEECH 54><ACT 5><SCENE 6><95%>
	I'll fight with him alone: stand, Diomed.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 5><SCENE 1><98%>
	If it be so, yet bragless let it be;
	Great Hector was a man as good as he.
