	Ay, sir, when he goes before me.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	Sir, I do depend upon the Lord.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	The Lord be praised!
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	Faith, sir, superficially.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	I hope I shall know your honour better.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	You are in the state of grace.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	I do but partly know, sir: it is music in parts.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	Wholly, sir.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	To the hearers, sir.

<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	That's to't, indeed, sir. Marry, sir, at the request of Paris my lord, who is there in person; with him the mortal Venus, the heartblood of beauty, love's invisible soul.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	No, sir, Helen: could you not find out that by her attributes?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	Sodden business: there's a stewed phrase, indeed.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 5><93%>
	I go, my lord.
