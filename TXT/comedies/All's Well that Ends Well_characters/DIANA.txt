	They say the French Count has done most honourable service.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>
	You shall not need to fear me.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 5><54%>
	The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 5><54%>
	Whatsoe'er he is,
	He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,
	As 'tis reported, for the king had married him
	Against his liking. Think you it is so?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 5><54%>
	There is a gentleman that serves the count
	Reports but coarsely of her.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 5><54%>
	Monsieur Parolles.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 5><54%>
	Alas, poor lady!
	'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
	Of a detesting lord.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 5><55%>
	He;
	That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow;
	I would he lov'd his wife. If he were honester,
	He were much goodlier; is't not a handsome gentleman?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 5><55%>
	'Tis pity he is not honest. Yond's that same knave
	That leads him to these places: were I his lady
	I would poison that vile rascal.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 5><55%>
	That jack-an-apes with scarfs. Why is he melancholy?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	No, my good lord, Diana.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	She then was honest.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	No:
	My mother did but duty; such, my lord,
	As you owe to your wife.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Ay, so you serve us
	Till we serve you; but when you have our roses,
	You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
	And mock us with our bareness.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	'Tis not the many oaths that make the truth,
	But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.
	What is not holy, that we swear not by,
	But take the Highest to witness: then, pray you, tell me,
	If I should swear by God's great attributes
	I lov'd you dearly, would you believe my oaths,
	When I did love you ill? this has no holding,
	To swear by him whom I protest to love,
	That I will work against him: therefore your oaths
	Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd;
	At least in my opinion.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	I see that men make ropes in such a scarr
	That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	Will you not, my lord?
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	Mine honour's such a ring:
	My chastity's the jewel of our house,
	Bequeathed down from many ancestors,
	Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
	In me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom
	Brings in the champion honour on my part
	Against your vain assault.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:
	I'll order take my mother shall not hear.
	Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
	When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,
	Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me.
	My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them
	When back again this ring shall be deliver'd:
	And on your finger in the night I'll put
	Another ring, that what in time proceeds
	May token to the future our past deeds.
	Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have won
	A wife of me, though there my hope be done.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
	You may so in the end.
	My mother told me just how he would woo
	As if she sat in 's heart; she says all men
	Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me
	When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him
	When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,
	Marry that will, I live and die a maid:
	Only in this disguise I think't no sin
	To cozen him that would unjustly win.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>
	Let death and honesty
	Go with your impositions, I am yours
	Upon your will to suffer.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
	I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,
	Derived from the ancient Capilet:
	My suit, as I do understand, you know,
	And therefore know how far I may be pitied.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
	Why do you look so strange upon your wife?
<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
	If you shall marry,
	You give away this hand, and that is mine;
	You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;
	You give away myself, which is known mine;
	For I by vow am so embodied yours
	That she which marries you must marry me;
	Either both or none.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
	Good my lord,
	Ask him upon his oath, if he does think
	He had not my virginity.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 5><SCENE 3><95%>
	He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,
	He might have bought me at a common price:
	Do not believe him. O! behold this ring,
	Whose high respect and rich validity
	Did lack a parallel; yet for all that
	He gave it to a commoner o' the camp,
	If I be one.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 3><95%>
	I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
	So bad an instrument: his name's Parolles.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
	I must be patient;
	You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,
	May justly diet me. I pray you yet,—
	Since you lack virtue I will lose a husband,—
	Send for your ring; I will return it home,
	And give me mine again.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
	Sir, much like
	The same upon your finger.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
	And this was it I gave him, being a-bed.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
	I have spoke the truth.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
	Ay, my lord.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	Do you know he promised me marriage?
<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	Ay, my good lord.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	It was not lent me neither.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	I found it not.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
	I never gave it him.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
	It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
	I'll never tell you.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
	I'll put in bail, my liege.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
	By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
	Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty.
	He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;
	I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
	Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;
	I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
	Good mother, fetch my bail. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Stay, royal sir;
	The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
	And he shall surety me. But for this lord,
	Who hath abus'd me, as he knows himself,
	Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:
	He knows himself my bed he hath defil'd,
	And at that time he got his wife with child:
	Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
	So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick;
	And now behold the meaning.
