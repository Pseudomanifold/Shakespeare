	The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;
	Have fought with equal fortune, and continue
	A braving war.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	Nay, 'tis most credible: we here receive it
	A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
	With caution that the Florentine will move us
	For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
	Prejudicates the business, and would seem
	To have us make denial.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	He hath arm'd our answer,
	And Florence is denied before he comes:
	Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see
	The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
	To stand on either part.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	What's he comes here?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
	Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
	Hath well compos'd thee. Thy father's moral parts
	Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	I would I had that corporal soundness now,
	As when thy father and myself in friendship
	First tried our soldiership! He did look far
	Into the service of the time and was
	Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;
	But on us both did haggish age steal on,
	And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
	To talk of your good father. In his youth
	He had the wit which I can well observe
	To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
	Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
	Ere they can hide their levity in honour.
	So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness
	Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
	His equal had awak'd them; and his honour,
	Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
	Exception bid him speak, and at this time
	His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him
	He us'd as creatures of another place,
	And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
	Making them proud of his humility,
	In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
	Might be a copy to these younger times,
	Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now
	But goers backward.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	Would I were with him! He would always say,—
	Methinks I hear him now: his plausive words
	He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,
	To grow there and to bear. 'Let me not live,'—
	Thus his good melancholy oft began,
	On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
	When it was out,—'Let me not live,' quoth he,
	'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
	Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
	All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
	Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
	Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd:
	I, after him, do after him wish too,
	Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
	I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
	To give some labourers room.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,
	Since the physician at your father's died?
	He was much fam'd.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	If he were living, I would try him yet:
	Lend me an arm: the rest have worn me out
	With several applications: nature and sickness
	Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;
	My son's no dearer.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><19%>
	Farewell, young lords: these war-like principles
	Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell:
	Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all
	The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis receiv'd,
	And is enough for both.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
	No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
	Will not confess he owes the malady
	That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;
	Whether I live or die, be you the sons
	Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy—
	Those bated that inherit but the fall
	Of the last monarchy—see that you come
	Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
	The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek
	That fame may cry you loud: I say, farewell.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
	Those girls of Italy, take heed of them:
	They say, our French lack language to deny
	If they demand: beware of being captives,
	Before you serve.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
	Farewell. Come hither to me.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	I'll fee thee to stand up.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,

<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	No.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	What 'her' is this?
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Now, good Lafeu,
	Bring in the admiration, that we with thee
	May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
	By wond'ring how thou took'st it.

	Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.

	Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	I knew him.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	We thank you, maiden;
	But may not be so credulous of cure,
	When our most learned doctors leave us, and
	The congregated college have concluded
	That labouring art can never ransom nature
	From her inaidable estate; I say we must not
	So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
	To prostitute our past-cure malady
	To empirics, or to dissever so
	Our great self and our credit, to esteem
	A senseless help when help past sense we deem.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful.
	Thou thought'st to help me, and such thanks I give
	As one near death to those that wish him live;
	But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,
	I knowing all my peril, thou no art.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	I must not hear thee: fare thee well, kind maid.
	Thy pains, not us'd, must by thyself be paid:
	Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	Art thou so confident? Within what space
	Hop'st thou my cure?
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	Upon thy certainty and confidence
	What dar'st thou venture?
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak,
	His powerful sound within an organ weak;
	And what impossibility would slay
	In common sense, sense saves another way.
	Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
	Worth name of life in thee hath estimate;
	Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, virtue, all
	That happiness and prime can happy call:
	Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
	Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
	Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,
	That ministers thine own death if I die.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	Make thy demand.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	Ay, by my sceptre, and my hopes of heaven.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	Here is my hand; the premises observ'd,
	Thy will by my performance shall be serv'd:
	So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
	Thy resolv'd patient, on thee still rely.
	More should I question thee, and more I must,
	Though more to know could not be more to trust,
	From whence thou cam'st, how tended on; but rest
	Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
	Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed
	As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
	Go, call before me all the lords in court.
	Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side:
	And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense
	Thou hast repeal'd, a second time receive
	The confirmation of my promised gift,
	Which but attends thy naming.
	Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel
	Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,
	O'er whom both sov'reign power and father's voice
	I have to use: thy frank election make;
	Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
	Peruse them well:
	Not one of those but had a noble father.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
	Make choice; and see,
	Who shuns thy love, shuns all his love in me.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
	Why then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
	Know'st thou not, Bertram,
	What she has done for me?
<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
	Thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
	'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which
	I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
	Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,
	Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
	In differences so mighty. If she be
	All that is virtuous, save what thou dislik'st,
	A poor physician's daughter, thou dislik'st
	Of virtue for the name; but do not so:
	From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
	The place is dignified by the doer's deed:
	Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,
	It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
	Is good without a name: vileness is so:
	The property by what it is should go,
	Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
	In these to nature she's immediate heir,
	And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn
	Which challenges itself as honour's born,
	And is not like the sire: honours thrive
	When rather from our acts we them derive
	Than our foregoers. The mere word's a slave,
	Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave
	A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb
	Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
	Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?
	If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
	I can create the rest: virtue and she
	Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
	Thou wrong'st thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
	My honour's at the stake, which to defeat
	I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
	Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,
	That dost in vile misprision shackle up
	My love and her desert; thou canst not dream
	We, poising us in her defective scale,
	Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,
	It is in us to plant thine honour where
	We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt:
	Obey our will, which travails in thy good:
	Believe not thy disdain, but presently
	Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
	Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
	Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
	Into the staggers and the careless lapse
	Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
	Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,
	Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	Take her by the hand,
	And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise
	A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
	A balance more replete.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	Good fortune and the favour of the king
	Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
	Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
	And be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast
	Shall more attend upon the coming space,
	Expecting absent friends. As thou lov'st her,
	Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
	We lost a jewel of her, and our esteem
	Was made much poorer by it: but your son,
	As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know
	Her estimation home.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
	My honour'd lady,
	I have forgiven and forgotten all,
	Though my revenges were high bent upon him,
	And watch'd the time to shoot.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
	Praising what is lost
	Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;
	We are reconcil'd, and the first view shall kill
	All repetition. Let him not ask our pardon:
	The nature of his great offence is dead,
	And deeper than oblivion we do bury
	The incensing relics of it: let him approach,
	A stranger, no offender; and inform him
	So 'tis our will he should.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	What says he to your daughter? have you spoke?
<SPEECH 47><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me,
	That set him high in fame.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	I am not a day of season,
	For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
	In me at once; but to the brightest beams
	Distracted clouds give way: so stand thou forth;
	The time is fair again.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	All is whole;
	Not one word more of the consumed time.
	Let's take the instant by the forward top,
	For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees
	The inaudible and noiseless foot of time
	Steals ere we can effect them. You remember
	The daughter of this lord?
<SPEECH 50><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	Well excus'd:
	That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away
	From the great compt. But love that comes too late,
	Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
	To the great sender turns a sour offence,
	Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rasher faults
	Make trivial price of serious things we have,
	Not knowing them until we know their grave:
	Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,
	Destroy our friends and after weep their dust:
	Our own love waking cries to see what's done,
	While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.
	Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.
	Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:
	The main consents are had; and here we'll stay
	To see our widower's second marriage-day.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,
	While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.—
	This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,
	I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
	Necessitied to help, that by this token
	I would relieve her. Had you that craft to reave her
	Of what should stead her most?
<SPEECH 52><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	Plutus himself,
	That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,
	Hath not in nature's mystery more science
	Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,
	Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know
	That you are well acquainted with yourself,
	Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
	You got it from her. She call'd the saints to surety,
	That she would never put it from her finger
	Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,
	Where you have never come, or sent it us
	Upon her great disaster.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
	Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;
	And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me
	Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
	That thou art so inhuman,—'twill not prove so;—
	And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,
	And she is dead; which nothing, but to close
	Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,
	More than to see this ring. Take him away.
	My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,
	Shall tax my fears of little vanity,
	Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him!
	We'll sift this matter further.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
	I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.

	"Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow him to his country for justice. Grant it me, O king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.
