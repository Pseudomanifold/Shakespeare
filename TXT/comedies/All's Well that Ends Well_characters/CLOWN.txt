	'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 3><11%>
	No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though many of the rich are damned. But, if I may have your ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel the woman and I will do as we may.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
	I do beg your good will in this case.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
	In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no heritage; and I think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue o' my body, for they say barnes are blessings.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
	My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
	Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
	I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry that I may repent.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
	I am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to have friends for my wife's sake.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
	You're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of. He that ears my land spares my team, and gives me leave to in the crop: if I be his cuckold, he's my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in marriage; for young Charbon the puritan, and old Poysam the papist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in religion, their heads are both one; they may joul horns together like any deer i' the herd.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 3><13%>
	A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way:
	For I the ballad will repeat,
	Which men full true shall find;
	Your marriage comes by destiny,
	Your cuckoo sings by kind.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 3><13%>
	Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,
	Why the Grecians sacked Troy?
	Fond done, done fond,
	Was this King Priam's joy?
	With that she sighed as she stood,
	With that she sighed as she stood,
	And gave this sentence then;
	Among nine bad if one be good,
	Among nine bad if one be good,
	There's yet one good in ten.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 3><13%>
	One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying o' the song. Would God would serve the world so all the year! we'd find no fault with the tithe-woman if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An we might have a good woman born but for every blazing star, or at an earthquake,'twould mend the lottery well: a man may draw his heart out ere a' pluck one.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	That man should be at woman's command, and yet no hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 2><27%>
	I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I know my business is but to the court.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 2><27%>
	Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand, and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the court. But, for me, I have an answer will serve all men.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 2><27%>
	It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks; the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn-buttock, or any buttock.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib's rush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove-Tuesday, a morris for Mayday, as the nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding quean to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the friar's mouth; nay, as the pudding to his skin.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any question.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should speak truth of it. Here it is, and all that belongs to't: ask me if I am a courtier; it shall do you no harm to learn.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	O Lord, sir! there's a simple putting off. More, more, a hundred of them.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	O Lord, sir! Spare not me.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord, sir!' I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	O Lord, sir! why, there't serves well again.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	Not much commendation to them.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	She is not well; but yet she has her health; she's very merry; but yet she is not well: but thanks be given, she's very well, and wants nothing i' the world; but yet she is not well.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 4><40%>
	Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 4><40%>
	One, that she's not in heaven, whither
	God send her quickly! the other, that she's in earth, from whence God send her quickly!
<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 4><40%>
	So that you had her wrinkles, and I her money, I would she did as you say.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 4><40%>
	Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's tongue shakes out his master's undoing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which is within a very little of nothing.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 4><40%>
	You should have said, sir, before a knave thou'rt a knave; that is, before me thou'rt a knave: this had been truth, sir.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 4><40%>
	Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable; and much fool may you find in you, even to the world's pleasure and the increase of laughter.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
	By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very melancholy man.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
	Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
	I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court. Our old ling and our Isbels o' the country are nothing like your old ling and your Isbels o' the court: the brains of my Cupid's knocked out, and I begin to love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
	E'en that you have there.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	O madam! yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers and my young lady.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort; your son will not be killed so soon as I thought he would.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does: the danger is in standing to't; that's the loss of men, though it be the getting of children. Here they come will tell you more; for my part, I only hear your son was run away.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 4><SCENE 5><81%>
	Indeed, sir, she was the sweet-marjoram of the salad, or, rather the herb of grace.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 4><SCENE 5><81%>
	I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much skill in grass.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 4><SCENE 5><82%>
	A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 4><SCENE 5><82%>
	I would cozen the man of his wife, and do his service.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 4><SCENE 5><82%>
	And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 4><SCENE 5><82%>
	At your service.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 4><SCENE 5><82%>
	Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a prince as you are.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 4><SCENE 5><82%>
	Faith, sir, a' has an English name; but his phisnomy is more hotter in France than there.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 4><SCENE 5><82%>
	The black prince, sir; alias, the prince of darkness; alias, the devil.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 4><SCENE 5><82%>
	I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a great fire; and the master I speak of, ever keeps a good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the world; let his nobility remain in's court. I am for the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be too little for pomp to enter: some that humble themselves may; but the many will be too chill and tender, and they'll be for the flowery way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 4><SCENE 5><83%>
	If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be jade's tricks, which are their own right by the law of nature.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 4><SCENE 5><84%>
	O madam! yonder's my lord your son with a patch of velvet on's face: whether there be a scar under it or no, the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of velvet. His left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a half, but his right cheek is worn bare.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 4><SCENE 5><84%>
	But it is your carbonadoed face.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 4><SCENE 5><84%>
	Faith, there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine hats and most courteous feathers, which bow the head and nod at every man.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 5><SCENE 2><86%>
	Truly, Fortune's displeasure is but sluttish if it smell so strongly as thou speakest of: I will henceforth eat no fish of Fortune's buttering. Prithee, allow the wind.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 5><SCENE 2><86%>
	Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my nose; or against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get thee further.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 5><SCENE 2><86%>
	Foh! prithee, stand away: a paper from Fortune's close-stool to give to a nobleman! Look, here he comes himself.
	Here is a purr of Fortune's, sir, or of Fortune's cat—but not a musk-cat—that has fallen into the unclean fishpond of her displeasure, and, as he says, is muddied withal. Pray you, sir, use the carp as you may, for he looks like a poor, decayed, ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his distress in my similes of comfort, and leave him to your lordship.
