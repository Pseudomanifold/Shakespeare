<SPEECH 1><ACT 1><SCENE 1><11%>
	Tranio, since for the great desire I had
	To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
	I am arriv'd for fruitful Lombardy,
	The pleasant garden of great Italy;
	And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
	With his good will and thy good company,
	My trusty servant well approv'd in all,
	Here let us breathe, and haply institute
	A course of learning and ingenious studies.
	Pisa, renowned for grave citizens,
	Gave me my being and my father first,
	A merchant of great traffic through the world,
	Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii.
	Vincentio's son, brought up in Florence,
	It shall become to serve all hopes conceiv'd,
	To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:
	And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
	Virtue and that part of philosophy
	Will I apply that treats of happiness
	By virtue specially to be achiev'd.
	Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
	And am to Padua come, as he that leaves
	A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,
	And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><13%>
	Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
	If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,
	We could at once put us in readiness,
	And take a lodging fit to entertain
	Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
	But stay awhile: what company is this?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><14%>
	But in the other's silence do I see
	Maid's mild behaviour and sobriety.
	Peace, Tranio!
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><14%>
	Hark, Tranio! thou mayst hear Minerva speak.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><17%>
	O Tranio! till I found it to be true,
	I never thought it possible or likely;
	But see, while idly I stood looking on,
	I found the effect of love in idleness;
	And now in plainness do confess to thee,
	That art to me as secret and as dear
	As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was,
	Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
	If I achieve not this young modest girl.
	Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst:
	Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><17%>
	Gramercies, lad; go forward: this contents:
	The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><17%>
	O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
	Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
	That made great Jove to humble him to her hand,
	When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><17%>
	Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move,
	And with her breath she did perfume the air;
	Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><18%>
	Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
	But art thou not advis'd he took some care
	To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><18%>
	I have it, Tranio.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><18%>
	Tell me thine first.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><18%>
	It is: may it be done?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><18%>
	Basta; content thee; for I have it full.
	We have not yet been seen in any house,
	Nor can we be distinguish'd by our faces
	For man, or master: then, it follows thus:
	Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
	Keep house, and port, and servants, as I should:
	I will some other be; some Florentine,
	Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
	'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once
	Uncase thee, take my colour'd hat and cloak:
	When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
	But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 1><19%>
	Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves;
	And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid
	Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
	Here comes the rogue.
	Sirrah, where have you been?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 1><19%>
	Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,
	And therefore frame your manners to the time.
	Your fellow Tranio, here, to save my life,
	Puts my apparel and my countenance on,
	And I for my escape have put on his;
	For in a quarrel since I came ashore
	I kill'd a man, and fear I was descried.
	Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
	While I make way from hence to save my life:
	You understand me?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 1><20%>
	And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
	Tranio is changed to Lucentio.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 1><20%>
	Tranio, let's go. One thing more rests, that thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if thou ask me why, sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 2><26%>
	Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you,
	As for my patron, stand you so assur'd,
	As firmly as yourself were still in place;
	Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
	Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 2><29%>
	</STAGE DIR> Well begun, Tranio.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 2><30%>
	Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:
	Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
	Her sister Katharine welcom'd you withal?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Preposterous ass, that never read so far
	To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
	Was it not to refresh the mind of man
	After his studies or his usual pain?
	Then give me leave to read philosophy,
	And while I pause, serve in your harmony.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	That will be never: tune vour instrument.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Here, madam:—
	Hac ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
	Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Hac ibat, as I told you before, Simois, I am Lucentio, hic est, son unto Vincentio of Pisa, Sigeia tellus, disguised thus to get your love; Hic steterat, and that Lucentio that comes a wooing, Priami, is my man Tranio, regia, bearing my port, celsa senis, that we might beguile the old pantaloon.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	All but the base.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	Mistrust it not; for, sure, Æacides
	Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	Are you so formal, sir? <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Well, I must wait,
	And watch withal; for, but I be deceiv'd,
	Our fine musician groweth amorous.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster
	Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
	'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
	Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
	I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
	Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	I read that I profess, the Art to Love.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
	Then we are rid of Licio.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 2><70%>
	And what of him, Tranio?
<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	I pray the gods she may with all my heart!
<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	What sayst thou, Biondello?
<SPEECH 40><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	Biondello, what of that?
<SPEECH 41><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	I pray thee, moralize them.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	And what of him?
<SPEECH 43><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	And then?
<SPEECH 44><ACT 4><SCENE 4><83%>
	And what of all this?
<SPEECH 45><ACT 4><SCENE 4><83%>
	Hearest thou, Biondello?
<SPEECH 46><ACT 4><SCENE 4><83%>
	I may, and will, if she be so contented:
	She will be pleas'd; then wherefore should I doubt?
	Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her:
	It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need thee at home; therefore leave us.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	</STAGE DIR> Pardon, sweet father.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	Here's Lucentio,
	Right son to the right Vincentio;
	That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
	While counterfeit supposes blear'd thine eyne.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
	Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
	While he did bear my countenance in the town;
	And happily I have arriv'd at last
	Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
	What Tranio did, myself enforc'd him to;
	Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:
	And time it is, when raging war is done,
	To smile at 'scapes and perils overblown.
	My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
	While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
	Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,
	And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
	Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:
	My banquet is to close our stomachs up,
	After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
	For now we sit to chat as well as eat.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	Twenty crowns.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	A hundred then.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	That will I.
	Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
	I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.
	How now! what news?
<SPEECH 58><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
	Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
	I would your duty were as foolish too:
	The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
	Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.
<SPEECH 60><ACT 5><SCENE 2><100%>
	Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha't.
<SPEECH 61><ACT 5><SCENE 2><100%>
	But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 5><SCENE 2><100%>
	'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tam'd so.
