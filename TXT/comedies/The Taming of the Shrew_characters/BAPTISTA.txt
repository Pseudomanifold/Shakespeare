	Gentlemen, importune me no further,
	For how I firmly am resolv'd you know;
	That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter
	Before I have a husband for the elder.
	If either of you both love Katharina,
	Because I know you well and love you well,
	Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><14%>
	Gentlemen, that I may soon make good
	What I have said,—Bianca, get you in:
	And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
	For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><14%>
	Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolv'd.
	Go in, Bianca.
	And for I know she taketh most delight
	In music, instruments, and poetry,
	Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,
	Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
	Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
	Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
	I will be very kind, and liberal
	To mine own children in good bringing up;
	And so, farewell. Katharina, you may stay;
	For I have more to commune with Bianca.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><32%>
	Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?
	Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.
	Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
	For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit,
	Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
	When did she cross thee with a bitter word?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><32%>
	What! in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><32%>
	Was ever gentleman thus griev'd as I?

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>
	Good morrow, neighbour Gremio. God save you, gentlemen!
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>
	I have a daughter, sir, call'd Katharina.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>
	You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.
	But for my daughter Katharine, this I know,
	She is not for your turn, the more my grief.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><34%>
	Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
	Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 1><34%>
	I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 1><34%>
	A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio; welcome, good Cambio.—<STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger: may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 1><35%>
	Lucentio is your name, of whence, I pray?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 1><35%>
	A mighty man of Pisa; by report
	I know him well: you are very welcome, sir.
	</STAGE DIR> and you the set of books;
	You shall go see your pupils presently.
	Holla, within!
	Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
	To my two daughters, and then tell them both
	These are their tutors: bid them use them well.
	We will go walk a little in the orchard,
	And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
	And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 1><36%>
	After my death the one half of my lands,

<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 1><36%>
	Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
	That is, her love; for that is all in all.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 1><36%>
	Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
	But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 1><36%>
	How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 1><37%>
	What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 1><37%>
	Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 1><37%>
	</STAGE DIR> Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited:
	Proceed in practice with my younger daughter;
	She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.
	Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
	Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 1><42%>
	Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 1><42%>
	Why, how now, daughter Katharine! in your dumps?
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 1><43%>
	I know not what to say; but give me your hands.
	God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 1><43%>
	Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
	And venture madly on a desperate mart.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 1><44%>
	The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 1><44%>
	Content you, gentlemen; I'll compound this strife:
	'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he, of both,
	That can assure my daughter greatest dower
	Shall have my Bianca's love.
	Say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 1><46%>
	I must confess your offer is the best;
	And, let your father make her the assurance,
	She is your own; else, you must pardon me:
	If you should die before him, where's her dower?
<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 1><46%>
	Well, gentlemen,
	I am thus resolv'd. On Sunday next, you know,
	My daughter Katharine is to be married:
	Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
	Be bride to you, if you make this assurance;
	If not, to Signior Gremio:
	And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	</STAGE DIR> Signior Lucentio, this is the 'pointed day
	That Katharine and Petruchio should be married,
	And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
	What will be said? what mockery will it be
	To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
	To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
	What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?
<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	Go, girl: I cannot blame thee now to weep,
	For such an injury would vex a very saint,
	Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	Is it new and old too? how may that be?
<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
	Is he come?
<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
	What then?
<SPEECH 35><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
	When will he be here?
<SPEECH 36><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	Who comes with him?
<SPEECH 37><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	I am glad he is come, howsoe'er he comes.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	Didst thou not say he comes?
<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	Ay, that Petruchio came.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	Why, that's all one.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	You are welcome, sir.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	And yet you halt not.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	Why, sir, you know this is your weddingday:
	First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
	Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
	Fie! doff this habit, shame to your estate,
	An eye-sore to our solemn festival.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	I'll after him, and see the event of this.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	Is't possible you will away to-night?
<SPEECH 47><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
	Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
	Neighbours and friends, though bride and bridegroom wants
	For to supply the places at the table,
	You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
	Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place,
	And let Bianca take her sister's room.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
	She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 4><SCENE 4><81%>
	Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:
	Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
	Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
	Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,
	Or both dissemble deeply their affections:
	And therefore, if you say no more than this,
	That like a father you will deal with him
	And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
	The match is made, and all is done:
	Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 4><SCENE 4><81%>
	Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,
	Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants.
	Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still,
	And happily we might be interrupted.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,
	And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
	And, if you will, tell what hath happened:
	Lucentio's father is arriv'd in Padua,
	And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	I follow you.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	What, is the man lunatic?
<SPEECH 55><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do you think is his name?
<SPEECH 56><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!
<SPEECH 58><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	How hast thou offended?
	Where is Lucentio?
<SPEECH 59><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?
<SPEECH 60><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	</STAGE DIR> But do you hear, sir?
	Have you married my daughter without asking my good will?
<SPEECH 61><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
<SPEECH 64><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.
<SPEECH 65><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
	I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
<SPEECH 66><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	Son, I will be your half, Bianca comes.
<SPEECH 67><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
	Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!
<SPEECH 68><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
	Now fair befall thee, good Petruchio!
	The wager thou hast won; and I will add
	Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
	Another dowry to another daughter,
	For she is chang'd, as she had never been.
