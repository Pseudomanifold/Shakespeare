	How fares my noble lord?
<SPEECH 2><SCENE 2><10%>
	Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her?
<SPEECH 3><SCENE 2><10%>
	My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;
	I am your wife in all obedience.
<SPEECH 4><SCENE 2><10%>
	Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
	Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.
<SPEECH 5><SCENE 2><10%>
	Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you
	To pardon me yet for a night or two,
	Or, if not so, until the sun be set:
	For your physicians have expressly charg'd,
	In peril to incur your former malady,
	That I should yet absent me from your bed:
	I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
<SPEECH 6><SCENE 2><11%>
	No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.
<SPEECH 7><SCENE 2><11%>
	It is a kind of history.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><20%>
	My lord, 'tis but begun.
