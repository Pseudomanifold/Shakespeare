	I'll pheeze you, in faith.

	Y'are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror. Therefore, paucas pallabris; let the world slide. Sessa!
<SPEECH 3><SCENE 1><1%>
	No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy, go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.
<SPEECH 4><SCENE 1><1%>
	Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him by law. I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come, and kindly.
<SPEECH 5><SCENE 2><6%>
	For God's sake! a pot of small ale.
<SPEECH 6><SCENE 2><6%>
	I am Christophero Sly; call not me honour, nor lordship: I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if you give me any conserves, give me conserves of beef. Ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear, for I have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings than legs, nor no more shoes than feet: nay, sometime more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my toes look through the overleather.
<SPEECH 7><SCENE 2><6%>
	What! would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher Sly, old Sly's son, of Burtonheath; by birth a pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker? Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not bestraught: here'sâ€”
<SPEECH 8><SCENE 2><8%>
	Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?
	Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?
	I do not sleep; I see, I hear, I speak;
	I smell sweet savours, and I feel soft things:
	Upon my life, I am a lord indeed;
	And not a tinker, nor Christophero Sly.
	Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;
	And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.
<SPEECH 9><SCENE 2><9%>
	These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.
	But did I never speak of all that time?
<SPEECH 10><SCENE 2><9%>
	Ay, the woman's maid of the house.
<SPEECH 11><SCENE 2><9%>
	Now, Lord be thanked for my good amends!
<SPEECH 12><SCENE 2><9%>
	I thank thee; thou shalt not lose by it.
<SPEECH 13><SCENE 2><10%>
	Marry, I fare well, for here is cheer enough.
	Where is my wife?
<SPEECH 14><SCENE 2><10%>
	Are you my wife, and will not call me husband?
	My men should call me lord: I am your goodman.
<SPEECH 15><SCENE 2><10%>
	I know it well. What must I call her?
<SPEECH 16><SCENE 2><10%>
	Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?
<SPEECH 17><SCENE 2><10%>
	Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd
	And slept above some fifteen year or more.
<SPEECH 18><SCENE 2><10%>
	'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.
	Madam, undress you, and come now to bed.
<SPEECH 19><SCENE 2><10%>
	Ay, it stands so, that I may hardly tarry so long; but I would be loath to fall into my dreams again: I will therefore tarry, in spite of the flesh and the blood.
<SPEECH 20><SCENE 2><11%>
	Marry, I will; let them play it. Is not a commonty a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?
<SPEECH 21><SCENE 2><11%>
	What! household stuff?
<SPEECH 22><SCENE 2><11%>
	Well, we'll see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side,
	And let the world slip: we shall ne'er be younger.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 1><20%>
	Yes, by Saint Anne, I do. A good matter, surely: comes there any more of it?
<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 1><20%>
	'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady: would 'twere done!
