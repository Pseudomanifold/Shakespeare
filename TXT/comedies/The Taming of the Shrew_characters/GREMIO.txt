	To cart her rather: she's too rough for me.
	There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><14%>
	And me too, good Lord!
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><14%>
	Why will you mew her up,
	Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
	And make her bear the penance of her tongue?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><15%>
	You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together, and fast it fairly out: our cake's dough on both sides. Farewell: yet, for the love I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to her father.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><15%>
	What's that, I pray?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><16%>
	A husband! a devil.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><16%>
	I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><16%>
	I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with this condition, to be whipped at the high-cross every morning.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><16%>
	I am agreed: and would I had given him the best horse in Padua to begin his wooing, that would thoroughly woo her, wed her, and bed her, and rid the house of her. Come on.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 2><26%>
	O! very well; I have perus'd the note.
	Hark you, sir; I'll have them very fairly bound:
	All books of love, see that at any hand,
	And see you read no other lectures to her.
	You understand me. Over and beside
	Signior Baptista's liberality,
	I'll mend it with a largess. Take your papers too,
	And let me have them very well perfum'd;
	For she is sweeter than perfume itself
	To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 2><26%>
	O! this learning, what a thing it is.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 2><26%>
	And you're well met, Signior Hortensio.
	Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
	I promis'd to inquire carefully
	About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca;
	And, by good fortune, I have lighted well
	On this young man; for learning and behaviour
	Fit for her turn; well read in poetry
	And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 2><27%>
	Belov'd of me, and that my deeds shall prove.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 2><27%>
	So said, so done, is well.
	Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 2><27%>
	No, sayst me so, friend? What countryman?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 2><27%>
	O, sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!
	But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:
	You shall have me assisting you in all.
	But will you woo this wild-cat?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 2><28%>
	Hortensio, hark:
	This gentleman is happily arriv'd,
	My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 2><28%>
	And so we will, provided that he win her.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 2><29%>
	Hark you, sir; you mean not her toâ€”
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 2><29%>
	No; if without more words you will get you hence.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 2><29%>
	But so is not she.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 2><29%>
	For this reason, if you'll know,
	That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 2><29%>
	What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 2><30%>
	Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules,
	And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>
	Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>
	You are too blunt: go to it orderly.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 1><34%>
	Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
	Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too.
	Backare! you are marvellous forward.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 1><34%>
	I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your wooing.
	Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it. To express the like kindness myself, that have been more kindly beholding to you than any, freely give unto you this young scholar, <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> that has been long studying at Rheims; as cunning in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other in music and mathematics. His name is Cambio; pray accept his service.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 1><42%>
	Hark, Petruchio: she says she'll see thee hang'd first.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 1><43%>
	Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 1><43%>
	Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 1><44%>
	No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
	But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter:
	Now is the day we long have looked for:
	I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 1><44%>
	Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 1><44%>
	But thine doth fry.
	Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 1><44%>
	First, as you know, my house within the city
	Is richly furnished with plate and gold:
	Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
	My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
	In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
	In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
	Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
	Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
	Valance of Venice gold in needle-work,
	Pewter and brass, and all things that belong
	To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
	I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
	Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
	And all things answerable to this portion.
	Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
	And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,
	If whilst I live she will be only mine.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 1><45%>
	Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
	My land amounts not to so much in all:
	That she shall have; besides an argosy
	That now is lying in Marseilles' road.
	What, have I chok'd you with an argosy?
<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 1><45%>
	Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;
	And she can have no more than all I have:
	If you like me, she shall have me and mine.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 1><46%>
	And may not young men die as well as old?
<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 1><46%>
	Adieu, good neighbour. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Now I fear thee not:
	Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
	To give thee all, and in his waning age
	Set foot under thy table. Tut! a toy!
	An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
	As willingly as e'er I came from school.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
	A bridegroom say you? 'Tis a groom indeed,
	A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
	Why, he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
	Tut! she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him.
	I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
	Should ask, if Katharine should be his wife,
	'Ay, by gogs-wouns!' quoth he; and swore so loud,
	That, all amaz'd, the priest let fall the book;
	And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,
	The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
	That down fell priest and book and book and priest:
	'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'
<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
	Trembled and shook; for why he stampt and swore,
	As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
	But after many ceremonies done,
	He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he; as if
	He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
	After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel,
	And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
	Having no other reason
	But that his beard grew thin and hungerly,
	And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
	This done, he took the bride about the neck,
	And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
	That at the parting all the church did echo:
	And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame;
	And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
	Such a mad marriage never was before.
	Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	Let me entreat you.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
	Went they not quickly I should die with laughing.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
	I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	They're busy within; you were best knock louder.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	Nay, I dare not swear it.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	Here's packing, with a witness, to deceive us all!
<SPEECH 56><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,
	Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
	Ay, and a kind one too:
	Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.
