	He wonder'd that your lordship
	Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,
	While other men, of slender reputation,
	Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:
	Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;
	Some to discover islands far away;
	Some to the studious universities.
	For any or for all these exercises
	He said that Proteus your son was meet,
	And did request me to importune you
	To let him spend his time no more at home,
	Which would be great impeachment to his age,
	In having known to travel in his youth.

	I think your lordship is not ignorant
	How his companion, youthful Valentine,
	Attends the emperor in his royal court.

	'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:
	There shall be practise tilts and tournaments,
	Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen,
	And be in eye of every exercise
	Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.

	To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso
	With other gentlemen of good esteem,
	Are journeying to salute the emperor

	Sir Proteus, you are stay'd for.

	Launce, away, away, aboard! thy master is shipped, and thou art to post after with oars. What's the matter? why weepest thou, man? Away, ass! you'll lose the tide if you tarry any longer.

	What's the unkindest tide?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 3><28%>
	Tut, man, I mean thou'lt lose the flood; and, in losing the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing thy voyage, lose thy master; and, in losing thy master, lose thy service; and, in losing thy service,â€”Why dost thou stop my mouth?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 3><29%>
	Where should I lose my tongue?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 3><29%>
	In thy tail!

	Come, come away, man; I was sent to call thee.

	Wilt thou go?
