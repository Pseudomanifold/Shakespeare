	Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.
	Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:
	What say you to a letter from your friends
	Of much good news?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 4><31%>
	Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 4><31%>
	Hath he not a son?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 4><31%>
	You know him well?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 4><32%>
	Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,
	He is as worthy for an empress' love
	As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.
	Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me
	With commendation from great potentates;
	And here he means to spend his time awhile:
	I think, 'tis no unwelcome news to you.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 4><32%>
	Welcome him then according to his worth.
	Silvia, I speak to you; and you, Sir Thurio:—
	For Valentine, I need not cite him to it.
	I'll send him hither to you presently.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;
	We have some secrets to confer about.
	Now tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care,
	Which to requite, command me while I live.
	This love of theirs myself have often seen,
	Haply, when they have judg'd me fast asleep,
	And oftentimes have purpos'd to forbid
	Sir Valentine her company and my court;
	But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
	And so unworthily disgrace the man,—
	A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,—
	I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
	That which thyself hast now disclos'd to me.
	And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
	Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
	I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,
	The key whereof myself have ever kept;
	And thence she cannot be convey'd away.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	Upon mine honour, he shall never know
	That I had any light from thee of this.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	Be they of much import?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	Nay then, no matter: stay with me awhile;
	I am to break with thee of some affairs
	That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.
	'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
	To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	No, trust me: she is peevish, sullen, froward,
	Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty;
	Neither regarding that she is my child,
	Nor fearing me as if I were her father:
	And, may I say to thee this pride of hers,
	Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;
	And, where I thought the remnant of mine age
	Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,
	I now am full resolv'd to take a wife
	And turn her out to who will take her in:
	Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;
	For me and my possessions she esteems not.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	There is a lady of Verona here,
	Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy
	And nought esteems my aged eloquence:
	Now therefore, would I have thee to my tutor,
	For long agone I have forgot to court;
	Besides, the fashion of the time is chang'd,
	How and which way I may bestow myself
	To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	But she I mean is promis'd by her friends
	Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,
	And kept severely from resort of men,
	That no man hath access by day to her.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,
	That no man hath recourse to her by night.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
	And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
	Without apparent hazard of his life.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
	Advise me where I may have such a ladder.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	This very night; for Love is like a child,
	That longs for every thing that he can come by.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	But hark thee; I will go to her alone:
	How shall I best convey the ladder thither?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	Then let me see thy cloak:
	I'll get me one of such another length.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 1><53%>
	How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
	I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.
	What letter is this same? What's here?—To Silvia!
	And here an engine fit for my proceeding!
	I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.
	My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly;
	And slaves they are to me that send them flying
	O! could their master come and go as lightly,
	Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!
	My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them;
	While I, their king, that thither them importune,
	Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,
	Because myself do want my servants' fortune:
	I curse myself, for they are sent by me,
	That they should harbour where their lord would be.
	What's here?
	Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee
	'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
	Why, Phaethon,—for thou art Merops' son,—
	Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
	And with thy daring folly burn the world?
	Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?
	Go, basc intruder! overweening slave!
	Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,
	And think my patience, more than thy desert,
	Is privilege for thy departure hence.
	Thank me for this more than for all the favours
	Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.
	But if thou linger in my territories
	Longer than swiftest expedition
	Will give thee time to leave our royal court,
	By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love
	I ever borc my daughter or thyself.
	Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;
	But, as thou lov'st thy life, make speed from hence.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 2><63%>
	Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you,
	Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 2><63%>
	This weak impress of love is as a figure
	Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat
	Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
	A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,
	And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
	How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman
	According to our proclamation gone?
<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 2><63%>
	My daughter takes his going grievously.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 2><64%>
	So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.
	Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee,—
	For thou hast shown some sign of good desert,—
	Makes me the better to confer with thee.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 2><64%>
	Thou know'st how willingly I would effect
	The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 2><64%>
	And also, I think, thou art not ignorant
	How she opposes her against my will.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 2><64%>
	Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
	What might we do to make the girl forget
	The love of Valentine, and love Sir Thurio?
<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 2><64%>
	Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 2><64%>
	Then you must undertake to slander him.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 2><65%>
	Where your good word cannot advantage him,
	Your slander never can endamage him:
	Therefore the office is indifferent,
	Being entreated to it by your friend.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 3><SCENE 2><65%>
	And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,
	Because we know, on Valentine's report,
	You are already Love's firm votary
	And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
	Upon this warrant shall you have access
	Where you with Silvia may confer at large;
	For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,
	And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you;
	Where you may temper her, by your persuasion
	To hate young Valentine and love my friend.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 3><SCENE 2><66%>
	Ay,
	Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 3><SCENE 2><67%>
	This discipline shows thou hast been in love.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 2><67%>
	About it, gentlemen!
<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 2><67%>
	Even now about it! I will pardon you.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!
	Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?
<SPEECH 41><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	Saw you my daughter?
<SPEECH 42><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	Why then,
	She's fled unto that peasant Valentine,
	And Eglamour is in her company.
	'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,
	As he in penance wander'd through the forest;
	Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,
	But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it;
	Besides, she did intend confession
	At Patrick's cell this even, and there she was not.
	These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
	Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,
	But mount you presently and meet with me
	Upon the rising of the mountain-foot,
	That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled.
	Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 4><98%>
	Sir Valentine!
<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 4><98%>
	The more degenerate and base art thou,
	To make such means for her as thou hast done,
	And leave her on such slight conditions.
	Now, by the honour of my ancestry,
	I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,
	And think thee worthy of an empress' love.
	Know then, I here forget all former griefs,
	Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
	Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,
	To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,
	Thou art a gentleman and well deriv'd;
	Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserv'd her.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 4><99%>
	I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 5><SCENE 4><99%>
	Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them, and thee:
	Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.
	Come, let us go: we will include all jars
	With triumphs, mirth, and rare solemnity.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 5><SCENE 4><100%>
	I think the boy hath grace in him: he blushes.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 4><100%>
	What mean you by that saying?
