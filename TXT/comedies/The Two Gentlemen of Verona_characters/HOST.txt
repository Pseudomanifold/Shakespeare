	Now, my young guest, methinks you're allycholly: I pray you, why is it?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 2><72%>
	Come, we'll have you merry. I'll bring you where you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 2><72%>
	Ay, that you shall.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 2><72%>
	Hark! hark!
<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 2><72%>
	Ay; but peace! let's hear 'em.
	Who is Silvia? what is she?
	That all our swains commend her?
	Holy, fair, and wise is she;
	The heaven such grace did lend her,
	That she might admired be.
	Is she kind as she is fair?
	For beauty lives with kindness:
	Love doth to her eyes repair,
	To help him of his blindness;
	And, being help'd, inhabits there.
	Then to Silvia let us sing,
	That Silvia is excelling;
	She excels each mortal thing
	Upon the dull earth dwelling;
	To her let us garlands bring.
