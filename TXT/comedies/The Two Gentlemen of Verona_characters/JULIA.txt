	Say, say, who gave it thee?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
	Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
	To whisper and conspire against my youth?
	Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
	And you an officer fit for the place.
	There, take the paper: see it be return'd;
	Or else return no more into my sight.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	Will ye be gone?
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	And yet I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
	It were a shame to call her back again
	And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
	What fool is she, that knows I am a maid,
	And would not force the letter to my view!
	Since maids, in modesty, say 'No' to that
	Which they would have the profferer construe 'Ay.'
	Fie, fie! how wayward is this foolish love
	That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse
	And presently all humbled kiss the rod!
	How churlishly I child Lucetta hence,
	When willingly I would have had her here:
	How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
	When inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile.
	My penance is, to call Lucetta back
	And ask remission for my folly past.
	What ho! Lucetta!

	You do not?
<SPEECH 30><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	You, minion, are too saucy.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
	Here is a coil with protestation!—
	Go, get you gone, and let the papers lie:
	You would be fingering them, to anger me.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!
	O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
	Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
	And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
	I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
	Look, here is writ 'kind Julia:' unkind Julia!
	As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
	I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
	Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
	And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus:'
	Poor wounded name! my bosom, as a bed
	Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal'd;
	And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
	But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down:
	Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
	Till I have found each letter in the letter,
	Except mine own name; that some whirlwind bear
	Unto a ragged, fearful hanging rock,
	And throw it thence into the raging sea!
	Lo! here in one line is his name twice writ,
	'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
	To the sweet Julia':—that I'll tear away;
	And yet I will not, sith so prettily
	He couples it to his complaining names:
	Thus will I fold them one upon another:
	Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
	Well, let us go.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>

	Come, come; will't please you go?
<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
	I must, where is no remedy.

	If you turn not, you will return the sooner.
	Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 7><43%>
	Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me:
	And e'en in kind love I do conjure thee,
	Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
	Are visibly character'd and engrav'd,
	To lesson me and tell me some good mean
	How, with my honour, I may undertake
	A journey to my loving Proteus.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 7><43%>
	A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
	To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;
	Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,
	And when the flight is made to one so dear,
	Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 2><SCENE 7><43%>
	O! know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
	Pity the dearth that I have pined in,
	By longing for that food so long a time.
	Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,
	Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
	As seek to quench the fire of love with words.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 2><SCENE 7><44%>
	The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.
	The current that with gentle murmur glides,
	Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;
	But when his fair course is not hindered,
	He makes sweet music with th' enamell'd stones,
	Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
	He overtaketh in his pilgrimage;
	And so by many winding nooks he strays
	With willing sport, to the wild ocean.
	Then let me go and hinder not my course:
	I'll be as patient as a gentle stream
	And make a pastime of each weary step,
	Till the last step have brought me to my love;
	And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil
	A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 2><SCENE 7><44%>
	Not like a woman; for I would prevent
	The loose encounters of lascivious men.
	Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
	As may beseem some well-reputed page.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 2><SCENE 7><45%>
	No, girl; I'll knit it up in silken strings
	With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots:
	To be fantastic may become a youth
	Of greater time than I shall show to be.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 2><SCENE 7><45%>
	That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,
	What compass will you wear your farthingale?'
	Why, even what fashion thou best lik'st, Lucetta.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 2><SCENE 7><45%>
	Out, out, Lucetta! that will be ill-favour'd.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 2><SCENE 7><45%>
	Lucetta, as thou lov'st me, let me have
	What thou think'st meet and is most mannerly.
	But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me
	For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
	I fear me, it will make me scandaliz'd.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 2><SCENE 7><45%>
	Nay, that I will not.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 2><SCENE 7><46%>
	That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:
	A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,
	And instances of infinite of love
	Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 2><SCENE 7><46%>
	Base men, that use them to so base effect;
	But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth:
	His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,
	His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,
	His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,
	His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 2><SCENE 7><46%>
	Now, as thou lov'st me, do him not that wrong
	To bear a hard opinion of his truth:
	Only deserve my love by loving him,
	And presently go with me to my chamber,
	To take a note of what I stand in need of
	To furnish me upon my longing journey.
	All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,
	My goods, my lands, my reputation;
	Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.
	Come, answer not, but to it presently!
	I am impatient of my tarriance.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 4><SCENE 2><72%>
	Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 4><SCENE 2><72%>
	But shall I hear him speak?
<SPEECH 56><ACT 4><SCENE 2><72%>
	That will be music.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 4><SCENE 2><72%>
	Is he among these?
<SPEECH 58><ACT 4><SCENE 2><73%>
	You mistake; the musician likes me not.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 4><SCENE 2><73%>
	He plays false, father.
<SPEECH 60><ACT 4><SCENE 2><73%>
	Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very heart-strings.
<SPEECH 61><ACT 4><SCENE 2><73%>
	Ay; I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow heart.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 4><SCENE 2><73%>
	Not a whit,—when it jars so.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 4><SCENE 2><73%>
	Ay, that change is the spite.
<SPEECH 64><ACT 4><SCENE 2><73%>
	I would always have one play but one thing.

<SPEECH 71><ACT 4><SCENE 2><76%>
	Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?
<SPEECH 72><ACT 4><SCENE 2><76%>
	Not so; but it hath been the longest night

<SPEECH 73><ACT 4><SCENE 4><81%>
	In what you please: I will do what I can.
<SPEECH 74><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	It seems, you lov'd not her, to leave her token.
	She's dead, belike?
<SPEECH 75><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	Alas!
<SPEECH 76><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	I cannot choose
	But pity her.
<SPEECH 77><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
	Because methinks that she lov'd you as well
	As you do love your lady Silvia.
	She dreams on him that has forgot her love;
	You dote on her, that cares not for your love.
	'Tis pity, love should be so contrary;
	And thinking on it makes me cry, 'alas!'
<SPEECH 78><ACT 4><SCENE 4><83%>
	How many women would do such a message?
	Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd
	A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
	Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him
	That with his very heart despiseth me?
	Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
	Because I love him, I must pity him.
	This ring I gave him when he parted from me,
	To bind him to remember my good will;
	And now am I—unhappy messenger—
	To plead for that which I would not obtain,
	To carry that which I would have refus'd,
	To praise his faith which I would have disprais'd.
	I am my master's true-confirmed love,
	But cannot be true servant to my master,
	Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
	Yet will I woo for him; but yet so coldly
	As heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.
	Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean
	To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.
<SPEECH 79><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	If you be she, I do entreat your patience To hear me speak the message I am sent on.
<SPEECH 80><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.
<SPEECH 81><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	Ay, madam.
<SPEECH 82><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	Madam, please you peruse this letter.—
	Pardon me, madam, I have unadvis'd
	Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:
	This is the letter to your ladyship.
<SPEECH 83><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	It may not be: good madam, pardon me.
<SPEECH 84><ACT 4><SCENE 4><85%>
	Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.
<SPEECH 85><ACT 4><SCENE 4><85%>
	She thanks you.
<SPEECH 86><ACT 4><SCENE 4><85%>
	I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
	Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.
<SPEECH 87><ACT 4><SCENE 4><85%>
	Almost as well as I do know myself:
	To think upon her woes, I do protest
	That I have wept a hundred several times.
<SPEECH 88><ACT 4><SCENE 4><85%>
	I think she doth, and that's her cause of sorrow.
<SPEECH 89><ACT 4><SCENE 4><85%>
	She hath been fairer, madam, than she is.
	When she did think my master lov'd her well,
	She, in my judgment, was as fair as you;
	But since she did neglect her looking-glass
	And threw her sun-expelling mask away,
	The air hath starv'd the roses in her cheeks
	And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,
	That now she is become as black as I.
<SPEECH 90><ACT 4><SCENE 4><86%>
	About my stature; for, at Pentecost,
	When all our pageants of delight were play'd,
	Our youth got me to play the woman's part,
	And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,
	Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,
	As if the garment had been made for me:
	Therefore I know she is about my height.
	And at that time I made her weep agood;
	For I did play a lamentable part.
	Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning
	For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;
	Which I so lively acted with my tears
	That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,
	Wept bitterly, and would I might be dead
	If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!
<SPEECH 91><ACT 4><SCENE 4><87%>
	And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.—
	A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful.
	I hope my master's suit will be but cold,
	Since she respects my mistress' love so much.
	Alas, how love can trifle with itself!
	Here is her picture: let me see; I think,
	If I had such a tire, this face of mine
	Were full as lovely as is this of hers;
	And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,
	Unless I flatter with myself too much.
	Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:
	If that be all the difference in his love
	I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.
	Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:
	Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.
	What should it be that he respects in her
	But I can make respective in myself,
	If this fond Love were not a blinded god?
	Come, shadow, come, and take this shadow up,
	For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form!
	Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, lov'd, and ador'd,
	And, were there sense in his idolatry,
	My substance should be statue in thy stead.
	I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,
	That us'd me so; or else, by Jove I vow,
	I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes,
	To make my master out of love with thee.
<SPEECH 92><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>

	And Julia herself hath brought it hither.
<SPEECH 106><ACT 5><SCENE 4><97%>
	Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
	And entertain'd them deeply in her heart:
	How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
	O Proteus! let this habit make thee blush.
	Be thou asham'd that I have took upon me
	Such an immodest raiment; if shame live
	In a disguise of love.
	It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
	Women to change their shapes than men their minds.
