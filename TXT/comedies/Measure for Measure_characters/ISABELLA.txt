	And have you nuns no further privileges?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 4><12%>
	Yes, truly: I speak not as desiring more,
	But rather wishing a more strict restraint
	Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 4><12%>
	Who's that which calls?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 4><13%>
	Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 4><13%>
	Why 'her unhappy brother?' let me ask;
	The rather for I now must make you know
	I am that Isabella and his sister.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 4><13%>
	Woe me! for what?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 4><13%>
	Sir, make me not your story.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 4><13%>
	You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 4><14%>
	Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 4><14%>
	Adoptedly; asschool-maids change their names

<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 4><14%>
	O! let him marry her.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 4><14%>
	Doth he so seek his life?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 4><15%>
	Alas! what poor ability's in me

<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 4><15%>
	My power? alas! I doubt—
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 4><15%>
	I'll see what I can do.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 4><15%>
	I will about it straight;
	No longer staying but to give the Mother
	Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:
	Commend me to my brother; soon at night
	I'll send him certain word of my success.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 4><15%>
	Good sir, adieu.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	I am a woful suitor to your honour,
	Please but your honour hear me.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	There is a vice that most I do abhor,
	And most desire should meet the blow of justice,
	For which I would not plead, but that I must;
	For which I must not plead, but that I am
	At war 'twixt will and will not.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 2><27%>
	I have a brother is condemn'd to die:
	I do beseech you, let it be his fault,
	And not my brother.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 2><27%>
	O just, but severe law!
	I had a brother, then.—Heaven keep your honour!
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 2><27%>
	Must he needs die?
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 2><27%>
	Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,
	And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 2><27%>
	But can you, if you would?
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 2><27%>
	But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
	If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
	As mine is to him?
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word,
	May call it back again. Well, believe this,
	No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
	Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
	The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
	Become them with one half so good a grace
	As mercy does.
	If he had been as you, and you as he,
	You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,
	Would not have been so stern.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	I would to heaven I had your potency,
	And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?
	No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,
	And what a prisoner.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	Alas! alas!
	Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
	And He that might the vantage best have took,
	Found out the remedy. How would you be,
	If He, which is the top of judgment, should
	But judge you as you are? O! think on that,
	And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
	Like man new made.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	To-morrow! O! that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!
	He's not prepar'd for death. Even for our kitchens
	We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven
	With less respect than we do minister
	To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you:
	Who is it that hath died for this offence?
	There's many have committed it.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	Yet show some pity.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
	And he that suffers. O! it is excellent
	To have a giant's strength, but it is tyrannous
	To use it like a giant.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	Could great men thunder
	As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
	For every pelting, petty officer
	Would use his heaven for thunder; nothing but thunder.
	Merciful heaven!
	Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
	Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
	Than the soft myrtle; but man, proud man,
	Drest in a little brief authority,
	Most ignorant of what he's most assur'd,
	His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
	Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
	As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,
	Would all themselves laugh mortal.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
	Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,
	But, in the less foul profanation.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	That in the captain's but a choleric word,
	Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	Because authority, though it err like others,
	Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
	That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
	Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
	That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
	A natural guiltiness such as is his,
	Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
	Against my brother's life.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	Gentle my lord, turn back.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	Hark how I'll bribe you. Good my lord, turn back.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	Not with fond sicles of the tested gold,
	Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
	As fancy values them; but with true prayers
	That shall be up at heaven and enter there
	Ere sun-rise: prayers from preserved souls,
	From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
	To nothing temporal.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	Heaven keep your honour safe!
<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	At what hour to-morrow
	Shall I attend your lordship?
<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
	Save your honour!
<SPEECH 43><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
	I am come to know your pleasure.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
	Even so. Heaven keep your honour!
<SPEECH 45><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
	Under your sentence?
<SPEECH 46><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
	When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,
	Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
	That his soul sicken not.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
	'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
	Sir, believe this,
	I had rather give my body than my soul.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
	How say you?
<SPEECH 50><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
	Please you to do't,
	I'll take it as a peril to my soul;
	It is no sin at all, but charity.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 2><SCENE 4><37%>
	That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
	Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,
	If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
	To have it added to the faults of mine,
	And nothing of your answer.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 2><SCENE 4><37%>
	Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,
	But graciously to know I am no better.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 2><SCENE 4><37%>
	So.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 2><SCENE 4><37%>
	True.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
	As much for my poor brother, as myself:
	That is, were I under the terms of death,
	Th' impression of keen whips I'd wear as rubies,
	And strip myself to death, as to a bed
	That, longing, have been sick for, ere I'd yield
	My body up to shame.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
	And 'twere the cheaper way:
	Better it were a brother died at once,
	Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
	Should die for ever.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
	Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
	Are of two houses: lawful mercy
	Is nothing kin to foul redemption.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
	O, pardon me, my lord! it oft falls out,
	To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean.
	I something do excuse the thing I hate,
	For his advantage that I dearly love.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
	Else let my brother die,
	If not a feodary, but only he
	Owe and succeed thy weakness.
<SPEECH 60><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
	Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves,
	Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
	Women! Help heaven! men their creation mar
	In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail,
	For we are soft as our complexions are,
	And credulous to false prints.
<SPEECH 61><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,
	Let me entreat you speak the former language.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	My brother did love Juliet; and you tell me
	That he shall die for't.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	I know your virtue hath a licence in't.
	Which seems a little fouler than it is,
	To pluck on others.
<SPEECH 64><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	Ha! little honour to be much believ'd,
	And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
	I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:
	Sign me a present pardon for my brother,
	Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud
	What man thou art.
<SPEECH 65><ACT 2><SCENE 4><40%>
	To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
	Who would believe me? O perilous mouths!
	That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,
	Either of condemnation or approof,
	Bidding the law make curt'sy to their will;
	Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite,
	To follow as it draws. I'll to my brother:
	Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,
	Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour,
	That, had he twenty heads to tender down
	On twenty bloody blocks, he'd yield them up,
	Before his sister should her body stoop
	To such abhorr'd pollution.
	Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
	More than our brother is our chastity.
	I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
	And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.
<SPEECH 66><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	</STAGE DIR> What ho! Peace here; grace and good company!
<SPEECH 67><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	My business is a word or two with Claudio.
<SPEECH 68><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Why, as all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.
	Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
	Intends you for his swift ambassador,
	Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:
	Therefore, your best appointment make with speed;
	To-morrow you set on.
<SPEECH 69><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	None, but such remedy, as to save a head
	To cleave a heart in twain.
<SPEECH 70><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Yes, brother, you may live:
	There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
	If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
	But fetter you till death.
<SPEECH 71><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
	Though all the world's vastidity you had,
	To a determin'd scope.
<SPEECH 72><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	In such a one as, you consenting to't,
	Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
	And leave you naked.
<SPEECH 73><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
	Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
	And six or seven winters more respect
	Than a perpetual honour. Dar'st thou die?
	The sense of death is most in apprehension,
	And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
	In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
	As when a giant dies.
<SPEECH 74><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	There spake my brother: there my father's grave
	Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
	Thou art too noble to conserve a life
	In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
	Whose settled visage and deliberate word
	Nips youth i' the head, and follies doth enmew
	As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil;
	His filth within being cast, he would appear
	A pond as deep as hell.
<SPEECH 75><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
	The damned'st body to invest and cover
	In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?
	If I would yield him my virginity,
	Thou mightst be freed.
<SPEECH 76><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
	So to offend him still. This night's the time
	That I should do what I abhor to name,
	Or else thou diest to-morrow.
<SPEECH 77><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	O! were it but my life,
	I'd throw it down for your deliverance
	As frankly as a pin.
<SPEECH 78><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Be ready, Claudio, for your death to-morrow.
<SPEECH 79><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Which is the least?
<SPEECH 80><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	What says my brother?
<SPEECH 81><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	And shamed life a hateful.
<SPEECH 82><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Alas! alas!
<SPEECH 83><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	O you beast!
	O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
	Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
	Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
	From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
	Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair;
	For such a warped slip of wilderness
	Ne'er issu'd from his blood. Take my defiance;
	Die, perish! Might but my bending down
	Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed.
	I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
	No word to save thee.
<SPEECH 84><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	O, fie, fie, fie!
	Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
	Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:
	'Tis best that thou diest quickly.
<SPEECH 85><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	What is your will?
<SPEECH 86><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	I have no superfluous leisure: my stay must be stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you a while.
<SPEECH 87><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	I am now going to resolve him; I had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born. But O, how much is the good duke deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can speak to him. I will open my lips in vain, or discover his government.
<SPEECH 88><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Let me hear you speak further. I have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.
<SPEECH 89><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.
<SPEECH 90><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?
<SPEECH 91><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world! What corruption in this life, that it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?
<SPEECH 92><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	Show me how, good father.
<SPEECH 93><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	The image of it gives me content already, and I trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.
<SPEECH 94><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.
<SPEECH 95><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	He hath a garden circummur'd with brick,
	Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
	And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
	That makes his opening with this bigger key;
	This other doth command a little door
	Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
	There have I made my promise
	Upon the heavy middle of the night
	To call upon him.
<SPEECH 96><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:
	With whispering and most guilty diligence,
	In action all of precept, he did show me
	The way twice o'er.
<SPEECH 97><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;
	And that I have possess'd him my most stay
	Can be but brief; for I have made him know
	I have a servant comes with me along,
	That stays upon me, whose persuasion is
	I come about my brother.
<SPEECH 98><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	I do desire the like.
<SPEECH 99><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
	If you advise it.
<SPEECH 100><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	Little have you to say

	</STAGE DIR> Peace, ho, be here!
<SPEECH 102><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	Ho! by your leave.
<SPEECH 103><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	The better, given me by so holy a man.
	Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?
<SPEECH 104><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	Nay, but it is not so.
<SPEECH 105><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	O! I will to him and pluck out his eyes!
<SPEECH 106><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	Unhappy Claudio! Wretched Isabel!
	Injurious world! Most damned Angelo!
<SPEECH 107><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
	I am directed by you.
<SPEECH 108><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
	To speak so indirectly I am loath:
	I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,
	That is your part: yet I'm advis'd to do it;
	He says, to veil full purpose.
<SPEECH 109><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
	Besides, he tells me that if peradventure
	He speak against me on the adverse side,
	I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic
	That's bitter to sweet end.
<SPEECH 110><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
	O, peace! the friar is come.
<SPEECH 111><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
	Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard
	Upon a wrong'd, I'd fain have said, a maid!
	O worthy prince! dishonour not your eye
	By throwing it on any other object
	Till you have heard me in my true complaint
	And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!
<SPEECH 112><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	O worthy duke!
	You bid me seek redemption of the devil.
	Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
	Must either punish me, not being believ'd,
	Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O, hear me, here!
<SPEECH 113><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	By course of justice!
<SPEECH 114><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak.
	That Angelo's forsworn, is it not strange?
	That Angelo's a murderer, is't not strange?
	That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
	A hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
	Is it not strange, and strange?
<SPEECH 115><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	It is not truer he is Angelo
	Than this is all as true as it is strange;
	Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
	To the end of reckoning.
<SPEECH 116><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believ'st
	There is another comfort than this world,
	That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
	That I am touch'd with madness. Make not impossible
	That which but seems unlike. 'Tis not impossible
	But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
	May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
	As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
	In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
	Be an arch-villain. Believe it, royal prince:
	If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
	Had I more name for badness.
<SPEECH 117><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	O gracious duke!
	Harp not on that; nor do not banish reason
	For inequality; but let your reason serve
	To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
	And hide the false seems true.
<SPEECH 118><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	I am the sister of one Claudio,
	Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
	To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo.
	I, in probation of a sisterhood,
	Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
	As then the messenger,—
<SPEECH 119><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	That's he indeed.
<SPEECH 120><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,—
<SPEECH 121><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	I went
	To this pernicious caitiff deputy.
<SPEECH 122><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	Pardon it;
	The phrase is to the matter.
<SPEECH 123><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	In brief, to set the needless process by,
	How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
	How he refell'd me, and how I replied,—
	For this was of much length,—the vile conclusion
	I now begin with grief and shame to utter.
	He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
	To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
	Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
	My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
	And I did yield to him. But the next morn betimes,
	His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
	For my poor brother's head.
<SPEECH 124><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	O, that it were as like as it is true!
<SPEECH 125><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	And is this all?
	Then, O you blessed ministers above,
	Keep me in patience; and, with ripen'd time
	Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
	In countenance! Heaven shield your Grace from woe,
	As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!

	One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.
<SPEECH 127><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
	O, give me pardon,
	That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd
	Your unknown sovereignty!
<SPEECH 128><ACT 5><SCENE 1><95%>
	I do, my lord.
<SPEECH 129><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
	</STAGE DIR> Most bounteous sir,
	Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
	As if my brother liv'd. I partly think
	A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
	Till he did look on me: since it is so,
	Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
	In that he did the thing for which he died:
	For Angelo,
	His act did not o'ertake his bad intent;
	And must be buried but as an intent
	That perish'd by the way. Thoughts are no subjects;
	Intents but merely thoughts.
