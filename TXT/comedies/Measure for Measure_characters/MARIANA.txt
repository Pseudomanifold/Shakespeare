	Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:
	Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
	Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.
	I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish
	You had not found me here so musical:
	Let me excuse me, and believe me so,
	My mirth it much displeas'd, but pleas'd my woe.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	You have not been inquired after: I have sat here all day.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	I am always bound to you.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	Good friar, I know you do, and oft have found it.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	Will't please you walk aside?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	Fear me not.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
	Be rul'd by him.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
	I would, Friar Peter—
<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face
	Until my husband bid me.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	No, my lord.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	No, my lord.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Neither, my lord.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	My lord, I do confess I ne'er was married;
	And I confess besides I am no maid:
	I have known my husband yet my husband knows not
	That ever he knew me.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Now I come to't, my lord:
	She that accuses him of fornication,
	In self-same manner doth accuse my husband;
	And charges him, my lord, with such a time,
	When, I'll depose, I had him in mine arms,
	With all th' effect of love.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Not that I know.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
	Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body
	But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
	This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
	Which once thou swor'st was worth the looking on:
	This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
	Was fast belock'd in thine: this is the body
	That took away the match from Isabel,
	And did supply thee at thy garden-house
	In her imagin'd person.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	Noble prince,
	As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
	As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
	I am affianc'd this man's wife as strongly
	As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,
	But Tuesday night last gone in 's garden-house
	He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
	Let me in safety raise me from my knees
	Or else for ever be confixed here,
	A marble monument.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 1><95%>
	O, my most gracious lord!
	I hope you will not mock me with a husband.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
	O my dear lord!
	I crave no other, nor no better man.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
	</STAGE DIR> Gentle my liege,—
<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
	O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part:
	Lend me your knees, and, all my life to come,
	I'll lend you all my life to do you service,
<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
	Isabel,
	Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me:
	Hold up your hands, say nothing, I'll speak all.
	They say best men are moulded out of faults,
	And, for the most, become much more the better
	For being a little bad: so may my husband.
	O, Isabel! will you not lend a knee?
<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
	Merely, my lord.
