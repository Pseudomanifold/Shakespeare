	It shall be speeded well.

	Come; I have found you out a stand most fit,
	Where you may have such vantage on the duke,
	He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded:
	The generous and gravest citizens
	Have hent the gates, and very near upon
	The duke is ent'ring: therefore hence, away!
<SPEECH 3><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
	Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	Bless'd be your royal Grace!
	I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
	Your royal ear abus'd. First, hath this woman
	Most wrongfully accus'd your substitute,
	Who is as free from touch or soil with her,
	As she from one ungot.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	I know him for a man divine and holy;
	Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
	As he's reported by this gentleman;
	And, on my trust, a man that never yet
	Did, as he vouches, misreport your Grace.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	Well; he in time may come to clear himself,
	But at this instant he is sick, my lord,
	Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,
	Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
	Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,
	To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
	Is true and false; and what he with his oath
	And all probation will make up full clear,
	Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman,
	To justify this worthy nobleman,
	So vulgarly and personally accus'd,
	Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
	Till she herself confess it.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	Would he were here, my lord; for he indeed
	Hath set the women on to this complaint:
	Your provost knows the place where he abides
	And he may fetch him.
