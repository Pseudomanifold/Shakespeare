	I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so:
	Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,
	Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
	But fare thee well; there is a ducat for thee:
	And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see
	Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest:
	Give him this letter; do it secretly;
	And so farewell: I would not have my father
	See me in talk with thee.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 3><29%>
	Farewell, good Launcelot.
	Alack, what heinous sin is it in me
	To be asham'd to be my father's child!
	But though I am a daughter to his blood,
	I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo!
	If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,
	Become a Christian, and thy loving wife.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 5><32%>
	Call you? What is your will?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 5><33%>
	His words were, 'Farewell, mistress;' nothing else.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 5><33%>
	Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,
	I have a father, you a daughter, lost.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
	Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	Lorenzo, certain; and my love indeed,
	For whom love I so much? And now who knows
	But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
	I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,
	For I am much asham'd of my exchange;
	But love is blind, and lovers cannot see
	The pretty follies that themselves commit;
	For if they could, Cupid himself would blush
	To see me thus transformed to a boy.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	What! must I hold a candle to my shames?
	They in themselves, good sooth, are too-too light.
	Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love,
	And I should be obscur'd.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 6><36%>
	I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
	With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 2><60%>
	When I was with him, I have heard him swear
	To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,
	That he would rather have Antonio's flesh
	Than twenty times the value of the sum
	That he did owe him; and I know, my lord,
	If law, authority, and power deny not,
	It will go hard with poor Antonio.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 4><65%>
	I wish your ladyship all heart's content.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 5><67%>
	And what hope is that, I pray thee?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 5><67%>
	That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 5><67%>
	I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a Christian.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 5><68%>
	I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 5><68%>
	Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for, in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the price of pork.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 5><69%>
	Past all expressing. It is very meet,
	The Lord Bassanio live an upright life,
	For, having such a blessing in his lady,
	He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;
	And if on earth he do not mean it, then
	In reason he should never come to heaven.
	Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match,
	And on the wager lay two earthly women,
	And Portia one, there must be something else
	Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world
	Hath not her fellow.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 5><70%>
	Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 5><70%>
	Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 5><70%>
	Well, I'll set you forth.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	In such a night
	Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew,
	And saw the lion's shadow ere himself,
	And ran dismay'd away.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	In such a night
	Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs
	That did renew old Ã†son.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	In such a night
	Did young Lorenzo swear he lov'd her well,
	Stealing her soul with many vows of faith,
	And ne'er a true one.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	I would out-night you, did no body come;
	But, hark! I hear the footing of a man.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
