	Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
	There, where your argosies with portly sail,—
	Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
	Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,—
	Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
	That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
	As they fly by them with their woven wings.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	My wind, cooling my broth,
	Would blow me to an ague, when I thought
	What harm a wind too great might do at sea.
	I should not see the sandy hour-glass run
	But I should think of shallows and of flats,
	And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand
	Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
	To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
	And see the holy edifice of stone,
	And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
	Which touching but my gentle vessel's side
	Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
	Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks;
	And, in a word, but even now worth this,
	And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
	To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
	That such a thing bechanc'd would make me sad?
	But tell not me: I know Antonio
	Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Why, then you are in love.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Not in love neither? Then let's say you are sad,
	Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy
	For you to laugh and leap, and say you are merry,
	Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
	Nature hath fram'd strange fellows in her time:
	Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
	And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,
	And other of such vinegar aspect
	That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,
	Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,
	If worthier friends had not prevented me.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Good morrow, my good lords.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
	We have not spoke us yet of torch-bearers.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 4><31%>
	Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 4><31%>
	'Tis good we do so.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
	His hour is almost past.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
	O! ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
	To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are wont
	To keep obliged faith unforfeited!
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
	Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 8><39%>
	Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:
	With him is Gratiano gone along;
	And in their ship I'm sure Lorenzo is not.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 8><40%>
	He came too late, the ship was under sail:
	But there the duke was given to understand
	That in a gondola were seen together
	Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica.
	Besides, Antonio certified the duke
	They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 8><40%>
	Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
	Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 8><40%>
	Marry, well remember'd.
	I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,
	Who told me,—in the narrow seas that part
	The French and English,—there miscarried
	A vessel of our country richly fraught.
	I thought upon Antonio when he told me,
	And wish'd in silence that it were not his.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 8><41%>
	A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
	I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:
	Bassanio told him he would make some speed
	Of his return: he answer'd 'Do not so;
	Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio,
	But stay the very riping of the time;
	And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,
	Let it not enter in your mind of love:
	Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts
	To courtship and such fair ostents of love
	As shall conveniently become you there:'
	And even there, his eye being big with tears,
	Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,
	And with affection wondrous sensible
	He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 8><41%>
	Do we so.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Why, yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wracked on the narrow seas; the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very dangerous flat, and fatal, where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip Report be an honest woman of her word.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	Come, the full stop.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	I would it might prove the end of his losses.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no?
<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Why, I am sure, if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh: what's that good for?
<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	We have been up and down to seek him.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 3><63%>
	It is the most impenetrable cur
	That ever kept with men.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 3><63%>
	I am sure the duke
	Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	He's ready at the door: he comes, my lord.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 1><74%>
	My lord, here stays without
	A messenger with letters from the doctor,
	New come from Padua.
