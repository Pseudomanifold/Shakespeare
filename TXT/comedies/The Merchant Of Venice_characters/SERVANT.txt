	Where is my lady?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><45%>
	Madam, there is alighted at your gate
	A young Venetian, one that comes before
	To signify the approaching of his lord;
	From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,
	To wit, — besides commends and courteous breath,—
	Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
	So likely an embassador of love.
	A day in April never came so sweet,
	To show how costly summer was at hand,
	As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to speak with you both.
