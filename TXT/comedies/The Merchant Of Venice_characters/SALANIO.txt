	Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
	The better part of my affections would
	Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
	Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind;
	Peering in maps for ports, and piers, and roads;
	And every object that might make me fear
	Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
	Would make me sad.

	Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,
	Gratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:
	We leave you now with better company.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
	'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd,
	And better, in my mind, not undertook.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 4><31%>
	And so will I.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 8><40%>
	The villain Jew with outcries rais'd the duke,
	Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 8><40%>
	I never heard a passion so confus'd,
	So strange, outrageous, and so variable,
	As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:
	'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!
	Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!
	Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!
	A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
	Of double ducats, stol'n from me by my daughter!
	And jewels! two stones, two rich and precious stones,
	Stol'n by my daughter! Justice! find the girl!
	She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'

	Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
	Or he shall pay for this.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 8><41%>
	You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
	Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 8><41%>
	I think he only loves the world for him.
	I pray thee, let us go and find him out,
	And quicken his embraced heaviness
	With some delight or other.

	Now, what news on the Rialto?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger, or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband. But it is true,—without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk,—that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio,—O, that I had a title good enough to keep his name company!—
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	Ha! what sayst thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a ship.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.
	How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	I did, my lord,
	And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio
	Commends him to you.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
	Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
	Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there
	Will show you his estate.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
	I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 2><60%>
	Not one, my lord.
	Besides, it should appear, that if he had
	The present money to discharge the Jew,
	He would not take it. Never did I know
	A creature, that did bear the shape of man,
	So keen and greedy to confound a man.
	He plies the duke at morning and at night,
	And doth impeach the freedom of the state,
	If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,
	The duke himself, and the magnificoes
	Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;
	But none can drive him from the envious plea
	Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.
