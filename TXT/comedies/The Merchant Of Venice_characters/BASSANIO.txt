	Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find them, and, when you have them, they are not worth the search.

	'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
	How much I have disabled mine estate,
	By something showing a more swelling port
	Than my faint means would grant continuance:
	Nor do I now make moan to be abridg'd
	From such a noble rate; but my chief care
	Is, to come fairly off from the great debts
	Wherein my time, something too prodigal,
	Hath left me gag'd. To you, Antonio,
	I owe the most, in money and in love;
	And from your love I have a warranty
	To unburthen all my plots and purposes
	How to get clear of all the debts I owe.

	In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
	I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
	The self-same way with more advised watch,
	To find the other forth, and by adventuring both,
	I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof,
	Because what follows is pure innocence.
	I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,
	That which I owe is lost; but if you please
	To shoot another arrow that self way
	Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
	As I will watch the aim, or to find both,
	Or bring your latter hazard back again,
	And thankfully rest debtor for the first.

	In Belmont is a lady richly left,
	And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
	Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
	I did receive fair speechless messages:
	Her name is Portia; nothing undervalu'd
	To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:
	Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
	For the four winds blow in from every coast
	Renowned suitors; and her sunny locks
	Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
	Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strond,
	And many Jasons come in quest of her.
	O my Antonio! had I but the means
	To hold a rival place with one of them,
	I have a mind presages me such thrift,
	That I should questionless be fortunate.

	Why, then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano;

	Parts that become thee happily enough,
	And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;
	But where thou art not known, why, there they show
	Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain
	To allay with some cold drops of modesty
	Thy skipping spirit, lest, through thy wild behaviour,
	I be misconstru'd in the place I go to,
	And lose my hopes.

	'Confess' and 'love'

<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	So may the outward shows be least themselves:
	The world is still deceiv'd with ornament.
	In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt
	But, being season'd with a gracious voice,
	Obscures the show of evil? In religion,
	What damned error, but some sober brow
	Will bless it and approve it with a text,
	Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
	There is no vice so simple but assumes
	Some mark of virtue on his outward parts.
	How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false
	As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins
	The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,
	Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;
	And these assume but valour's excrement
	To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,
	And you shall see 'tis purchas'd by the weight;
	Which therein works a miracle in nature,
	Making them lightest that wear most of it:
	So are those crisped snaky golden locks
	Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,
	Upon supposed fairness, often known
	To be the dowry of a second head,
	The skull that bred them, in the sepulchre.
	Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
	To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
	Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,
	The seeming truth which cunning times put on
	To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
	Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;
	Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
	'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,
	Which rather threat'nest than dost promise aught,
	Thy plainness moves me more than eloquence,
	And here choose I: joy be the consequence!
<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	What find I here?
	Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god
	Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?
	Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,
	Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,
	Parted with sugar breath; so sweet a bar
	Should sunder such sweet friends. Here, in her hairs
	The painter plays the spider, and hath woven
	A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men
	Faster than gnats in cobwebs: but her eyes!—
	How could he see to do them? having made one,
	Methinks it should have power to steal both his
	And leave itself unfurnish'd: yet look, how far
	The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
	In underprizing it, so far this shadow
	Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,
	The continent and summary of my fortune.
	You that choose not by the view,
	Chance as fair and choose as true!
	Since this fortune falls to you,
	Be content and seek no new.
	If you be well pleas'd with this
	And hold your fortune for your bliss,
	Turn you where your lady is
	And claim her with a loving kiss.
	A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
	I come by note, to give and to receive.
	Like one of two contending in a prize,
	That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,
	Hearing applause and universal shout,
	Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
	Whether those peals of praise be his or no;
	So, thrice-fair lady, stand I, even so,
	As doubtful whether what I see be true,
	Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
	Madam, you have bereft me of all words,
	Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
	And there is such confusion in my powers,
	As, after some oration fairly spoke
	By a beloved prince, there doth appear
	Among the buzzing pleased multitude;
	Where every something, being blent together,
	Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,
	Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
	Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:
	O! then be bold to say Bassanio's dead.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.

<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	Ere I ope his letter,
	I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
	O sweet Portia!
	Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
	That ever blotted paper. Gentle lady,
	When I did first impart my love to you,
	I freely told you all the wealth I had
	Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman:
	And then I told you true; and yet, dear lady,
	Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
	How much I was a braggart. When I told you
	My state was nothing, I should then have told you
	That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,
	I have engag'd myself to a dear friend,
	Engag'd my friend to his mere enemy,
	To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;
	The paper as the body of my friend,
	And every word in it a gaping wound,
	Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salanio?
	Hath all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?
	From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,
	From Lisbon, Barbary, and India?
	And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch
	Of merchant-marring rocks?
<SPEECH 42><ACT 3><SCENE 2><61%>
	The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
	The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit
	In doing courtesies, and one in whom
	The ancient Roman honour more appears
	Than any that draws breath in Italy.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 2><61%>
	For me, three thousand ducats.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 2><61%>
	Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since, in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 2><62%>
	Since I have your good leave to go away,
	I will make haste; but, till I come again,
	No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,
	Nor rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
	To excuse the current of thy cruelty.

	For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 4><SCENE 1><74%>
	Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!
	The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all,
	Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 4><SCENE 1><75%>
	Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
<SPEECH 52><ACT 4><SCENE 1><78%>
	Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
	Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
	I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
	On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.
	If this will not suffice, it must appear
	That malice bears down truth. And, I beseech you,
	Wrest once the law to your authority:
	To do a great right, do a little wrong,
	And curb this cruel devil of his will.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 4><SCENE 1><81%>
	Antonio, I am married to a wife
	Which is as dear to me as life itself;
	But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
	Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:

	Here to this devil, to deliver you.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 4><SCENE 1><82%>
	Here is the money.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 4><SCENE 1><83%>

	Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend

<SPEECH 57><ACT 4><SCENE 1><86%>
	Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:
	Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,
	Not as a fee. Grant me two things, I pray you,
	Not to deny me, and to pardon me.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 4><SCENE 1><86%>
	This ring, good sir? alas! it is a trifle;
	I will not shame myself to give you this.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 4><SCENE 1><86%>
	There's more depends on this than on the value.
	The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,
	And find it out by proclamation:
	Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.
<SPEECH 60><ACT 4><SCENE 1><87%>
	Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
	And, when she put it on, she made me vow
	That I should never sell nor give nor lose it.
<SPEECH 61><ACT 4><SCENE 1><87%>
	Go, Gratiano; run and overtake him;
	Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,

	Fly toward Belmont. Come, Antonio.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>

	</STAGE DIR> Why, I were best to cut my left hand off,

	Sweet Portia,
	If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
	If you did know for whom I gave the ring,
	And would conceive for what I gave the ring,
	And how unwillingly I left the ring,
	When naught would be accepted but the ring,
	You would abate the strength of your displeasure.
<SPEECH 67><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
	No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
	No woman had it; but a civil doctor,
	Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me,
	And begg'd the ring, the which I did deny him,
	And suffer'd him to go displeas'd away;
	Even he that did uphold the very life
	Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?
	I was enforc'd to send it after him;
	I was beset with shame and courtesy;
	My honour would not let ingratitude
	So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady,
	For, by these blessed candles of the night,
	Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd
	The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
<SPEECH 68><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
	Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
	And in the hearing of these many friends,
	I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
	Wherein I see myself,—
<SPEECH 69><ACT 5><SCENE 1><98%>
	Nay, but hear me:
	Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
	I never more will break an oath with thee.
