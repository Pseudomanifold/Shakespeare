<ACT 1>


<SCENE 1>
<Rousillon. A Room in the Countess's Palace.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Bertram, the Countess of Rousillon, Helena, and Lafeu, all in black.>
</STAGE DIR>
<COUNTESS>	<0%>
	In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.
</COUNTESS>

<BERTRAM>	<0%>
	And I, in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew; but I must attend his majesty's command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.
</BERTRAM>

<LAFEU>	<1%>
	You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you, sir, a father. He that so generally is at all times good, must of necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance.
</LAFEU>

<COUNTESS>	<1%>
	What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?
</COUNTESS>

<LAFEU>	<1%>
	He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.
</LAFEU>

<COUNTESS>	<1%>
	This young gentlewoman had a father,—O, that 'had!' how sad a passage 'tis!—whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for the king's sake, he were living! I think it would be the death of the king's disease.
</COUNTESS>

<LAFEU>	<1%>
	How called you the man you speak of, madam?
</LAFEU>

<COUNTESS>	<1%>
	He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.
</COUNTESS>

<LAFEU>	<1%>
	He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly. He was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.
</LAFEU>

<BERTRAM>	<1%>
	What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?
</BERTRAM>

<LAFEU>	<1%>
	A fistula, my lord.
</LAFEU>

<BERTRAM>	<2%>
	I heard not of it before.
</BERTRAM>

<LAFEU>	<2%>
	I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
</LAFEU>

<COUNTESS>	<2%>
	His sole child, my lord; and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education promises: her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity; they are virtues and traitors too: in her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.
</COUNTESS>

<LAFEU>	<2%>
	Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
</LAFEU>

<COUNTESS>	<2%>
	'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena, go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow, than have it.
</COUNTESS>

<HELENA>	<2%>
	I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
</HELENA>

<LAFEU>	<2%>
	Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead, excessive grief the enemy to the living.
</LAFEU>

<HELENA>	<2%>
	If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal.
</HELENA>

<BERTRAM>	<2%>
	Madam, I desire your holy wishes.
</BERTRAM>

<LAFEU>	<2%>
	How understand we that?
</LAFEU>

<COUNTESS>	<2%>
	Be thou blest, Bertram; and succeed thy father
	In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
	Contend for empire in thee; and thy goodness
	Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
	Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
	Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
	Under thy own life's key: be check'd for silence,
	But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will
	That thee may furnish, and my prayers pluck down,
	Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;
	'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
	Advise him.
</COUNTESS>

<LAFEU>	<3%>
	He cannot want the best
	That shall attend his love.
</LAFEU>

<COUNTESS>	<3%>
	Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.
</COUNTESS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<BERTRAM>	<3%>
<STAGE DIR>
<To Helena.>
</STAGE DIR> The best wishes that can be forged in your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.
</BERTRAM>

<LAFEU>	<3%>
	Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of your father.
</LAFEU>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Bertram and Lafeu.>
</STAGE DIR>

<HELENA>	<3%>
	O! were that all. I think not on my father;
	And these great tears grace his remembrance more
	Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
	I have forgot him: my imagination
	Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
	I am undone: there is no living, none,
	If Bertram be away. It were all one
	That I should love a bright particular star
	And think to wed it, he is so above me:
	In his bright radiance and collateral light
	Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
	The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
	The hind that would be mated by the lion
	Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
	To see him every hour; to sit and draw
	His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
	In our heart's table; heart too capable
	Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:
	But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
	Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?
	One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;
	And yet I know him a notorious liar,
	Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;
	Yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him,
	That they take place, when virtue's steely bones
	Look bleak in the cold wind: withal, full oft we see
	Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.

</HELENA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Parolles.>
</STAGE DIR>
<PAROLLES>	<4%>
	Save you, fair queen!
</PAROLLES>

<HELENA>	<4%>
	And you, monarch!
</HELENA>

<PAROLLES>	<4%>
	No.
</PAROLLES>

<HELENA>	<4%>
	And no.
</HELENA>

<PAROLLES>	<4%>
	Are you meditating on virginity?
</PAROLLES>

<HELENA>	<4%>
	Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it against him?
</HELENA>

<PAROLLES>	<4%>
	Keep him out.
</PAROLLES>

<HELENA>	<4%>
	But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant in the defence, yet is weak. Unfold to us some war-like resistance.
</HELENA>

<PAROLLES>	<4%>
	There is none: man, sitting down before you, will undermine you and blow you up.
</PAROLLES>

<HELENA>	<4%>
	Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up! Is there no military policy, how virgins might blow up men?
</HELENA>

<PAROLLES>	<4%>
	Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up: marry in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity, by being once lost, may be ten times found: by being ever kept, it is ever lost.'Tis too cold a companion: away with't!
</PAROLLES>

<HELENA>	<5%>
	I will stand for't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.
</HELENA>

<PAROLLES>	<5%>
	There's little can be said in't; 'tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity murders itself, and should be buried in highways, out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by't! Out with't! within the year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the principal itself not much the worse. Away with't!
</PAROLLES>

<HELENA>	<5%>
	How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
</HELENA>

<PAROLLES>	<5%>
	Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it likes. 'Tis a commodity that will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with't, while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion; richly suited, but unsuitable: just like the brooch and the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek: and your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French withered pears; it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, 'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet 'tis a withered pear. Will you anything with it?
</PAROLLES>

<HELENA>	<6%>
	Not my virginity yet.
	There shall your master have a thousand loves,
	A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,
	A phœnix, captain, and an enemy,
	A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
	A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;
	His humble ambition, proud humility,
	His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
	His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world
	Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,
	That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he—
	I know not what he shall. God send him well!
	The court's a learning-place, and he is one—
</HELENA>

<PAROLLES>	<6%>
	What one, i' faith?
</PAROLLES>

<HELENA>	<6%>
	That I wish well. 'Tis pity—
</HELENA>

<PAROLLES>	<6%>
	What's pity?
</PAROLLES>

<HELENA>	<6%>
	That wishing well had not a body in't,
	Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
	Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
	Might with effects of them follow our friends,
	And show what we alone must think, which never
	Returns us thanks.

	Little Helen, farewell: if I can remember thee, I will think of thee at court.
</PAROLLES>

<HELENA>	<7%>
	Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.
</HELENA>

<PAROLLES>	<7%>
	Under Mars, I.
</PAROLLES>

<HELENA>	<7%>
	I especially think, under Mars.
</HELENA>

	Why under Mars?
</PAROLLES>

	The wars have so kept you under that you must needs be born under Mars.

<PAROLLES>	<7%>
	Why think you so?
</PAROLLES>

<HELENA>	<7%>
	You go so much backward when you fight.
</HELENA>

<PAROLLES>	<7%>
	That's for advantage.
</PAROLLES>

<HELENA>	<7%>
	So is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.
</HELENA>

<PAROLLES>	<7%>
	I am so full of businesses I cannot answer thee acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's counsel, and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good husband, and use him as he uses thee: so, farewell.

	Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie
	Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky
	Gives us free scope; only doth backward pull
	Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
	What power is it which mounts my love so high;
	That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
	The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
	To join like likes, and kiss like native things.
	Impossible be strange attempts to those
	That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose
	What hath been cannot be: who ever strove
	To show her merit, that did miss her love?
	The king's disease,—my project may deceive me,
	But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.

	So 'tis reported, sir.
</LORD 1>

<KING>	<8%>
	Nay, 'tis most credible: we here receive it

	It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,

</LORD 1>

<KING>	<9%>
	Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
	Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
	Hath well compos'd thee. Thy father's moral parts
	Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.
</KING>

<BERTRAM>	<9%>
	My thanks and duty are your majesty's.
</BERTRAM>

<KING>	<9%>
	I would I had that corporal soundness now,
	As when thy father and myself in friendship
	First tried our soldiership! He did look far
	Into the service of the time and was
	Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;
	But on us both did haggish age steal on,
	And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
	To talk of your good father. In his youth
	He had the wit which I can well observe
	To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
	Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
	Ere they can hide their levity in honour.
	So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness
	Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
	His equal had awak'd them; and his honour,
	Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
	Exception bid him speak, and at this time
	His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him
	He us'd as creatures of another place,
	And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
	Making them proud of his humility,
	In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
	Might be a copy to these younger times,
	Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now
	But goers backward.
</KING>

<BERTRAM>	<10%>
	His good remembrance, sir,
	Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
	So in approof lives not his epitaph
	As in your royal speech.
</BERTRAM>

<KING>	<10%>
	Would I were with him! He would always say,—
	Methinks I hear him now: his plausive words
	He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,
	To grow there and to bear. 'Let me not live,'—
	Thus his good melancholy oft began,
	On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
	When it was out,—'Let me not live,' quoth he,
	'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
	Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
	All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
	Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
	Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd:
	I, after him, do after him wish too,
	Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
	I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
	To give some labourers room.
</KING>

<LORD 2>	<10%>
	You are lov'd, sir;

	Some six months since, my lord.
</BERTRAM>

<KING>	<11%>
	If he were living, I would try him yet:
	Lend me an arm: the rest have worn me out
	With several applications: nature and sickness
	Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;
	My son's no dearer.

	I will now hear: what say you of this gentlewoman?
</COUNTESS>

<STEWARD>	<11%>
	Madam, the care I have had to even your content, I wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make foul the clearness of our deservings, when of ourselves we publish them.
</STEWARD>

<COUNTESS>	<11%>
	What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah: the complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours.
</COUNTESS>

<CLOWN>	<11%>
	'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.
</CLOWN>

<COUNTESS>	<11%>
	Well, sir.
</COUNTESS>

<CLOWN>	<11%>
	No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though many of the rich are damned. But, if I may have your ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel the woman and I will do as we may.
</CLOWN>

<COUNTESS>	<12%>
	Wilt thou needs be a beggar?
</COUNTESS>

<CLOWN>	<12%>
	I do beg your good will in this case.
</CLOWN>

<COUNTESS>	<12%>
	In what case?
</COUNTESS>

<CLOWN>	<12%>
	In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no heritage; and I think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue o' my body, for they say barnes are blessings.
</CLOWN>

<COUNTESS>	<12%>
	Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
</COUNTESS>

<CLOWN>	<12%>
	My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.
</CLOWN>

<COUNTESS>	<12%>
	Is this all your worship's reason?

<CLOWN>	<12%>
	Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are.
</CLOWN>

<COUNTESS>	<12%>
	May the world know them?
</COUNTESS>

<CLOWN>	<12%>
	I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry that I may repent.
</CLOWN>

<COUNTESS>	<12%>
	Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.
</COUNTESS>

<CLOWN>	<12%>
	I am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to have friends for my wife's sake.
</CLOWN>

<COUNTESS>	<12%>
	Such friends are thine enemies, knave.
</COUNTESS>

<CLOWN>	<12%>
	You're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of. He that ears my land spares my team, and gives me leave to in the crop: if I be his cuckold, he's my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in marriage; for young Charbon the puritan, and old Poysam the papist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in religion, their heads are both one; they may joul horns together like any deer i' the herd.

<COUNTESS>	<13%>
	Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?
</COUNTESS>

<CLOWN>	<13%>
	A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way:

	For I the ballad will repeat,
	Which men full true shall find;
	Your marriage comes by destiny,
	Your cuckoo sings by kind.

	Fond done, done fond,

	With that she sighed as she stood,
	With that she sighed as she stood,
	And gave this sentence then;
	Among nine bad if one be good,
	Among nine bad if one be good,
	There's yet one good in ten.

<COUNTESS>	<13%>
	What! one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.
</COUNTESS>

<CLOWN>	<13%>
	One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying o' the song. Would God would serve the world so all the year! we'd find no fault with the tithe-woman if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An we might have a good woman born but for every blazing star, or at an earthquake,'twould mend the lottery well: a man may draw his heart out ere a' pluck one.

<COUNTESS>	<14%>
	You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you!
</COUNTESS>

<CLOWN>	<14%>
	That man should be at woman's command, and yet no hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.

<COUNTESS>	<14%>
	Well, now.
</COUNTESS>

<STEWARD>	<14%>
	I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.
</STEWARD>

<COUNTESS>	<14%>
	Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds: there is more owing her than is paid, and more shall be paid her than she'll demand.
</COUNTESS>

<STEWARD>	<14%>
	Madam, I was very late more near her than I think she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son: Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not extend his might, only where qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surprised, without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward. This she delivered in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in; which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal, sithence in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to know it.
</STEWARD>

<COUNTESS>	<15%>
	You have discharged this honestly: keep it to yourself. Many likelihoods informed me of this before, which hung so tottering in the balance that I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you, leave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank you for your honest care. I will speak with you further anon.

<Enter Helena.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Even so it was with me when I was young:
	If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn
	Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;
	Our blood to us, this to our blood is born:
	It is the show and seal of nature's truth,
	Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth:
	By our remembrances of days foregone,
	Such were our faults; or then we thought them none.
</COUNTESS>
	Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.
<HELENA>	<15%>
	What is your pleasure, madam?
</HELENA>

<COUNTESS>	<15%>
	You know, Helen,
	I am a mother to you.
</COUNTESS>

<HELENA>	<15%>
	Mine honourable mistress.
</HELENA>

<COUNTESS>	<15%>
	Nay, a mother:
	Why not a mother? When I said, 'a mother,'
	Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother'
	That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;
	And put you in the catalogue of those
	That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen
	Adoption strives with nature, and choice breeds
	A native slip to us from foreign seeds;
	You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,
	Yet I express to you a mother's care.
	God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
	To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,
	That this distemper'd messenger of wet,
	The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?
	Why? that you are my daughter?
</COUNTESS>

<HELENA>	<16%>
	That I am not.
</HELENA>

<COUNTESS>	<16%>
	I say, I am your mother.
</COUNTESS>

<HELENA>	<16%>
	Pardon, madam;
	The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:
	I am from humble, he from honour'd name;
	No note upon my parents, his all noble:
	My master, my dear lord he is; and I
	His servant live, and will his vassal die.
	He must not be my brother.
</HELENA>

<COUNTESS>	<16%>
	Nor I your mother?
</COUNTESS>

<HELENA>	<16%>
	You are my mother, madam: would you were,—
	So that my lord your son were not my brother,—
	Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,
	I care no more for than I do for heaven,
	So I were not his sister. Can't no other,
	But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?
</HELENA>

<COUNTESS>	<16%>
	Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:
	God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother
	So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?
	My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I see
	The mystery of your loneliness, and find
	Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross
	You love my son: invention is asham'd,
	Against the proclamation of thy passion,
	To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;
	But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look, thy cheeks
	Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes
	See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours
	That in their kind they speak it: only sin
	And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
	That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?
	If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;
	If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee,
	As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
	To tell me truly.
</COUNTESS>

<HELENA>	<17%>
	Good madam, pardon me!
</HELENA>

<COUNTESS>	<17%>
	Do you love my son?
</COUNTESS>

<HELENA>	<17%>
	Your pardon, noble mistress!
</HELENA>

<COUNTESS>	<17%>
	Love you my son?
</COUNTESS>

<HELENA>	<17%>
	Do not you love him, madam?
</HELENA>

<COUNTESS>	<17%>
	Go not about; my love hath in't a bond
	Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose
	The state of your affection, for your passions
	Have to the full appeach'd.
</COUNTESS>

<HELENA>	<17%>
	Then, I confess,
	Here on my knee, before high heaven and you
	That before you, and next unto high heaven,
	I love your son.
	My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:
	Be not offended, for it hurts not him
	That he is lov'd of me: I follow him not
	By any token of presumptuous suit;
	Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;
	Yet never know how that desert should be.
	I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
	Yet, in this captious and intenible sieve
	I still pour in the waters of my love,
	And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,
	Religious in mine error, I adore
	The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,
	But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
	Let not your hate encounter with my love
	For loving where you do: but, if yourself,
	Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,
	Did ever in so true a flame of liking
	Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian
	Was both herself and Love; O! then, give pity
	To her, whose state is such that cannot choose
	But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
	That seeks not to find that her search implies,
	But, riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies.
</HELENA>

<COUNTESS>	<18%>
	Had you not lately an intent, speak truly,
	To go to Paris?
</COUNTESS>

<HELENA>	<18%>
	Madam, I had.
</HELENA>

<COUNTESS>	<18%>
	Wherefore? tell true.
</COUNTESS>

<HELENA>	<18%>
	I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.
	You know my father left me some prescriptions
	Of rare and prov'd effects, such as his reading
	And manifest experience had collected
	For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me
	In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,
	As notes whose faculties inclusive were
	More than they were in note. Amongst the rest,
	There is a remedy, approv'd, set down
	To cure the desperate languishings whereof
	The king is render'd lost.
</HELENA>

<COUNTESS>	<18%>
	This was your motive
	For Paris, was it? speak.
</COUNTESS>

<HELENA>	<18%>
	My lord your son made me to think of this;
	Else Paris, and the medicine, and the king,
	Had from the conversation of my thoughts
	Haply been absent then.
</HELENA>

<COUNTESS>	<18%>
	But think you, Helen,
	If you should tender your supposed aid,
	He would receive it? He and his physicians
	Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,
	They, that they cannot help. How shall they credit
	A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
	Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off
	The danger to itself?
</COUNTESS>

<HELENA>	<19%>
	There's something in't,
	More than my father's skill, which was the great'st
	Of his profession, that his good receipt
	Shall for my legacy be sanctified
	By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour
	But give me leave to try success, I'd venture
	The well-lost life of mine on his Grace's cure,
	By such a day, and hour.
</HELENA>

<COUNTESS>	<19%>
	Dost thou believe't?
</COUNTESS>

<HELENA>	<19%>
	Ay, madam, knowingly.
</HELENA>

<COUNTESS>	<19%>
	Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,
	Means, and attendants, and my loving greetings
	To those of mine in court. I'll stay at home
	And pray God's blessing into thy attempt.
	Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,
	What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.

	Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary

	In this my light deliverance, I have spoke

	I knew him.

<HELENA>	<23%>
	The rather will I spare my praises towards him;
	Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death

	Which, as the dearest issue of his practice,
	And of his old experience the only darling,
	He bade me store up as a triple eye,
	Safer than mine own two, more dear. I have so;
	And, hearing your high majesty is touch'd
	With that malignant cause wherein the honour
	Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,
	I come to tender it and my appliance,
	With all bound humbleness.
</HELENA>

<KING>	<24%>
	We thank you, maiden;
	But may not be so credulous of cure,
	When our most learned doctors leave us, and
	The congregated college have concluded
	That labouring art can never ransom nature
	From her inaidable estate; I say we must not
	So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
	To prostitute our past-cure malady
	To empirics, or to dissever so
	Our great self and our credit, to esteem
	A senseless help when help past sense we deem.
</KING>

<HELENA>	<24%>
	My duty then, shall pay me for my pains:
	I will no more enforce mine office on you;
	Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
	A modest one, to bear me back again.
</HELENA>

<KING>	<24%>
	I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful.
	Thou thought'st to help me, and such thanks I give
	As one near death to those that wish him live;
	But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,
	I knowing all my peril, thou no art.
</KING>

<HELENA>	<24%>
	What I can do can do no hurt to try,
	Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.
	He that of greatest works is finisher
	Oft does them by the weakest minister:
	So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
	When judges have been babes; great floods have flown
	From simple sources; and great seas have dried
	When miracles have by the greatest been denied.
	Oft expectation fails, and most oft there
	Where most it promises; and oft it hits
	Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.
</HELENA>

<KING>	<25%>
	I must not hear thee: fare thee well, kind maid.
	Thy pains, not us'd, must by thyself be paid:

	Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd.
	It is not so with Him that all things knows,
	As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;

	The help of heaven we count the act of men.
	Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
	Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
	I am not an impostor that proclaim
	Myself against the level of mine aim;
	But know I think, and think I know most sure,

	Worth name of life in thee hath estimate;
	Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, virtue, all

	With any branch or image of thy state;
	But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
	Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.
</HELENA>

<KING>	<26%>
	Here is my hand; the premises observ'd,
	Thy will by my performance shall be serv'd:
	So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
	Thy resolv'd patient, on thee still rely.
	More should I question thee, and more I must,
	Though more to know could not be more to trust,
	From whence thou cam'st, how tended on; but rest
	Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.

	From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any question.

<COUNTESS>	<28%>
	Do you cry, 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and 'Spare not me?' Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.

</BERTRAM>

<KING>	<33%>
	Know'st thou not, Bertram,
	What she has done for me?

<BERTRAM>	<33%>
	Yes, my good lord;

</BERTRAM>

	Thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed.
</KING>

<BERTRAM>	<33%>
	But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
	Must answer for your raising? I know her well:
	She had her breeding at my father's charge.
	A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
	Rather corrupt me ever!
</BERTRAM>

<KING>	<33%>
	'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which
	I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
	Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,
	Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
	In differences so mighty. If she be
	All that is virtuous, save what thou dislik'st,
	A poor physician's daughter, thou dislik'st
	Of virtue for the name; but do not so:
	From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
	The place is dignified by the doer's deed:
	Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,
	It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
	Is good without a name: vileness is so:
	The property by what it is should go,
	Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
	In these to nature she's immediate heir,
	And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn
	Which challenges itself as honour's born,
	And is not like the sire: honours thrive
	When rather from our acts we them derive
	Than our foregoers. The mere word's a slave,
	Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave
	A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb
	Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
	Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?
	If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
	I can create the rest: virtue and she
	Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.
</KING>

<BERTRAM>	<34%>
	I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.
</BERTRAM>

<KING>	<34%>
	Thou wrong'st thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose.

<HELENA>	<34%>
	That you are well restor'd, my lord, I'm glad:
	Let the rest go.
</HELENA>

<KING>	<34%>
	My honour's at the stake, which to defeat
	I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
	Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,
	That dost in vile misprision shackle up
	My love and her desert; thou canst not dream
	We, poising us in her defective scale,
	Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,
	It is in us to plant thine honour where
	We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt:
	Obey our will, which travails in thy good:
	Believe not thy disdain, but presently
	Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
	Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
	Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
	Into the staggers and the careless lapse
	Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
	Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,
	Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.
</KING>

<BERTRAM>	<35%>
	Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
	My fancy to your eyes. When I consider
	What great creation and what dole of honour
	Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late
	Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now
	The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,
	Is, as 'twere, born so.
</BERTRAM>

<KING>	<35%>
	Take her by the hand,
	And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise
	A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
	A balance more replete.
</KING>

<BERTRAM>	<35%>
	I take her hand.
</BERTRAM>

<KING>	<35%>
	Good fortune and the favour of the king
	Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
	Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
	And be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast

	Expecting absent friends. As thou lov'st her,

	So that you had her wrinkles, and I her money, I would she did as you say.
</CLOWN>

<PAROLLES>	<40%>
	Why, I say nothing.
</PAROLLES>

<CLOWN>	<40%>
	Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's tongue shakes out his master's undoing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which is within a very little of nothing.

	Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.

	A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.
	Madam, my lord will go away to-night;
	A very serious business calls on him.
	The great prerogative and rite of love,
	Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge,
	But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;
	Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,
	Which they distil now in the curbed time,
	To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy,
	And pleasure drown the brim.
</PAROLLES>

<HELENA>	<41%>
	What's his will else?
</HELENA>

<PAROLLES>	<41%>
	That you will take your instant leave o' the king,
	And make this haste as your own good proceeding,
	Strengthen'd with what apology you think
	May make it probable need.
</PAROLLES>

<HELENA>	<41%>
	What more commands he?
</HELENA>

<PAROLLES>	<41%>
	That, having this obtain'd, you presently

	It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.

Trust him not in matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur: I have spoken better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.

	You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,

	For such a business; therefore am I found
	So much unsettled. This drives me to entreat you
	That presently you take your way for home;

	Look on his letter, madam; here's my passport.
	When thou canst get the ring upon my finger, which never shall come off, and show me a child begotten of thy body that I am father to, then call me husband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.'
	This is a dreadful sentence.

	Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,
	Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
	As oft it loses all: I will be gone;
	My being here it is that holds thee hence:
	Shall I stay here to do't? no, no, although

	His name with zealous fervour sanctify:
	His taken labours bid him me forgive;
	I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth

	Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
	That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief,
	Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
	Dispatch the most convenient messenger:
	When haply he shall hear that she is gone,

	Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,

<MARIANA>	<53%>
	I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid hath been seduced by them; and the misery is, example, that so terrible shows in the wrack of maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but I hope your own grace will keep you where you are, though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost.
</MARIANA>

	Do you think I am so far deceived in him?
</BERTRAM>

<LORD 1>	<56%>
	Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship's entertainment.
</LORD 1>

<LORD 2>	<56%>
	It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.
</LORD 2>

<BERTRAM>	<56%>
	I would I knew in what particular action to try him.
</BERTRAM>

<LORD 2>	<57%>
	None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.
</LORD 2>

<LORD 1>	<57%>
	I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly surprise him: such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy. We will bind and hood wink him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship present at his examination: if he do not, for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my judgment in anything.
</LORD 1>

<LORD 2>	<57%>
	O! for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum: he says he has a stratagem for't. When your lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted, if you give him not John Drum's entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. Here he comes.
</LORD 2>

<LORD 1>	<57%>

	A pox on't! let it go: 'tis but a drum.
</LORD 2>

<PAROLLES>	<57%>
	'But a drum!' Is't 'but a drum?' A drum so lost! There was excellent command, to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!
</PAROLLES>

<LORD 2>	<58%>
	That was not to be blamed in the command of the service: it was a disaster of war that Cæsar himself could not have prevented if he had been there to command.
</LORD 2>

<BERTRAM>	<58%>
	Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not to be recovered.
</BERTRAM>

<PAROLLES>	<58%>
	It might have been recovered.
</PAROLLES>

<BERTRAM>	<58%>
	It might; but it is not now.
</BERTRAM>

<PAROLLES>	<58%>
	It is to be recovered. But that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, I would have that drum or another, or hic jacet.

<BERTRAM>	<58%>
	Why, if you have a stomach to't, monsieur, if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into its native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it, and extend to you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness.
</BERTRAM>

<PAROLLES>	<58%>
	By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.

	You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it is, that he will steal himself into a man's favour, and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but when you find him out you have him ever after.

	Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto?

<HELENA>	<60%>
	Nor would I wish you.
	First, give me trust, the county is my husband,
	And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
	Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,
	By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,
	Err in bestowing it.
</HELENA>

<WIDOW>	<60%>
	I should believe you:
	For you have show'd me that which well approves
	You're great in fortune.

<HELENA>	<61%>
	Take this purse of gold,
	And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
	Which I will over-pay and pay again
	When I have found it. The county woos your daughter,
	Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
	Resolv'd to carry her: let her in fine consent,
	As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
	Now, his important blood will nought deny
	That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,
	That down ward hath succeeded in his house
	From son to son, some four or five descents
	Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds
	In most rich choice; yet, in his idle fire,
	To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
	Howe'er repented after.

<WIDOW>	<61%>
	Now I see
	The bottom of your purpose.
</WIDOW>

<HELENA>	<61%>
	You see it lawful then. It is no more,
	But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
	Desires this ring, appoints him an encounter,
	In fine, delivers me to fill the time,
	Herself most chastely absent. After this,
	To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns
	To what is past already.
</HELENA>

<WIDOW>	<61%>
	I have yielded.
	Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,
	That time and place with this deceit so lawful
	May prove coherent. Every night he comes
	With musics of all sorts and songs compos'd
	To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us
	To chide him from our eaves, for he persists
	As if his life lay on't.
</WIDOW>

<HELENA>	<61%>
	Why then to-night
	Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,
	Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed,

	'Tis not the many oaths that make the truth,

	What is not holy, that we swear not by,
	But take the Highest to witness: then, pray you, tell me,
	If I should swear by God's great attributes
	I lov'd you dearly, would you believe my oaths,
	When I did love you ill? this has no holding,
	To swear by him whom I protest to love,
	That I will work against him: therefore your oaths
	Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd;
	At least in my opinion.

	My love as it begins shall so persever.

	You have not given him his mother's letter?
</LORD 1>

<LORD 2>	<68%>
	I have delivered it an hour since: there is something in't that stings his nature, for on the reading it he changed almost into another man.
</LORD 2>

<LORD 1>	<68%>
	He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.
</LORD 1>

<LORD 2>	<68%>
	Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.

<LORD 1>	<68%>
	When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the grave of it.
</LORD 1>

<LORD 2>	<68%>
	He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.
</LORD 2>

<LORD 1>	<68%>
	Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves, what things are we!
</LORD 1>

<LORD 2>	<69%>
	Merely our own traitors: and as in the common course of all treasons, we still see them reveal themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends, so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.
</LORD 2>

<LORD 1>	<69%>
	Is it not most damnable in us, to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his company to-night?
</LORD 1>

<LORD 2>	<69%>
	Not till after midnight, for he is dieted to his hour.
</LORD 2>

<LORD 1>	<69%>
	That approaches apace: I would gladly have him see his company anatomized, that he might take a measure of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.
</LORD 1>

<LORD 2>	<69%>
	We will not meddle with him till he come, for his presence must be the whip of the other.
</LORD 2>

<LORD 1>	<69%>
	In the meantime what near you of these wars?
</LORD 1>

<LORD 2>	<69%>
	I hear there is an overture of peace.
</LORD 2>

<LORD 1>	<69%>
	Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.

	What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel higher, or return again into France?
</LORD 2>

<LORD 1>	<69%>
	I perceive by this demand, you are not altogether of his council.
</LORD 1>

<LORD 2>	<69%>
	Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal of his act.
</LORD 2>

<LORD 1>	<69%>
	Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing, the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven.
</LORD 1>

<LORD 2>	<70%>
	How is this justified?
</LORD 2>

<LORD 1>	<70%>
	The stronger part of it by her own letters, which make her story true, even to the point of her death: her death itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by the rector of the place.
</LORD 1>

<LORD 2>	<70%>
	Hath the count all this intelligence?
</LORD 2>

<LORD 1>	<70%>
	Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from point, to the full arming of the verity.
</LORD 1>

<LORD 2>	<70%>
	I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.
</LORD 2>

<LORD 1>	<70%>
	How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!
</LORD 1>

<LORD 2>	<70%>
	And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample.
</LORD 2>

<LORD 1>	<70%>
	The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together: our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not; and our crimes would despair if they were not cherished by our virtues.

	They shall be no more than needful there, if they were more than they can commend.

</STAGE DIR>
	How now, my lord! is't not after midnight?
<BERTRAM>	<71%>
	I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success: I have conge'd with the duke, done my adieu with his nearest, buried a wife, mourned for her, writ to my lady mother I am returning, entertained my convoy; and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many nicer needs: the last was the greatest, but that I have not ended yet.
</BERTRAM>

<LORD 2>	<71%>
	If the business be of any difficulty, and this morning your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship.
</LORD 2>

<BERTRAM>	<71%>
	I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit model: he has deceived me, like a double-meaning prophesier.

	No matter; his heels have deserved it, in usurping his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?
</BERTRAM>

<LORD 1>	<71%>
	I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry him. But to answer you as you would be understood; he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he hath confessed himself to Morgan,—whom he supposes to be a friar,—from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i' the stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?
</LORD 1>

<BERTRAM>	<72%>
	Nothing of me, has a'?

<SOLDIER 1>	<72%>
	First, demand of him how many horse the duke is strong. What say you to that?
</SOLDIER 1>

<PAROLLES>	<72%>
	Five or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation and credit, and as I hope to live.
</PAROLLES>

<SOLDIER 1>	<73%>
	Shall I set down your answer so?
</SOLDIER 1>

<PAROLLES>	<73%>
	Do: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.
</PAROLLES>

<BERTRAM>	<73%>
	All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!
</BERTRAM>

<LORD 1>	<73%>
	You are deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur Parolles, the gallant militarist,—that was his own phrase,—that had the whole theorick of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the chape of his dagger.
</LORD 1>

<LORD 2>	<73%>
	I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean; nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly.
</LORD 2>

<SOLDIER 1>	<73%>
	Well, that's set down.
</SOLDIER 1>

<PAROLLES>	<73%>
	Five or six thousand horse, I said,—I will say true,—or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth.
</PAROLLES>

<LORD 1>	<73%>
	He's very near the truth in this.
</LORD 1>

<BERTRAM>	<73%>
	But I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he delivers it.
</BERTRAM>

<PAROLLES>	<73%>
	Poor rogues, I pray you, say.
</PAROLLES>

<SOLDIER 1>	<73%>
	Well, that's set down.
</SOLDIER 1>

<PAROLLES>	<73%>
	I humbly thank you, sir. A truth's a truth; the rogues are marvellous poor.
</PAROLLES>

<SOLDIER 1>	<73%>
	Demand of him, of what strength they are a-foot. What say you to that?
</SOLDIER 1>

<PAROLLES>	<73%>
	By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick, and Gratii, two hundred fifty each; mine own company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand poll; half of the which dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.
</PAROLLES>

<BERTRAM>	<74%>
	What shall be done to him?
</BERTRAM>

<LORD 1>	<74%>
	Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my condition, and what credit I have with the duke.
</LORD 1>

<SOLDIER 1>	<74%>
	Well, that's set down. You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain be i' the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is with the duke; what his valour, honesty, and expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to a revolt. What say you to this? what do you know of it?
</SOLDIER 1>

<PAROLLES>	<74%>
	I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the inter'gatories: demand them singly.
</PAROLLES>

<SOLDIER 1>	<74%>
	Do you know this Captain Dumain?
</SOLDIER 1>

<PAROLLES>	<74%>

	What is his reputation with the duke?
</SOLDIER 1>

<PAROLLES>	<75%>
	The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine, and writ to me this other day to turn him out o' the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.

<SOLDIER 1>	<75%>
	Marry, we'll search.
</SOLDIER 1>

	Dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold—
</SOLDIER 1>

<PAROLLES>	<75%>
	That is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it up again.
</PAROLLES>

<SOLDIER 1>	<75%>
	Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour.
</SOLDIER 1>

<PAROLLES>	<75%>
	My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity, and devours up all the fry it finds.
</PAROLLES>

<BERTRAM>	<75%>
	Damnable both-sides rogue!
</BERTRAM>

<SOLDIER 1>	<75%>
	When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;
	After he scores, he never pays the score:
	Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;
	He ne'er pays after-debts; take it before,
	And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this,
	Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss;
	For count of this, the count's a fool, I know it,
	Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.

<SOLDIER 1>	<76%>
	We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely: therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain. You have answered to his reputation with the duke and to his valour: what is his honesty?
</SOLDIER 1>

<PAROLLES>	<76%>
	He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister; for rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus; he professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he is stronger than Hercules; he will lie, sir, with such volubility, that you would think truth were a fool; drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine-drunk, and in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they know his conditions, and lay him in straw. I have but little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has everything that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should have, he has nothing.
</PAROLLES>

<LORD 1>	<77%>
	I begin to love him for this.
</LORD 1>

<SOLDIER 1>	<77%>
	What say you to his expertness in war?
</SOLDIER 1>

<PAROLLES>	<77%>
	Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English tragedians,—to belie him I will not,—and more of his soldiership I know not; except, in that country, he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of this I am not certain.
</PAROLLES>

<LORD 1>	<77%>
	He hath out-villained villany so far, that the rarity redeems him.
</LORD 1>

<BERTRAM>	<77%>
	A pox on him! he's a cat still.
</BERTRAM>

<SOLDIER 1>	<77%>
	His qualities being at this poor price, I need not ask you, if gold will corrupt him to revolt.
</SOLDIER 1>

<PAROLLES>	<77%>
	Sir, for a cardecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the entail from all remainders, and a perpetual succession for it perpetually.

<SOLDIER 1>	<77%>
	What's he?
</SOLDIER 1>

<PAROLLES>	<77%>
	E'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether so great as the first in goodness, but greater a great deal in evil. He excels his brother for a coward, yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is. In a retreat he out-runs any lackey; marry, in coming on he has the cramp.

	There is no remedy, sir, but you must die. The general says, you, that have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army, and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use; therefore you must die. Come, headsman, off with his head.

	Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir: I spake but by a metaphor.

<LAFEU>	<88%>
	This I must say,—

</KING>

<BERTRAM>	<89%>
	Admiringly, my liege:
	At first I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart
	Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue,
	Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
	Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
	Which warp'd the line of every other favour;
	Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;
	Extended or contracted all proportions
	To a most hideous object: thence it came
	That she, whom all men prais'd, and whom myself,
	Since I have lost, have lov'd, was in mine eye
	The dust that did offend it.
</BERTRAM>

<KING>	<90%>
	Well excus'd:
	That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away
	From the great compt. But love that comes too late,
	Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
	To the great sender turns a sour offence,
	Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rasher faults
	Make trivial price of serious things we have,
	Not knowing them until we know their grave:
	Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,
	Destroy our friends and after weep their dust:
	Our own love waking cries to see what's done,
	While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.
	Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.
	Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:
	The main consents are had; and here we'll stay
	To see our widower's second marriage-day.

	Necessitied to help, that by this token
	I would relieve her. Had you that craft to reave her
	Of what should stead her most?

<BERTRAM>	<91%>

</LAFEU>

<BERTRAM>	<91%>
	You are deceiv'd, my lord, she never saw it:
	In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
	Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name
	Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought
	I stood engag'd: but when I had subscrib'd
	To mine own fortune, and inform'd her fully
	I could not answer in that course of honour
	As she had made the overture, she ceas'd,
	In heavy satisfaction, and would never
	Receive the ring again.
</BERTRAM>

<KING>	<91%>
	Plutus himself,
	That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,
	Hath not in nature's mystery more science
	Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,
	Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know
	That you are well acquainted with yourself,
	Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
	You got it from her. She call'd the saints to surety,
	That she would never put it from her finger
	Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,
	Where you have never come, or sent it us
	Upon her great disaster.
</KING>

<BERTRAM>	<92%>
	She never saw it.
</BERTRAM>

<KING>	<92%>
	Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;
	And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me
	Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
	That thou art so inhuman,—'twill not prove so;—
	And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,
	And she is dead; which nothing, but to close
	Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,
	More than to see this ring. Take him away.
<STAGE DIR>
<Guards seize Bertram.>

</STAGE DIR>
<GENTLEMAN>	<92%>
	Gracious sovereign,
	Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:
	Here's a petition from a Florentine,
	Who hath, for four or five removes come short
	To tender it herself. I undertook it,
	Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
	Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know
	Is here attending: her business looks in her
	With an importing visage, and she told me,
	In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern
	Your highness with herself.
</GENTLEMAN>

<KING>	<93%>
	"Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow him to his country for justice. Grant it me, O king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor maid is undone. DIANA CAPILET."
</KING>

<LAFEU>	<93%>
	I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this: I'll none of him.

<Re-enter the gentle Astringer, with Widow and Diana.>

<DIANA>	<93%>
	I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,

</BERTRAM>

</DIANA>

<BERTRAM>	<94%>
	She's none of mine, my lord.
</BERTRAM>

<DIANA>	<94%>
	If you shall marry,
	You give away this hand, and that is mine;
	You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;
	You give away myself, which is known mine;

	That she which marries you must marry me;
	Either both or none.

	My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature,

	Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend,

	Good my lord,

	She's impudent, my lord;

<DIANA>	<95%>
	He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,
	He might have bought me at a common price:
	Do not believe him. O! behold this ring,

	Did lack a parallel; yet for all that
	He gave it to a commoner o' the camp,
	If I be one.

	Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,
	That will speak anything?
</BERTRAM>

<KING>	<95%>
	She hath that ring of yours.
</KING>

<BERTRAM>	<95%>
	I think she has: certain it is I lik'd her,
	And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth.
	She knew her distance and did angle for me,
	Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
	As all impediments in fancy's course
	Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,
	Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,
	Subdued me to her rate; she got the ring,
	And I had that which any inferior might
	At market-price have bought.
</BERTRAM>

<DIANA>	<96%>
	I must be patient;
	You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,
	May justly diet me. I pray you yet,—

	Send for your ring; I will return it home,
	And give me mine again.

	Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.

	Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,

	So please your majesty, my master hath been an honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have.

	How, I pray you?

	He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.
</PAROLLES>

	How is that?
</KING>

<PAROLLES>	<97%>
	He loved her, sir, and loved her not.

<KING>	<97%>
	But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?
</KING>

<PAROLLES>	<97%>
	Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them, as I said; but more than that, he loved her, for, indeed, he was mad for her, and talked of Satan, and of limbo, and of Furies, and I know not what: yet I was in that credit with them at that time, that I knew of their going to bed, and of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak of: therefore I will not speak what I know.
</PAROLLES>

<KING>	<97%>
	Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are married: but thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand aside. This ring, you say, was yours?
</KING>

<DIANA>	<97%>
	Ay, my good lord.
</DIANA>

<KING>	<97%>
	Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?

	Wherefore hast thou accus'd him all this while?
</KING>

	Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty.
	He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;
