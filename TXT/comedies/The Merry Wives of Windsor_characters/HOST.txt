<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	Hast thou no suit against my knight, my guest-cavalier?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
	My hand, bully: thou shalt have egress and regress; said I well? and thy name shall be Brook. It is a merry knight. Will you go, mynheers?

	To see thee fight, to see thee foin, to see thee traverse; to see thee here, to see thee there; to see thee pass thy punto, thy stock, thy reverse, thy distance, thy montant. Is he dead, my Ethiopian? is he dead, my Francisco? ha, bully! What says my Æsculapius? my Galen? my heart of elder? ha! is he dead, bully stale? is he dead?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
	Thou art a Castilian King Urinal! Hector of Greece, my boy!

	And moreover, bully,—But first, Master guest, and Master Page, and eke Cavaliero Slender, go you through the town to Frogmore.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
	He is there: see what humour he is in; and I will bring the doctor about by the fields. Will it do well?
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 3><42%>
	Let him die. Sheathe thy impatience; throw cold water on thy choler: go about the fields with me through Frogmore: I will bring thee where Mistress Anne Page is, at a farmhouse a-feasting; and thou shalt woo her. Cried I aim? said I well?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 3><42%>
	For the which I will be thy adversary toward Anne Page: said I well?

<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Peace, I say! hear mine host of the Garter. Am I politic? am I subtle? am I a Machiavel? Shall I lose my doctor? no; he gives me the potions and the motions. Shall I lose my parson, my priest, my Sir Hugh? no; he gives me the proverbs and the no-verbs. Give me thy hand, terrestrial; so;—give me thy hand celestial; so. Boys of art, I have deceived you both; I have directed you to wrong places: your hearts are mighty, your skins are whole, and let burnt sack be the issue. Come, lay their swords to pawn. Follow me, lads of peace; follow, follow, follow.
