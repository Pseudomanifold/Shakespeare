	It pleaseth you, my royal father, to express
	My commendations great, whose merit's less.

	Which, to preserve mine honour, I'll perform.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	A knight of Sparta, my renowned father;
	And the device he bears upon his shield
	Is a black Ethiop reaching at the sun;
	The word, Lux tua vita mihi.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	A prince of Macedon, my royal father;
	And the device he bears upon his shield
	Is an arm'd knight that's conquer'd by a lady;
	The motto thus, in Spanish, Piu por dulzura que por fuerza.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	The third of Antioch;
	And his device, a wreath of chivalry;
	The word, Me pompæ provexit apex.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	A burning torch that's turned upside down;
	The word, Quod me alit me extinguit.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	The fifth, a hand environed with clouds,
	Holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried;
	The motto thus, Sic spectanda fides.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
	He seems to be a stranger; but his present is
	A wither'd branch, that's only green at top;

	But you, my knight and guest;

	What is it

<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	Alas! my father, it befits not me
	Unto a stranger knight to be so bold;
	He may my proffer take for an offence,

	The king, my father, sir, has drunk to you.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	Wishing it so much blood unto your life.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	And further he desires to know of you,

<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	He thanks your Grace; names himself Pericles,
	A gentleman of Tyre,
	Who only by misfortune of the seas

	Why, sir, say if you had,

	Yes, if you love me, sir.

	O dear Diana!
	Where am I? Where's my lord? What world is this?
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 4><57%>
	It is my lord's.
	That I was shipp'd at sea, I well remember,
	Even on my eaning time; but whether there
	Deliver'd, by the holy gods,
	I cannot rightly say. But since King Pericles,
	My wedded lord, I ne'er shall see again,
	A vestal livery will I take me to,
	And never more have joy.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 4><57%>
	My recompense is thanks, that's all;
	Yet my good will is great, though the gift small.
	Imagine Pericles arriv'd at Tyre,
	Welcom'd and settled to his own desire.
	His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,
	Unto Diana there a votaress.
	Now to Marina bend your mind,
	Whom our fast-growing scene must find
	At Tarsus, and by Cleon train'd
	In music, letters; who hath gain'd
	Of education all the grace,
	Which makes her bath the heart and places
	Of general wonder. But, alack!
	That monster envy, oft the wrack
	Of earned praise, Marina's life
	Seeks to take off by treason's knife.
	And in this kind hath our Cleon
	One daughter, and a wench full grown,
	Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid
	Hight Philoten, and it is said
	For certain in our story, she
	Would ever with Marina be:
	Be 't when she weav'd the sleided silk
	With fingers, long, small, white as milk,
	Or when she would with sharp neeld wound
	The cambric, which she made more sound
	By hurting it; when to the lute
	She sung, and made the night-bird mute,
	That still records with moan; or when
	She would with rich and constant pen
	Vail to her mistress Dian; still
	This Philoten contends in skill
	With absolute Marina: so
	With the dove of Paphos might the crow
	Vie feathers white. Marina gets
	All praises, which are paid as debts,
	And not as given. This so darks
	In Philoten all graceful marks,
	That Cleon's wife, with envy rare,
	A present murderer does prepare
	For good Marina, that her daughter
	Might stand peerless by this slaughter.
	The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,
	Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:
	And cursed Dionyza hath
	The pregnant instrument of wrath
	Prest for this blow. The unborn event
	I do commend to your content:
	Only I carry winged time
	Post on the lame feet of my rime;
	Which never could I so convey,
	Unless your thoughts went on my way.
	Dionyza doth appear,
	With Leonine, a murderer.

	O! let me look!
	If he be none of mine, my sanctity
	Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,

	Are you not Pericles? Like him you speak,
	Like him you are. Did you not name a tempest,
	A birth, and death?
<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>

	And drown'd.

	Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,
	My father's dead.
