	I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	See, where she comes apparell'd like the spring,
	Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king
	Of every virtue gives renown to men!
	Her face the book of praises, where is read
	Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence
	Sorrow were ever raz'd, and testy wrath
	Could never be her mild companion.
	You gods, that made me man, and sway in love,
	That hath inflam'd desire in my breast
	To taste the fruit of you celestial tree
	Or die in the adventure, be my helps,
	As I am son and servant to your will,
	To compass such a boundless happiness!
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	That would be son to great Antiochus.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught
	My frail mortality to know itself,
	And by those fearful objects to prepare
	This body, like to them, to what I must;
	For death remember'd should be like a mirror,
	Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.
	I'll make my will then; and as sick men do,
	Who know the world, see heaven, but feeling woe,
	Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did:
	So I bequeath a happy peace to you
	And all good men, as every prince should do;
	My riches to the earth from whence they came,
	But my unspotted fire of love to you.
	Thus ready for the way of life or death,
	I wait the sharpest blow.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,
	Nor ask advice of any other thought
	But faithfulness and courage.
	I am no viper, yet I feed
	On mother's flesh which did me breed;
	I sought a husband, in which labour
	I found that kindness in a father.
	He's father, son, and husband mild,
	I mother, wife, and yet his child.
	How they may be, and yet in two,
	As you will live, resolve it you.
	Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers!
	That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,
	Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,
	If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?
	Fair glass of light, I lov'd you, and could still,
	Were not this glorious casket stor'd with ill:
	But I must tell you now my thoughts revolt;
	For he's no man on whom perfections wait
	That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.
	You're a fair viol, and your sense the strings,
	Who, finger'd to make men his lawful music,
	Would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken;
	But being play'd upon before your time,
	Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
	Good sooth, I care not for you.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Great king,
	Few love to hear the sins they love to act;
	'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.
	Who has a book of all that monarchs do,
	He's more secure to keep it shut than shown;
	For vice repeated is like the wandering wind,
	Blows dust in others' eyes, to spread itself;
	And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,
	The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear
	To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts
	Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd
	By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for 't.
	Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's their will;
	And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?
	It is enough you know; and it is fit,
	What being more known grows worse, to smother it.
	All love the womb that their first being bred,
	Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	How courtesy would seem to cover sin,
	When what is done is like a hypocrite,
	The which is good in nothing but in sight!
	If it be true that I interpret false,
	Then were it certain you were not so bad
	As with foul incest to abuse your soul;
	Where now you're both a father and a son,
	By your untimely claspings with your child,—
	Which pleasure fits a husband, not a father;—
	And she an eater of her mother's flesh,
	By the defiling of her parent's bed;
	And both like serpents are, who though they feed
	On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.
	Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men
	Blush not in actions blacker than the night,
	Will shun no course to keep them from the light.
	One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
	Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke.
	Poison and treason are the hands of sin,
	Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:
	Then, lest my life be cropp'd to keep you clear,
	By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	</STAGE DIR> Let none disturb us.—
	Why should this change of thoughts,
	The sad companion, dull-ey'd melancholy,
	Be my so us'd a guest, as not an hour
	In the day's glorious walk or peaceful night—
	The tomb where grief should sleep—can breed me quiet?
	Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,
	And danger, which I feared, is at Antioch,
	Whose arm seems far too short to hit me here;
	Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,
	Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.
	Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,
	That have their first conception by mis-dread,
	Have after-nourishment and life by care;
	And what was first but fear what might be done,
	Grows elder now and cares it be not done.
	And so with me: the great Antiochus,—
	'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,
	Since he's so great can make his will his act,—
	Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;
	Nor boots it me to say I honour him,
	If he suspect I may dishonour him;
	And what may make him blush in being known,
	He'll stop the course by which it might be known.
	With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,
	And with the ostent of war will look so huge,
	Amazement shall drive courage from the state,
	Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,
	And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:
	Which care of them, not pity of myself,—
	Who am no more but as the tops of trees,
	Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,—
	Make both my body pine and soul to languish,
	And punish that before that he would punish.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	All leave us else; but let your cares o'erlook
	What shipping and what lading's in our haven,
	And then return to us.

	Hast mov'd us; what seest thou in our looks?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>

	Who by thy wisdom mak'st a prince thy servant,
	What wouldst thou have me do?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,
	That minister'st a potion unto me
	That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
	Attend me then: I went to Antioch,
	Where as thou know'st, against the face of death
	I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty,
	From whence an issue I might propagate
	Are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects.
	Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;
	The rest, hark in thine ear, as black as incest;
	Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father
	Seem'd not to strike, but smooth; but thou know'st this,
	'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.
	Which fear so grew in me I hither fled,
	Under the covering of a careful night,
	Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,
	Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.
	I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears
	Decrease not, but grow faster than the years.
	And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,
	That I should open to the listening air
	How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,
	To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,
	To lop that doubt he'll fill this land with arms,
	And make pretence of wrong that I have done him;
	When all, for mine, if I may call 't, offence,
	Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:
	Which love to all, of which thyself art one,
	Who now reprov'st me for it,—
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
	Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,
	Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts
	How I might stop this tempest, ere it came;

	I thought it princely charity to grieve them.

	On thee I'll lay, whose wisdom's strength can bear it.
	I'll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath;
	Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both.
	But in our orbs we'll live so round and safe,
	That time of both this truth shall ne'er convince,
	Thou show'dst a subject's shine, I a true prince.

	Lord governor, for so we hear you are,
	Let not our ships and number of our men,

	We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,
	And seen the desolation of your streets:
	Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
	But to relieve them of their heavy load;
	And these our ships, you happily may think
	Are like the Trojan horse was stuff'd within
	With bloody veins, expecting overthrow,
	Are stor'd with corn to make your needy bread,
	And give them life whom hunger starv'd half dead.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 4><20%>
	Arise, I pray you, rise:
	We do not look for reverence, but for love,
	And harbourage for ourself, our ships, and men.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 4><21%>
	Which welcome we'll accept; feast here awhile,
	Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.
	Here have you seen a mighty king
	His child, I wis, to incest bring;
	A better prince and benign lord,
	That will prove awful both in deed and word.
	Be quiet, then, as men should be,
	Till he hath pass'd necessity.
	I'll show you those in troubles reign,
	Losing a mite, a mountain gain.
	The good in conversation,
	To whom I give my benison,
	Is still at Tarsus, where each man
	Thinks all is writ he speken can;
	And, to remember what he does,
	Build his statue to make him glorious:
	But tidings to the contrary
	Are brought your eyes; what need speak I?
	Good Helicane hath stay'd at home,
	Not to eat honey like a drone
	From others' labours; for though he strive
	To killen bad, keep good alive,
	And to fulfil his prince' desire,
	Sends word of all that haps in Tyre:
	How Thaliard came full bent with sin
	And had intent to murder him;
	And that in Tarsus was not best
	Longer for him to make his rest.
	He, doing so, put forth to seas,
	Where when men been, there's seldom ease;
	For now the wind begins to blow;
	Thunder above and deeps below
	Make such unquiet, that the ship
	Should house him safe is wrack'd and split;
	And he, good prince, having all lost,
	By waves from coast to coast is tost.
	All perishen of man, of pelf,
	Ne aught escapen but himself;
	Till Fortune, tir'd with doing bad,
	Threw him ashore, to give him glad;
	And here he comes. What shall be next,
	Pardon old Gower, this longs the text.

	Yet cease your ire, you angry stars of heaven!

	Wash'd me from shore to shore, and left me breath
	Nothing to think on but ensuing death:

	As doth the sea she lies in, yet the end
	Must be as 'tis. My gentle babe Marina—whom,
	For she was born at sea, I have nam'd so—here
	I charge your charity withal, and leave her
	The infant of your care, beseeching you
	To give her princely training, that she may be
	Manner'd as she is born.
<SPEECH 78><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
	I believe you;
	Your honour and your goodness teach me to 't,
	Without your vows. Till she be married, madam,
	By bright Diana, whom we honour, all
	Unscissar'd shall this hair of mine remain,
	Though I show ill in 't. So I take my leave.
	Good madam, make me blessed in your care
	In bringing up my child.
<SPEECH 79><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
	Madam, my thanks and prayers.
<SPEECH 80><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
	I will embrace
	Your offer. Come, dearest madam. O! no tears,
	Lychorida, no tears:
	Look to your little mistress, on whose grace
	You may depend hereafter. Come, my lord.
<SPEECH 81><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Hum! ha!
<SPEECH 82><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	My fortunes—parentage—good parentage—
	To equal mine!—was it not thus? what say you?
<SPEECH 83><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me.
	You are like something that—What country-woman?
	Here of these shores?
<SPEECH 84><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.
	My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one
	My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;
	Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;
	As silver-voic'd; her eyes as jewel-like,
	And cas'd as richly; in pace another Juno;
	Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,
	The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?
<SPEECH 85><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	Where were you bred?
	And how achiev'd you these endowments, which
	You make more rich to owe?
<SPEECH 86><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	Prithee, speak;
	Falseness cannot come from thee, for thou look'st
	Modest as justice, and thou seem'st a palace
	For the crown'd truth to dwell in. I believe thee,
	And make my senses credit thy relation
	To points that seem impossible; for thou lookest
	Like one I lov'd indeed. What were thy friends?
	Didst thou not say when I did push thee back,—
	Which was when I perceiv'd thee,—that thou cam'st
	From good descending?
<SPEECH 87><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	Report thy parentage. I think thou saidst
	Thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury,
	And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,
	If both were open'd.
<SPEECH 88><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	Tell thy story;
	If thine consider'd prove the thousandth part
	Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I
	Have suffer'd like a girl; yet thou dost look
	Like Patience gazing on kings' graves, and smiling
	Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?
	How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?
	Recount, I do beseech thee. Come, sit by me.
<SPEECH 89><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	O! I am mock'd,
	And thou by some incensed god sent hither
	To make the world to laugh at me.
<SPEECH 90><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	Nay, I'll be patient.
	Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me,
	To call thyself Marina.
<SPEECH 91><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	How! a king's daughter?
	And call'd Marina?
<SPEECH 92><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	But are you flesh and blood?
	Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?
	Motion!—Well; speak on. Where were you born?
	And wherefore call'd Marina?
<SPEECH 93><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	At sea! what mother?
<SPEECH 94><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	O! stop there a little.
	This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep
	Did mock sad fools withal; this cannot be.
	My daughter's buried. Well; where were you bred?
	I'll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,
	And never interrupt you.
<SPEECH 95><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	I will believe you by the syllable
	Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave:
	How came you in these parts? where were you bred?
<SPEECH 96><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	Ho, Helicanus!
<SPEECH 97><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	Thou art a grave and noble counsellor,
	Most wise in general; tell me, if thou canst,
	What this maid is, or what is like to be,
	That thus hath made me weep?
<SPEECH 98><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	O Helicanus! strike me, honour'd sir;
	Give me a gash, put me to present pain,
	Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me
	O'erbear the shores of my mortality,
	And drown me with their sweetness. O! come hither,
	Thou that begett'st him that did thee beget;
	Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,
	And found at sea again. O Helicanus!
	Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud
	As thunder threatens us; this is Marina.
	What was thy mother's name? tell me but that,
	For truth can never be confirm'd enough,
	Though doubts did ever sleep.
<SPEECH 99><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now
	My drown'd queen's name, as in the rest you said
	Thou hast been god-like perfect;
	Thou'rt heir of kingdoms, and another life
	To Pericles thy father.
<SPEECH 100><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child,
	Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus;
	She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,
	By savage Cleon; she shall tell thee all;
	When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge
	She is thy very princess. Who is this?
<SPEECH 101><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	I embrace you.
	Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.
	O heavens! bless my girl. But, hark! what music?
	Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him
	O'er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,
	How sure you are my daughter. But, what music?
<SPEECH 102><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	None!
	The music of the spheres! List, my Marina.
<SPEECH 103><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	Rarest sounds! Do ye not hear?
<SPEECH 104><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	Most heavenly music:
	It nips me unto list'ning, and thick slumber
	Hangs upon mine eyes; let me rest.
<SPEECH 105><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
	Celestial Dian, goddess argentine,
	I will obey thee! Helicanus!
<SPEECH 106><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
	My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike
	The inhospitable Cleon: but I am
	For other service first: toward Ephesus
	Turn our blown sails; eftsoons I'll tell thee why.
	</STAGE DIR> Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore,
	And give you gold for such provision
	As our intents will need?
<SPEECH 107><ACT 5><SCENE 1><95%>
	You shall prevail,
	Were it to woo my daughter; for it seems
	You have been noble towards her.
<SPEECH 108><ACT 5><SCENE 1><95%>
	Come, my Marina.
	Now our sands are almost run;
	More a little, and then dumb.
	This, my last boon, give me,
	For such kindness must relieve me,
	That you aptly will suppose
	What pageantry, what feats, what shows,
	What minstrelsy, and pretty din,
	The regent made in Mitylen
	To greet the king. So he thriv'd,
	That he is promis'd to be wiv'd
	To fair Marina; but in no wise
	Till he had done his sacrifice,
	As Dian bade: whereto being bound,
	The interim, pray you, all confound.
	In feather'd briefness sails are fill'd,
	And wishes fall out as they're will'd.
	At Ephesus, the temple see,
	Our king and all his company.
	That he can hither come so soon,
	Is by your fancy's thankful doom.
<SPEECH 109><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
	Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,
	I here confess myself the King of Tyre;
	Who, frighted from my country, did wed
	At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.
	At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth
	A maid-child call'd Marina; who, O goddess!
	Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus
	Was nurs'd with Cleon, whom at fourteen years
	He sought to murder; but her better stars
	Brought her to Mitylene, 'gainst whose shore
	Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,
	Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she
	Made known herself my daughter.
<SPEECH 110><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
	What means the nun? she dies! help, gentlemen!
<SPEECH 111><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
	Reverend appearer, no;
	I threw her o'erboard with these very arms.
<SPEECH 112><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	'Tis most certain.
<SPEECH 113><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	May we see them?
<SPEECH 114><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	The voice of dead Thaisa!
<SPEECH 115><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	Immortal Dian!
<SPEECH 116><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
	This, this: no more, you gods! your present kindness
	Makes my past miseries sport: you shall do well,
	That on the touching of her lips I may
	Melt and no more be seen. O! come, be buried
	A second time within these arms.
<SPEECH 117><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
	Look, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa;
	Thy burden at the sea, and call'd Marina,
	For she was yielded there.
<SPEECH 118><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
	You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre,
	I left behind an ancient substitute;
	Can you remember what I call'd the man?
	I have nam'd him oft.
<SPEECH 119><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
	Still confirmation!
	Embrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he.
	Now do I long to hear how you were found,
	How possibly preserv'd, and whom to thank,
	Besides the gods, for this great miracle.
<SPEECH 120><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
	Reverend sir,
	The gods can have no mortal officer
	More like a god than you. Will you deliver
	How this dead queen re-lives?
<SPEECH 121><ACT 5><SCENE 3><99%>
	Pure Dian! bless thee for thy vision; I
	Will offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa,
	This prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter,
	Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now
	This ornament
	Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;
	And what this fourteen years no rasor touch'd,
	To grace thy marriage-day I'll beautify.
<SPEECH 122><ACT 5><SCENE 3><99%>
	Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,
	We'll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves
	Will in that kingdom spend our following days;
	Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.
	Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay
	To hear the rest untold. Sir, lead's the way.
	In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard
	Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:
	In Pericles, his queen, and daughter, seen—
	Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen—
	Virtue preserv'd from fell destruction's blast,
	Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last.
	In Helicanus may you well descry
	A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty.
	In reverend Cerimon there well appears
	The worth that learned charity aye wears.
	For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame
	Had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name
	Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,
	That him and his they in his palace burn:
	The gods for murder seemed so content
	To punish them; although not done, but meant.
	So on your patience evermore attending,
	New joy wait on you! Here our play hath ending.
