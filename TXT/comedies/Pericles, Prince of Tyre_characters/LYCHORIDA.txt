	Here is a thing too young for such a place,
	Who, if it had conceit, would die, as I
	Am like to do: take in your arms this piece
	Of your dead queen.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Patience, good sir; do not assist the storm.
	Here's all that is left living of your queen,
	A little daughter: for the sake of it,
	Be manly, and take comfort.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Patience, good sir,
	Even for this charge.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	Here she lies, sir.
