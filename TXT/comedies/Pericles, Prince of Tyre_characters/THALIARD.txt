	Doth your highness call?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	My lord, 'tis done.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	My lord,
	If I can get him within my pistol's length,
	I'll make him sure enough: so, farewell to your highness.

	So this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must I kill King Pericles; and if I do not, I am sure to be hanged at home: 'tis dangerous. Well, I perceive he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that, being bid to ask what he would of the king, desired he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he had some reason for it; for if a king bid a man be a villain, he is bound by the indenture of his oath to be one. Hush! here come the lords of Tyre.

	</STAGE DIR> How! the king gone!
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	</STAGE DIR> What from Antioch?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	</STAGE DIR> Well, I perceive
	I shall not be hang'd now, although I would;
	But since he's gone, the king it sure must please:
	He 'scap'd the land, to perish at the sea.
	I'll present myself. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Peace to the lords of Tyre.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	From him I come,
	With message unto princely Pericles;
	But since my landing I have understood
	Your lord hath betook himself to unknown travels,
	My message must return from whence it came.
