	Are the knights ready to begin the triumph?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	Return them, we are ready; and our daughter,
	In honour of whose birth these triumphs are,
	Sits here, like beauty's child, whom nature gat
	For men to see, and seeing wonder at.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	'Tis fit it should be so; for princes are
	A model, which heaven makes like to itself:
	As jewels lose their glory if neglected,
	So princes their renowns if not respected.
	'Tis now your honour, daughter, to explain
	The labour of each knight in his device.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	Who is the first that doth prefer himself?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	He loves you well that holds his life of you.
	Who is the second that presents himself?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	And what's the third?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	What is the fourth?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	Which shows that beauty hath his power and will,
	Which can as well inflame as it can kill.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	And what 's
	The sixth and last, the which the knight himself
	With such a graceful courtesy deliver'd?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
	A pretty moral;
	From the dejected state wherein he is,
	He hopes by you his fortune yet may flourish.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
	Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan
	The outward habit by the inward man.
	But stay, the knights are coming; we'll withdraw
	Into the gallery.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
	Knights,
	To say you're welcome were superfluous.
	To place upon the volume of your deeds,
	As in a title-page, your worth in arms,
	Were more than you expect, or more than's fit,
	Since every worth in show commends itself.
	Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast:
	You are princes and my guests.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
	Call it by what you will, the day is yours;
	And here, I hope, is none that envies it.
	In framing an artist art hath thus decreed,
	To make some good, but others to exceed;
	And you're her labour'd scholar. Come, queen o' the feast,—
	For, daughter, so you are,—here take your place;
	Marshal the rest, as they deserve their grace.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
	Your presence glads our days; honour we love,
	For who hates honour, hates the gods above.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
	Sit, sir; sit.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
	He's but a country gentleman;
	He has done no more than other knights have done;
	He has broken a staff or so; so let it pass.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
	What, are you merry, knights?
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	Here, with a cup that's stor'd unto the brim,
	As you do love, fill to your mistress' lips,
	We drink this health to you.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	Yet pause awhile;
	Yon knight doth sit too melancholy,
	As if the entertainment in our court
	Had not a show might countervail his worth.
	Note it not you, Thaisa?
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	O! attend, my daughter:
	Princes in this should live like gods above,
	Who freely give to every one that comes
	To honour them;
	And princes not doing so are like to gnats,
	Which make a sound, but kill'd are wonder'd at.
	Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,
	Here say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	How!
	Do as I bid you, or you'll move me else.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	And further tell him, we desire to know of him,
	Of whence he is, his name, and parentage.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune,
	And will awake him from his melancholy.
	Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,
	And waste the time which looks for other revels.
	Even in your armours, as you are address'd,
	Will very well become a soldier's dance.
	I will not have excuse, with saying this
	Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads
	Since they love men in arms as well as beds.
	So this was well ask'd, 'twas so well perform'd.
	Come, sir;
	Here is a lady that wants breathing too:
	And I have often heard, you knights of Tyre
	Are excellent in making ladies trip,
	And that their measures are as excellent.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	O! that's as much as you would be denied
	Of your fair courtesy.
	Unclasp, unclasp;
	Thanks, gentlemen, to all; all have done well,
	</STAGE DIR> But you the best. Pages and lights, to conduct
	These knights unto their several lodgings! Yours, sir,
	We have given order to be next our own.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	Princes, it is too late to talk of love,
	And that's the mark I know you level at;
	Therefore each one betake him to his rest;
	To-morrow all for speeding do their best.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 5><40%>
	Knights, from my daughter this I let you know,
	That for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake
	A married life.
	Her reason to herself is only known,
	Which yet from her by no means can I get.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 5><40%>
	Faith, by no means; she hath so strictly tied
	Her to her chamber that 'tis impossible.
	One twelve moons more she'll wear Diana's livery;
	This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vow'd,
	And on her virgin honour will not break it.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 5><41%>
	So,
	They're well dispatch'd; now to my daughter's letter.
	She tells me here, she'll wed the stranger knight,
	Or never more to view nor day nor light.
	'Tis well, mistress; your choice agrees with mine;
	I like that well: how absolute she's in 't,
	Not minding whether I dislike or no!
	Well, I do commend her choice;
	And will no longer have it be delay'd.
	Soft! here he comes: I must dissemble it.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 5><41%>
	To you as much, sir! I am beholding to you
	For your sweet music this last night: I do
	Protest my ears were never better fed
	With such delightful pleasing harmony
<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 5><41%>
	Sir, you are music's master.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 5><41%>
	Let me ask you one thing.
	What do you think of my daughter, sir?
<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 5><41%>
	And she is fair too, is she not?
<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 5><42%>
	My daughter, sir, thinks very well of you;
	Ay, so well, that you must be her master,
	And she will be your scholar: therefore look to it.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 5><42%>
	She thinks not so; peruse this writing else.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 5><42%>
	Thou hast bewitch'd my daughter, and thou art
	A villain.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 5><42%>
	Traitor, thou liest.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 5><42%>
	Ay, traitor.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 5><42%>
	</STAGE DIR> Now, by the gods, I do applaud his courage.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 5><43%>
	No?
	Here comes my daughter, she can witness it.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 2><SCENE 5><43%>
	Yea, mistress, are you so peremptory?
	</STAGE DIR> I am glad on 't, with all my heart.
	I'll tame you; I'll bring you in subjection.
	Will you, not having my consent,
	Bestow your love and your affections
	Upon a stranger? <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> who, for aught I know,
	May be, nor can I think the contrary,
	As great in blood as I myself.—
	</STAGE DIR> Therefore, hear you, mistress; either frame
	Your will to mine; and you, sir, hear you,
	Either be rul'd by me, or I will make you—
	Man and wife: 
	Nay, come, your hands and lips must seal it too;
	And being join'd, I'll thus your hopes destroy;
	And for a further grief,—God give you joy!
	What! are you both pleas'd?
<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 5><44%>
	What! are you both agreed?
<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 5><44%>
	It pleaseth me so well, that I will see you wed;
	Then with what haste you can get you to bed.
	Now sleep yslaked hath the rout;
	No din but snores the house about,
	Made louder by the o'er-fed breast
	Of this most pompous marriage-feast.
	The cat, with eyne of burning coal,
	Now couches fore the mouse's hole;
	And crickets sing at the oven's mouth,
	E'er the blither for their drouth.
	Hymen hath brought the bride to bed,
	Where, by the loss of maidenhead,
	A babe is moulded. Be attent;
	And time that is so briefly spent
	With your fine fancies quaintly eche;
	What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech.
	By many a dern and painful perch,
	Of Pericles the careful search
	By the four opposing coigns,
	Which the world together joins,
	Is made with all due diligence
	That horse and sail and high expense,
	Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,—
	Fame answering the most strange inquire—
	To the court of King Simonides
	Are letters brought, the tenour these:
	Antiochus and his daughter dead;
	The men of Tyrus on the head
	Of Helicanus would set on
	The crown of Tyre, but he will none:
	The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress;
	Says to 'em, if King Pericles
	Come not home in twice six moons,
	He, obedient to their dooms,
	Will take the crown. The sum of this,
	Brought hither to Pentapolis,
	Yravished the regions round,
	And every one with claps can sound,
	'Our heir-apparent is a king!
	Who dream'd, who thought of such a thing?'
	Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:
	His queen, with child, makes her desire,—
	Which who shall cross?—along to go;
	Omit we all their dole and woe:
	Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,
	And so to sea. Their vessel shakes
	On Neptune's billow; half the flood
	Hath their keel cut: but Fortune's mood
	Varies again; the grisled north
	Disgorges such a tempest forth,
	That, as a duck for life that dives,
	So up and down the poor ship drives.
	The lady shrieks, and well-a-near
	Does fall in travail with her fear;
	And what ensues in this fell storm
	Shall for itself itself perform.
	I nill relate, action may
	Conveniently the rest convey,
	Which might not what by me is told.
	In your imagination hold
	This stage the ship, upon whose deck
	The sea-tost Pericles appears to speak.
