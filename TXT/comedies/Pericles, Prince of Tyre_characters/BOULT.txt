	Sir?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
	Ay, to eleven; and brought them down again. But shall I search the market?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
	Ay, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat for worms. But I'll go search the market.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	Come your ways. My masters, you say she's a virgin?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	Master, I have gone through for this piece, you see: if you like her, so; if not, I have lost my earnest.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	She has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent good clothes; there's no further necessity of qualities can make her be refused.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Performance shall follow.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs; I have drawn her picture with my voice.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	Faith, they listened to me, as they would have hearkened to their father's testament. There was a Spaniard's mouth so watered, that he went to bed to her very description.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	To-night, to-night. But, mistress, do you know the French knight that cowers i' the hams?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Ay; he offered to cut a caper at the proclamation; but he made a groan at it, and swore he would see her to-morrow.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Well, if we had of every nation a traveller, we should lodge them with this sign.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	O! take her home, mistress, take her home; these blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practice.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
	Faith, some do, and some do not. But, mistress, if I have bargained for the joint,—
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
	I may so?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
	Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
	I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up the lewdly-inclined. I'll bring home some to-night.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 6><75%>
	Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish us of all our cavaliers, and make all our swearers priests.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 6><75%>
	We should have both lord and lown if the peevish baggage would but give way to customers.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 6><75%>
	I am glad to see your honour in good health.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 6><76%>
	For flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall see a rose; and she were a rose indeed if she had but—
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 6><76%>
	O! sir, I can be modest.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 6><79%>
	I beseech your honour, one piece for me.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 6><79%>
	How's this? We must take another course with you. If your peevish chastity, which is not worth a breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope, shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded like a spaniel. Come your ways.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
	I must have your maidenhead taken off, or the common hangman shall execute it. Come your ways. We'll have no more gentlemen driven away. Come your ways, I say.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
	Worse and worse, mistress; she has here spoken holy words to the Lord Lysimachus.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
	She makes our profession as it were to stink afore the face of the gods.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
	The nobleman would have dealt with her like a nobleman, and she sent him away as cold as a snowball; saying his prayers too.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
	An if she were a thornier piece of ground than she is, she shall be ploughed.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 6><81%>
	Come, mistress; come your ways with me.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 6><81%>
	To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 6><81%>
	Come now, your one thing.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 6><81%>
	Why, I could wish him to be my master, or rather, my mistress.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 6><81%>
	What would you have me do? go to the wars, would you? where a man may serve seven years for the loss of a leg, and have not money enough in the end to buy him a wooden one?
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 6><82%>
	But can you teach all this you speak of?
<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 6><82%>
	Well, I will see what I can do for thee; if I can place thee, I will.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 6><82%>
	Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them. But since my master and mistress have bought you, there's no going but by their consent; therefore I will make them acquainted with your purpose, and I doubt not but I shall find them tractable enough. Come; I'll do for thee what I can; come your ways.
	Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chances
	Into an honest house, our story says.
	She sings like one immortal, and she dances
	As goddess-like to her admired lays;
	Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her neeld composes
	Nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,
	That even her art sisters the natural roses;
	Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry;
	That pupils lacks she none of noble race,
	Who pour their bounty on her; and her gain
	She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place;
	And to her father turn our thoughts again,
	Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost,
	Whence, driven before the winds, he is arriv'd
	Here where his daughter dwells: and on this coast
	Suppose him now at anchor. The city striv'd
	God Neptune's annual feast to keep; from whence
	Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,
	His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;
	And to him in his barge with fervour hies.
	In your supposing once more put your sight
	Of heavy Pericles; think this his bark:
	Where what is done in action, more, if might,
	Shall be discover'd; please you, sit and hark.
