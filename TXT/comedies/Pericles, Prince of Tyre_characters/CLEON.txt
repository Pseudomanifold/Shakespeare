	My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,
	And by relating tales of others' griefs,
	See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 4><17%>
	O Dionyza,
	Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,
	Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?
	Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
	Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep
	Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;
	That if heaven slumber while their creatures want,
	They may awake their helps to comfort them.
	I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,
	And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 4><17%>
	This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,
	A city on whom plenty held full hand,
	For riches strew'd herself even in the streets;
	Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,
	And strangers ne'er beheld but wonder'd at;
	Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,
	Like one another's glass to trim them by:
	Their tables were stor'd full to glad the sight,
	And not so much to feed on as delight;
	All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,
	The name of help grew odious to repeat.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 4><18%>
	But see what heaven can do! By this our change,
	These mouths, whom but of late earth, sea, and air
	Were all too little to content and please,
	Although they gave their creatures in abundance,
	As houses are defil'd for want of use,
	They are now starv'd for want of exercise;
	Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,
	Must have inventions to delight the taste,
	Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it;
	Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,
	Thought nought too curious, are ready now
	To eat those little darlings whom they lov'd.
	So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife
	Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life.
	Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;
	Here many sink, yet those which see them fall
	Have scarce strength left to give them burial.
	Is not this true?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 4><18%>
	O! let those cities that of plenty's cup
	And her prosperities so largely taste,
	With their superfluous riots, hear these tears:
	The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 4><19%>
	Here.
	Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,
	For comfort is too far for us to expect.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 4><19%>
	I thought as much.
	One sorrow never comes but brings an heir
	That may succeed as his inberitor;
	And so in ours. Some neighbouring nation,
	Taking advantage of our misery,
	Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,
	To beat us down, the which are down already;
	And make a conquest of unhappy me,
	Whereas no glory's got to overcome.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 4><19%>
	Thou speak'st like him 's untutor'd to repeat:
	Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.
	But bring they what they will and what they can,
	What need we fear?
	The ground's the lowest and we are half way there.
	Go tell their general we attend him here,
	To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,
	And what he craves.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 4><20%>
	Welcome is peace if he on peace consist;
	If wars we are unable to resist.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 4><20%>
	The which when any shall not gratify,
	Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,
	Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,
	The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!
	Till when—the which, I hope, shall ne'er be seen—
	Your Grace is welcome to our town and us.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
	Your shafts of fortune, though they hurt you mortally,
	Yet glance full wanderingly on us.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
	Fear not, my lord, but think
	Your Grace, that fed my country with your corn—
	For which the people's prayers still fall upon you—
	Must in your child be thought on. If neglection
	Should therein make me vile, the common body,
	By you reliev'd, would force me to my duty;
	But if to that my nature need a spur,
	The gods revenge it upon me and mine,
	To the end of generation!
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
	We'll bring your Grace e'en to the edge o' the shore;
	Then give you up to the mask'd Neptune and
	The gentlest winds of heaven.

	O Dionyza! such a piece of slaughter
	The sun and moon ne'er look'd upon.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,
	I'd give it to undo the deed. O lady!
	Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess
	To equal any single crown o' the earth
	I' the justice of compare. O villain Leonine!
	Whom thou hast poison'd too;
	If thou hadst drunk to him 't had been a kindness
	Becoming well thy fact; what canst thou say
	When noble Pericles shall demand his child?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	O! go to. Well, well,
	Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods
	Do like this worst.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	To such proceeding
	Who ever but his approbation added,
	Though not his prime consent, he did not flow
	From honourable sources.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
	Heavens forgive it!
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
	Thou art like the harpy,
	Which, to betray, dost with thine angel's face,
