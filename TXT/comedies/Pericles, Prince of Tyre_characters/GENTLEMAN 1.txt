	Good morrow, sir.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	Sir,
	Our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea,
	Shook as the earth' did quake;
	The very principals did seem to rend,
	And all to topple. Pure surprise and fear
	Made me to quit the house.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	But I much marvel that your lordship, having
	Rich tire about you, should at these early hours
	Shake off the golden slumber of repose.
	'Tis most strange,
	Nature should be so conversant with pain,
	Being thereto not compell'd.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	Most strange!
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	The heavens
	Through you increase our wonder and set up
	Your fame for ever.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	Most rare.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
	Did you ever hear the like?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
	But to have divinity preached there! did you ever dream of such a thing?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
	I'll do any thing now that is virtuous; but I am out of the road of rutting for ever.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	Doth your lordship call?
