	Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
	And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
	Within this hour it will be dinner-time:
	Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
	Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
	And then return and sleep within mine inn,
	For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
	Get thee away.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
	When I am dull with care and melancholy,
	Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
	What, will you walk with me about the town,
	And then go to my inn and dine with me?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	Farewell till then: I will go lose myself,
	And wander up and down to view the city.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	He that commends me to mine own content,
	Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
	I to the world am like a drop of water
	That in the ocean seeks another drop;
	Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
	Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
	So I, to find a mother and a brother,
	In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
	Here comes the almanack of my true date.
	What now? How chance thou art return'd so soon?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:
	Where have you left the money that I gave you?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	I am not in a sportive humour now.
	Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
	We being strangers here, how dar'st thou trust
	So great a charge from thine own custody?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	Come, Dromio, come; these jests are out of season;
	Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
	Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
	And tell me how thou hast dispos'd thy charge.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	Now, as I am a Christian, answer me,
	In what safe place you have bestow'd my money;
	Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
	That stands on tricks when I am undispos'd.
	Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
	Thy mistress' marks! what mistress, slave, hast thou?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
	What! wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
	Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 2><14%>
	Upon my life, by some device or other
	The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.
	They say this town is full of cozenage;
	As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
	Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
	Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
	Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
	And many such-like liberties of sin:
	If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
	I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
	I greatly fear my money is not safe.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 2><21%>
	The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
	Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave
	Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out.
	By computation, and mine host's report,
	I could not speak with Dromio since at first
	I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.
	How now, sir! is your merry humour alter'd?
	As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
	You know no Centaur? You receiv'd no gold?
	Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
	My house was at the Phœnix? Wast thou mad,
	That thus so madly thou didst answer me?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 2><21%>
	Even now, even here, not half-an-hour since.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 2><22%>
	Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
	And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
	For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeas'd.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 2><22%>
	Yea, dost thou jeer, and flout me in the teeth?
	Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 2><22%>
	Because that I familiarly sometimes
	Do use you for my fool, and chat with you,
	Your sauciness will jest upon my love,
	And make a common of my serious hours.
	When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
	But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
	If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
	And fashion your demeanour to my looks,
	Or I will beat this method in your sconce.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 2><23%>
	Dost thou not know?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 2><23%>
	Shall I tell you why?
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 2><23%>
	Why, first,—for flouting me; and then, wherefore,—
	For urging it the second time to me.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 2><23%>
	Thank me, sir! for what?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
	I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
	In good time, sir; what's that?
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
	Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
	Your reason?
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
	Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a time for all things.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
	By what rule, sir?
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
	Let's hear it.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
	May he not do it by fine and recovery?
<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
	Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?
<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
	Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
	Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
	For what reason?
<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
	Nay, not sound, I pray you.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
	Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	Name them.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	But your reason was not substantial, why there is not time to recover.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion.
	But soft! who wafts us yonder?
<SPEECH 40><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
	In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
	As strange unto your town as to your talk;
	Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,
	Want wit in all one word to understand.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	By Dromio?
<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	Did you converse, sir, with this gentle-woman?
	What is the course and drift of your compact?
<SPEECH 43><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
	Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	How can she thus then, call us by our names,
	Unless it be by inspiration?
<SPEECH 45><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme!
	What! was I married to her in my dream?
	Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?
	What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
	Until I know this sure uncertainty,
	I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	I think thou art, in mind, and so am I.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	Thou hast thine own form.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	</STAGE DIR> Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
	Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advis'd?
	Known unto these, and to myself disguis'd!
	I'll say as they say, and persever so,
	And in this mist at all adventures go.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 3><SCENE 2><42%>
	Sweet mistress,—what your name is else, I know not,
	Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,—
	Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
	Than our earth's wonder; more than earth divine.
	Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak:
	Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
	Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
	The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
	Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
	To make it wander in an unknown field?
	Are you a god? would you create me new?
	Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.
	But if that I am I, then well I know
	Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
	Nor to her bed no homage do I owe:
	Far more, far more, to you do I decline.
	O! train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
	To drown me in thy sister flood of tears:
	Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote:
	Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
	And as a bed I'll take them and there lie;
	And, in that glorious supposition think
	He gains by death that hath such means to die:
	Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
<SPEECH 50><ACT 3><SCENE 2><44%>
	Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 3><SCENE 2><44%>
	For gazing on your beams; fair sun, being by.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 3><SCENE 2><44%>
	As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 3><SCENE 2><44%>
	Thy sister's sister.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 3><SCENE 2><44%>
	No;
	It is thyself, mine own self's better part;
	Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart;
	My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope's aim,
	My sole earth's heaven, and my heaven's claim.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 3><SCENE 2><44%>
	Call thyself sister, sweet, for I aim thee.
	Thee will I love and with thee lead my life:
	Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.
	Give me thy hand.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 3><SCENE 2><45%>
	Why, how now, Dromio! where run'st thou so fast?
<SPEECH 57><ACT 3><SCENE 2><45%>
	Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 3><SCENE 2><45%>
	What woman's man? and how besides thyself?
<SPEECH 59><ACT 3><SCENE 2><45%>
	What claim lays she to thee?
<SPEECH 60><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
	What is she?
<SPEECH 61><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
	How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
<SPEECH 62><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
	What complexion is she of?
<SPEECH 63><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
	That's a fault that water will mend.
<SPEECH 64><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	What's her name?
<SPEECH 65><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	Then she bears some breadth?
<SPEECH 66><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	In what part of her body stands Ireland?
<SPEECH 67><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	Where Scotland?

<SPEECH 73><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	Go hie thee presently post to the road:
	An if the wind blow any way from shore,
	I will not harbour in this town to-night:
	If any bark put forth, come to the mart,
	Where I will walk till thou return to me.
	If every one knows us and we know none,
	'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack, and be gone.
<SPEECH 74><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	There's none but witches do inhabit here,
	And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.
	She that doth call me husband, even my soul
	Doth for a wife abhor; but her fair sister,
	Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,
	Of such enchanting presence and discourse,
	Hath almost made me traitor to myself:
	But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,
	I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.
<SPEECH 75><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	Ay, that's my name.
<SPEECH 76><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	What is your will that I shall do with this?
<SPEECH 77><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not
<SPEECH 78><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
	For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.
<SPEECH 79><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	What I should think of this, I cannot tell:
	But this I think, there's no man is so vain
	That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.
	I see, a man here needs not live by shifts,
	When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
	I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay:
	If any ship put out, then straight away.
<SPEECH 80><ACT 4><SCENE 3><62%>
	There's not a man I meet but doth salute me,
	As if I were their well acquainted friend;
	And every one doth call me by my name.
	Some tender money to me; some invite me;
	Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;
	Some offer me commodities to buy:
	Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop
	And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,
	And therewithal, took measure of my body.
	Sure these are but imaginary wiles,
	And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.
<SPEECH 81><ACT 4><SCENE 3><62%>
	What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?
<SPEECH 82><ACT 4><SCENE 3><63%>
	I understand thee not.
<SPEECH 83><ACT 4><SCENE 3><63%>
	What, thou meanest an officer?
<SPEECH 84><ACT 4><SCENE 3><63%>
	Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there any ship puts forth to-night? may we be gone?
<SPEECH 85><ACT 4><SCENE 3><64%>
	The fellow is distract, and so am I;
	And here we wander in illusions:
	Some blessed power deliver us from hence!
<SPEECH 86><ACT 4><SCENE 3><64%>
	Satan, avoid! I charge thee tempt me not!
<SPEECH 87><ACT 4><SCENE 3><64%>
	It is the devil.
<SPEECH 88><ACT 4><SCENE 3><65%>
	Why, Dromio?
<SPEECH 89><ACT 4><SCENE 3><65%>
	Avoid thee, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping?
	Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress:
	I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.
<SPEECH 90><ACT 4><SCENE 3><66%>
	Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.
<SPEECH 91><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
	I see, these witches are afraid of swords.
<SPEECH 92><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
	Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence:
	I long that we were safe and sound aboard.
<SPEECH 93><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
	I will not stay to-night for all the town;
	Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.
<SPEECH 94><ACT 5><SCENE 1><78%>
	I think I had: I never did deny it.
<SPEECH 95><ACT 5><SCENE 1><78%>
	Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
<SPEECH 96><ACT 5><SCENE 1><78%>
	Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:
	I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty
	Against thee presently, if thou dar'st stand.
<SPEECH 97><ACT 5><SCENE 1><95%>
	Ægeon art thou not? or else his ghost?
<SPEECH 98><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
	No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.
<SPEECH 99><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
	I, gentle mistress.
<SPEECH 100><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
	And so do I; yet did she call me so;
	And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
	Did call me brother. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> What I told you then,
	I hope I shall have leisure to make good,
	If this be not a dream I see and hear.
<SPEECH 101><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
	I think it be, sir; I deny it not.
<SPEECH 102><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
	This purse of ducats I receiv'd from you,
	And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.
	I see we still did meet each other's man,
	And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
	And thereupon these errors are arose.
<SPEECH 103><ACT 5><SCENE 1><99%>
	He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio:
	Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon:
	Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
