	You muddy rascal, is that all the comfort you give me?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
	I make them! gluttony and diseases make them; I make them not.

	Can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge full hogshead? there's a whole merchant's venture of Bourdeaux stuff in him: you have not seen a hulk better stuffed in the hold. Come, I'll be friends with thee, Jack: thou art going to the wars; and whether I shall ever see thee again or no, there is nobody cares.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
	Hang him, swaggering rascal! let him not come hither: it is the foul-mouthedest rogue in England.

	So you do, hostess.

	Away, you cut-purse rascal! you filthy bung, away! By this wine, I'll thrust my knife in your mouldy chaps an you play the saucy cuttle with me. Away, you bottle-ale rascal! you basket-hilt stale juggler, you! Since when, I pray you, sir? God's light! with two points on your shoulder? much!

	Captain! thou abominable damned cheater, art thou not ashamed to be called captain? An captains were of my mind, they would truncheon you out for taking their names upon you before you have earned them. You a captain, you slave! for what? for tearing a poor whore's ruff in a bawdy-house? He a captain! Hang him, rogue! He lives upon mouldy stewed prunes and dried cakes. A captain! God's light, these villains will make the word captain as odious as the word 'occupy,' which was an excellent good word before it was ill sorted: therefore captains had need look to it.

	For God's sake, thrust him down stairs! I cannot endure such a fustian rascal.

	Ah, you sweet little rogue, you! Alas, poor ape, how thou sweatest! Come, let me wipe thy face; come on, you whoreson chops. Ah, rogue! i' faith, I love thee. Thou art as valorous as Hector of Troy, worth five of Agamemnon, and ten times better than the Nine Worthies. Ah, villain!
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	Do, an thou darest for thy heart: an thou dost, I'll canvass thee between a pair of sheets.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>

	I'll tell thee what, thou thin man in a censer, I will have you as soundly swinged for this, you blue-bottle rogue! you filthy famished correctioner! if you be not swinged, I'll forswear half-kirtles.
