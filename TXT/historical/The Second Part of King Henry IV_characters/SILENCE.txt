	This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about soldiers?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	We shall all follow, cousin.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	Truly, cousin, I was not there.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	Dead, sir.

	Ah, sirrah! quoth a', we shall
	Do nothing but eat, and make good cheer,

	So merrily
	And ever among so merrily.

	Be merry, be merry, my wife has all;

<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	Who, I? I have been merry twice and once ere now.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
	A cup of wine that's brisk and fine
	And drink unto the leman mine;
	And a merry heart lives long-a.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
	And we shall be merry, now comes in the sweet o' the night.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
	Fill the cup, and let it come;
	I'll pledge you a mile to the bottom.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
	Do me right,
	And dub me knight:
	Samingo
	Is't not so?
<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
	Is't so? Why, then, say an old man can do somewhat.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
	By'r lady, I think a' be, but goodman Puff of Barson.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
	And Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John.
