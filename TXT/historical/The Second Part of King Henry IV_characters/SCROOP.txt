	Thus have you heard our cause and known our means;
	And, my most noble friends, I pray you all,
	Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes:
	And first, Lord Marshal, what say you to it?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for, indeed
	It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	That he should draw his several strengths together
	And come against us in full puissance,
	Need not be dreaded.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	Let us on
	And publish the occasion of our arms.
	The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;
	Their over-greedy love hath surfeited.
	A habitation giddy and unsure
	Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.
	O thou fond many! with what loud applause
	Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke
	Before he was what thou wouldst have him be:
	And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,
	Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him
	That thou provok'st thyself to cast him up.
	So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge
	Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard,
	And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,
	And howl'st to find it. What trust is in these times?
	They that, when Richard liv'd, would have him die,
	Are now become enamour'd on his grave:
	Thou, that threw'st dust upon his goodly head,
	When through proud London he came sighing on
	After the admired heels of Bolingbroke,
	Cry'st now, 'O earth! yield us that king again,
	And take thou this!' O, thoughts of men accurst!
	Past and to come seem best; things present worst.

	What is this forest call'd?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 1><57%>
	Here stand, my lords, and send discovers forth,
	To know the numbers of our enemies.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 1><57%>
	'Tis well done.
	My friends and brethren in these great affairs,
	I must acquaint you that I have receiv'd
	New-dated letters from Northumberland;
	Their cold intent, tenour and substance, thus:
	Here doth he wish his person, with such powers
	As might hold sortance with his quality;
	The which he could not levy; whereupon
	He is retir'd, to ripe his growing fortunes,
	To Scotland; and concludes in hearty prayers
	That your attempts may overlive the hazard
	And fearful meeting of their opposite.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 1><58%>
	What well-appointed leader fronts us here?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 1><58%>
	Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace,
	What doth concern your coming.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
	Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.
	Briefly to this end: we are all diseas'd;
	And, with our surfeiting and wanton hours
	Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,
	And we must bleed for it: of which disease
	Our late king, Richard, being infected, died.
	But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,
	I take not on me here as a physician,
	Nor do I as an enemy to peace
	Troop in the throngs of military men;
	But rather show a while like fearful war,
	To diet rank minds sick of happiness
	And purge the obstructions which begin to stop
	Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly:
	I have in equal balance justly weigh'd
	What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,
	And find our griefs heavier than our offences.
	We see which way the stream of time doth run
	And are enforc'd from our most quiet sphere
	By the rough torrent of occasion;
	And have the summary of all our griefs,
	When time shall serve, to show in articles,
	Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,
	And might by no suit gain our audience.
	When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,
	We are denied access unto his person
	Even by those men that most have done us wrong.
	The dangers of the days but newly gone,—
	Whose memory is written on the earth
	With yet appearing blood,—and the examples
	Of every minute's instance, present now,
	Have put us in these ill-beseeming arms;
	Not to break peace, or any branch of it,
	But to establish here a peace indeed,
	Concurring both in name and quality.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
	My brother general, the commonwealth,
	To brother born an household cruelty,
	I make my quarrel in particular.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,
	For this contains our general grievances:
	Each several article herein redress'd;
	All members of our cause, both here and hence,
	That are insinew'd to this action,
	Acquitted by a true substantial form
	And present execution of our wills
	To us and to our purposes consign'd;
	We come within our awful banks again
	And knit our powers to the arm of peace.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	My lord, we will do so.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary
	Of dainty and such picking grievances:
	For he hath found to end one doubt by death
	Revives two greater in the heirs of life;
	And therefore will he wipe his tables clean,
	And keep no tell-tale to his memory
	That may repeat and history his loss
	To new remembrance; for full well he knows
	He cannot so precisely weed this land
	As his misdoubts present occasion:
	His foes are so enrooted with his friends
	That, plucking to unfix an enemy,
	He doth unfasten so and shake a friend.
	So that this land, like an offensive wife,
	That hath enrag'd him on to offer strokes,
	As he is striking, holds his infant up
	And hangs resolv'd correction in the arm
	That was uprear'd to execution.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	'Tis very true:
	And therefore be assur'd, my good lord marshal,
	If we do now make our atonement well,
	Our peace will, like a broken limb united,
	Grow stronger for the breaking.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	Before, and greet his Grace: my lord, we come.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
	Good my Lord of Lancaster,
	I am not here against your father's peace;
	But, as I told my Lord of Westmoreland,
	The time misorder'd doth, in common sense,
	Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,
	To hold our safety up. I sent your Grace
	The parcels and particulars of our grief,—
	The which hath been with scorn shov'd from the court,—
	Whereon this Hydra son of war is born;
	Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep
	With grant of our most just and right desires,
	And true obedience, of this madness cur'd,
	Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	I take your princely word for these redresses.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	I do not doubt you.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Against ill chances men are ever merry,
	But heaviness foreruns the good event.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	A peace is of the nature of a conquest;
	For then both parties nobly are subdu'd,
	And neither party loser.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	Go, good Lord Hastings,
	And, ere they be dismiss'd, let them march by.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	Will you thus break your faith?
