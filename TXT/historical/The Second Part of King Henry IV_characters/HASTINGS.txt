	Our present musters grow upon the file
	To five-and-twenty thousand men of choice;
	And our supplies live largely in the hope
	Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns
	With an incensed fire of injuries.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	With him, we may.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt
	To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth,
	Should be still-born, and that we now possess'd
	The utmost man of expectation;
	I think we are a body strong enough,
	Even as we are, to equal with the king.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph.
	For his divisions, as the times do brawl,
	Are in three heads: one power against the French,
	And one against Glendower; perforce, a third
	Must take up us: so is the unfirm king
	In three divided, and his coffers sound
	With hollow poverty and emptiness.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	If he should do so,
	He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh
	Baying him at the heels: never fear that.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;
	Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth:
	But who is substituted 'gainst the French
	I have no certain notice.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
	We are time's subjects, and time bids be gone.

	'Tis Gaultree Forest, an't shall please your Grace.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 1><57%>
	We have sent forth already.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 1><57%>
	Now, what news?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	Hath the Prince John a full commission,
	In very ample virtue of his father,
	To hear and absolutely to determine
	Of what conditions we shall stand upon?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	Fear you not that: if we can make our peace
	Upon such large terms, and so absolute
	As our condition shall consist upon,
	Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods
	On late offenders, that he now doth lack
	The very instruments of chastisement;
	So that his power, like to a fangless lion,
	May offer, but not hold.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	And though we here fall down,
	We have supplies to second our attempt:
	If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;
	And so success of mischief shall be born,
	And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up
	Whiles England shall have generation.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	</STAGE DIR> Go, captain, and deliver to the army
	This news of peace: let them have pay, and part:
	I know it will well please them: hie thee, captain.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	My lord, our army is dispers'd already:
	Like youthful steers unyok'd, they take their courses
	East, west, north, south; or, like a school broke up,
	Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place.
