	My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	What are they that fly there?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 6><76%>
	My liege, it is young Henry, Earl of Richmond.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 6><76%>
	My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;
	For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,
	And we shall have more wars before't be long.
	As Henry's late presaging prophecy
	Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,
	So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts
	What may befall him to his harm and ours:
	Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,
	Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,
	Till storms be past of civil enmity.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 6><77%>
	It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.
	Come, therefore, let's about it speedily.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
	And do expect him here some two hours hence.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:
	The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!
<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
	Ah! Warwick, Warwick, wert thou as we are,
	We might recover all our loss again.
	The queen from France hath brought a puissant power;
	Even now we heard the news. Ah! couldst thou fly.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
	Ah! Warwick, Montague hath breath'd his last;
	And to the latest gasp, cried out for Warwick,
	And said, 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'
	And more he would have said; and more he spoke,
	Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,
	That mought not be distinguish'd: but at last
	I well might hear, deliver'd with a groan,
	'O! farewell, Warwick!'
<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 4><91%>
	And he, that will not fight for such a hope,
	Go home to bed, and, like the owl by day,
	If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 4><91%>
	But he's deceiv'd; we are in readiness.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 5><92%>
	Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.
