	Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer—
	To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.
	Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father,

	To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,

	Come, cousin; you shall be the messenger.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 2><27%>
	Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wrack:
	To see this sight, it irks my very soul.

	Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
	Inferring arguments of mighty force.
	But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear

	Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
	I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;
	And would my father had left me no more!
	For all the rest is held at such a rate
	As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep
	Than in possession any jot of pleasure.

	This battle fares like to the morning's war,
	When dying clouds contend with growing light,
	What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
	Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
	Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
	Forc'd by the tide to combat with the wind;
	Now sways it that way, like the self-same sea
	Forc'd to retire by fury of the wind:
	Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;
	Now one the better, then another best;
	Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
	Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:
	So is the equal poise of this fell war.
	Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
	To whom God will, there be the victory!
	For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
	Have chid me from the battle; swearing both
	They prosper best of all when I am thence.
	Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;
	For what is in this world but grief and woe?
	O God! methinks it were a happy life,
	To be no better than a homely swain;
	To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
	To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
	Thereby to see the minutes how they run,
	How many make the hour full complete;
	How many hours bring about the day;
	How many days will finish up the year;
	How many years a mortal man may live.
	When this is known, then to divide the times:
	So many hours must I tend my flock;
	So many hours must I take my rest;
	So many hours must I contemplate;
	So many hours must I sport myself;
	So many days my ewes have been with young;
	So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean;
	So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
	So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
	Pass'd over to the end they were created,
	Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
	Ah! what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
	Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade
	To shepherds, looking on their silly sheep,
	Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
	To kings, that fear their subjects' treachery?
	O, yes! it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
	And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds,
	His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle,
	His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
	All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
	Is far beyond a prince's delicates,
	His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
	His body couched in a curious bed,
	When care, mistrust, and treason wait on him.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 5><37%>
	O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
	Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,
	Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.

	Be blind with tears, and break o'ercharg'd with grief.

	Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:
	No bending knee will call thee Cæsar now,

	For how can I help them, and not myself?

<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	My queen and son are gone to France for aid;
	And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick
	Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister
	To wife for Edward. If this news be true,
	Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;
	For Warwick is a subtle orator,
	And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.
	By this account then Margaret may win him,
	For she's a woman to be pitied much:
	Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;
	Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;
	The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;
	And Nero will be tainted with remorse,
	To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.
	Ay, but she's come to beg; Warwick, to give:
	She on his left side craving aid for Henry;
	He on his right asking a wife for Edward.
	She weeps, and says her Henry is depos'd;
	He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;
	That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more:
	Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,
	Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
	And in conclusion wins the king from her,
	With promise of his sister, and what else,
	To strengthen and support King Edward's place.
	O Margaret! thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,
	Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	More than I seem, and less than I was born to:

	Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?

	And as the air blows it to me again,
	Obeying with my wind when I do blow,
	And yielding to another when it blows,
	Commanded always by the greater gust;
	Such is the lightness of you common men.
	But do not break your oaths; for of that sin
	My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.
	Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;
	And be you kings: command, and I'll obey.

	Master lieutenant, now that God and friends
	Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,
	And turn'd my captive state to liberty,
	My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,
	At our enlargement what are thy due fees?
<SPEECH 54><ACT 4><SCENE 6><74%>
	For what, lieutenant? for well using me?
	Nay, be thou sure, I'll well requite thy kindness,
	For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;
	Ay, such a pleasure as encaged birds
	Conceive, when, after many moody thoughts
	At last by notes of household harmony
	They quite forget their loss of liberty.
	But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,
	And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;
	He was the author, thou the instrument.
	Therefore, that I may conquer Fortune's spite
	By living low, where Fortune cannot hurt me,
	And that the people of this blessed land
	May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,
	Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,
	I here resign my government to thee,
	For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 4><SCENE 6><75%>
	Warwick and Clarence, give me both your hands:
	Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
	That no dissension hinder government:
	I make you both protectors of this land,
	While I myself will lead a private life,
	And in devotion spend my latter days,
	To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 4><SCENE 6><75%>
	But, with the first of all your chief affairs,
	Let me entreat, for I command no more,
	That Margaret your queen, and my son Edward,
	Be sent for, to return from France with speed:
	For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear
	My joy of liberty is half eclips'd.

	Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?
	Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
	Should not be able to encounter mine.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 4><SCENE 8><81%>
	That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:
	I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,
	Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;
	My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,
	My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,
	My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;
	I have not been desirous of their wealth;
	Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies,
	Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd.
	Then why should they love Edward more than me?
	No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace:
	And, when the lion fawns upon the lamb,
	The lamb will never cease to follow him.
<SPEECH 64><ACT 5><SCENE 6><95%>
	Ay, my good lord:—my lord, I should say rather;
	'Tis sin to flatter, 'good' was little better:

	And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.
	Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,
	And yet brought forth less than a mother's hope;
	To wit an indigest deformed lump,
	Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.
	Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,
	To signify thou cam'st to bite the world:
	And, if the rest be true which I have heard,
	Thou cam'st—
