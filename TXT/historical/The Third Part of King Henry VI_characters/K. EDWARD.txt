<SPEECH 1><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field
	This lady's husband, Sir John Grey, was slain,
	His lands then seiz'd on by the conqueror:
	Her suit is now, to repossess those lands;
	Which we in justice cannot well deny,
	Because in quarrel of the house of York
	The worthy gentleman did lose his life.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	It were no less: but yet I'll make a pause.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	Widow, we will consider of your suit,
	And come some other time to know our mind.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	Now, tell me, madam, do you love your children?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	And would you not do much to do them good?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	But you will take exceptions to my boon.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	An easy task: 'tis but to love a king.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	Why then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	But stay thee; 'tis the fruits of love I mean.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
	What love think'st thou I sue so much to get?
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	But now you partly may perceive my mind.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;
	No, if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	</STAGE DIR> Her looks do argue her replete with modesty;
	Her words do show her wit incomparable;
	All her perfections challenge sovereignty:
	One way or other, she is for a king;
	And she shall be my love, or else my queen.
	Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee,
	I speak no more than what my soul intends;
	And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
	Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;
	And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor,
	Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing
	To be the father unto many sons.
	Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	You'd think it strange if I should marry her.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	Why, Clarence, to myself.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both
	Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	See that he be convey'd unto the Tower:
	And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,
	To question of his apprehension.
	Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	Now, brother Clarence, how like you our choice,
	That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	Suppose they take offence without a cause,
	They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,
	Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
	Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey
	Should not become my wife and England's queen:
	And you too, Somerset and Montague,
	Speak freely what you think.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
	What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeas'd
	By such invention as I can devise?
<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
	Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;
	And for this once my will shall stand for law.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	Alas, poor Clarence, is it for a wife
	That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,
	And not be tied unto his brother's will.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
	What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,
	So long as Edward is thy constant friend,
	And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?
	Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,
	Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
	Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,
	And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	Now, messenger, what letters or what news
	From France?
<SPEECH 43><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,
	Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.
	What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?
<SPEECH 44><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
	Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.
	But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?
<SPEECH 45><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
	I blame not her, she could say little less;
	She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?
	For I have heard that she was there in place.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
	Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
	But what said Warwick to these injuries?
<SPEECH 47><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
	Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
	Well, I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:
	They shall have wars, and pay for their presumption.
	But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?
<SPEECH 48><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
	Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!
	Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen,
	And haste is needful in this desperate case.
	Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf
	Go levy men, and make prepare for war:
	They are already, or quickly will be landed:
	Myself in person will straight follow you,
	But ere I go, Hastings and Montague,
	Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
	Are near to Warwick by blood, and by alliance:
	Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?
	If it be so, then both depart to him;
	I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:
	But if you mind to hold your true obedience,
	Give me assurance with some friendly vow
	That I may never have you in suspect.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
	Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
<SPEECH 50><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
	Why, so! then am I sure of victory.
	Now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour
	Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted last,
	Thou call'dst me king!
<SPEECH 52><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	Yea, brother of Clarence, art thou here too?
	Nay, then, I see that Edward needs must down.
	Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,
	Of thee thyself, and all thy complices,
	Edward will always bear himself as king:
	Though Fortune's malice overthrow my state,
	My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
	What fates impose, that men must needs abide;
	It boots not to resist both wind and tide.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
	Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.
	Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
	Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?
<SPEECH 55><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
	But whither shall we then?
<SPEECH 56><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
	Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
	Huntsman, what sayst thou? wilt thou go along?
<SPEECH 58><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
	Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown,
	And pray that I may repossess the crown.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 4><SCENE 7><77%>
	Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
	Yet thus far Fortune maketh us amends,
	And says, that once more I shall interchange
	My waned state for Henry's regal crown.
	Well have we pass'd, and now repass'd the seas,
	And brought desired help from Burgundy:
	What then remains, we being thus arriv'd
	From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,
	But that we enter, as into our dukedom?
<SPEECH 60><ACT 4><SCENE 7><77%>
	Tush, man! abodements must not now affright us.
	By fair or foul means we must enter in,
	For hither will our friends repair to us.
<SPEECH 61><ACT 4><SCENE 7><77%>
	But, Master Mayor, if Henry be your king,
	Yet Edward, at the least, is Duke of York.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 4><SCENE 7><78%>
	Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
	As being well content with that alone.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 4><SCENE 7><78%>
	So, Master Mayor: these gates must not be shut
	But in the night, or in the time of war.
	What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;
	For Edward will defend the town and thee,
	And all those friends that deign to follow me.
<SPEECH 64><ACT 4><SCENE 7><78%>
	Welcome, Sir John! but why come you in arms?
<SPEECH 65><ACT 4><SCENE 7><78%>
	Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
	Our title to the crown, and only claim
	Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.
<SPEECH 66><ACT 4><SCENE 7><79%>
	Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile; and we'll debate
	By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.
<SPEECH 67><ACT 4><SCENE 7><79%>
	When we grow stronger then we'll make our claim;
	Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.
<SPEECH 68><ACT 4><SCENE 7><79%>
	Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,
	And Henry but usurps the diadem.
<SPEECH 69><ACT 4><SCENE 7><80%>
	Thanks, brave Montgomery;—and thanks unto you all:
	If Fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness.
	Now, for this night, let's harbour here in York;
	And when the morning sun shall raise his car
	Above the border of this horizon,
	We'll forward towards Warwick, and his mates;
	For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.
	Ah, froward Clarence, how evil it beseems thee
	To flatter Henry, and forsake thy brother!
	Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick.
	Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day;
	And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.
<SPEECH 70><ACT 4><SCENE 8><82%>
	Seize on the shame-fac'd Henry! bear him hence:
	And once again proclaim us King of England.
	You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow:
	Now stops thy spring; my sea shall suck them dry,
	And swell so much the higher by their ebb.
	Hence with him to the Tower! let him not speak.
	And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course,
	Where peremptory Warwick now remains:
	The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay,
	Cold biting winter mars our hop'd-for hay.
<SPEECH 71><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.
<SPEECH 72><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,
	Speak gentle words, and humbly bend thy knee?—
	Call Edward king, and at his hands beg mercy?
	And he shall pardon thee these outrages.
<SPEECH 73><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.
<SPEECH 74><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner;
	And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this,
	What is the body, when the head is off?
<SPEECH 75><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	'Tis even so: yet you are Warwick still.
<SPEECH 76><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend;
	This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair,
	Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,
	Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood:
	'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.'
<SPEECH 77><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	So other foes may set upon our backs.
	Stand we in good array; for they no doubt
	Will issue out again and bid us battle:
	If not, the city being but of small defence,
	We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.
<SPEECH 78><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	The harder match'd, the greater victory:
	My mind presageth happy gain, and conquest.
<SPEECH 79><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	Now welcome more, and ten times more belov'd,
	Than if thou never hadst deserv'd our hate.
<SPEECH 80><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town, and fight?
	Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?
<SPEECH 81><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way.
	Lords, to the field; Saint George and victory!
<SPEECH 82><ACT 5><SCENE 2><87%>
	So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear;
	For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.
	Now Montague, sit fast; I seek for thee,
	That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.
<SPEECH 83><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
	Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,
	And we are grac'd with wreaths of victory.
	But in the midst of this bright-shining day,
	I spy a black, suspicious, threat'ning cloud,
	That will encounter with our glorious sun,
	Ere he attain his easeful western bed:
	I mean, my lords, those powers that the queen
	Hath rais'd in Gallia, have arriv'd our coast,
	And, as we hear, march on to fight with us.
<SPEECH 84><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	We are advertis'd by our loving friends
	That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury.
	We, having now the best at Barnet field,
	Will thither straight, for willingness rids way;
	And, as we march, our strength will be augmented
	In every county as we go along.
	Strike up the drum! cry 'Courage!' and away.
<SPEECH 85><ACT 5><SCENE 4><91%>
	Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,
	Which, by the heavens' assistance, and your strength,
	Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.
	I need not add more fuel to your fire,
	For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out:
	Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords.
<SPEECH 86><ACT 5><SCENE 5><92%>
	Now, here a period of tumultuous broils.
	Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight:
	For Somerset, off with his guilty head.
	Go, bear them hence; I will not hear them speak.
<SPEECH 87><ACT 5><SCENE 5><92%>
	Is proclamation made, that who finds Edward
	Shall have a high reward, and he his life?
<SPEECH 88><ACT 5><SCENE 5><93%>
	Bring forth the gallant: let us hear him speak.
	What! can so young a thorn begin to prick?
	Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make,
	For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,
	And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?
<SPEECH 89><ACT 5><SCENE 5><93%>
	Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.
<SPEECH 90><ACT 5><SCENE 5><93%>
	Take that, the likeness of this railer here.
<SPEECH 91><ACT 5><SCENE 5><94%>
	Hold, Richard, hold! for we have done too much.
<SPEECH 92><ACT 5><SCENE 5><94%>
	What! doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.
<SPEECH 93><ACT 5><SCENE 5><94%>
	Away with her! go, bear her hence perforce.
<SPEECH 94><ACT 5><SCENE 5><95%>
	Away, I say! I charge ye, bear her hence.
<SPEECH 95><ACT 5><SCENE 5><95%>
	Where's Richard gone?
<SPEECH 96><ACT 5><SCENE 5><95%>
	He's sudden if a thing comes in his head.
	Now march we hence: discharge the common sort
	With pay and thanks, and let's away to London
	And see our gentle queen how well she fares;
	By this, I hope, she hath a son for me.
<SPEECH 97><ACT 5><SCENE 7><98%>
	Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
	Re-purchas'd with the blood of enemies.
	What valiant foemen like to autumn's corn,
	Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!
	Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd
	For hardy and undoubted champions;
	Two Cliffords, as the father and the son;
	And two Northumberlands: two braver men
	Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;
	With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,
	That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion,
	And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
	Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat,
	And made our footstool of security.
	Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
	Young Ned, for thee thine uncles and myself
	Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night;
	Went all a-foot in summer's scalding heat,
	That thou might'st repossess the crown in peace;
	And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.
<SPEECH 98><ACT 5><SCENE 7><99%>
	Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
	And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.
<SPEECH 99><ACT 5><SCENE 7><99%>
	Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.
<SPEECH 100><ACT 5><SCENE 7><100%>
	Now am I seated as my soul delights,
	Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.
<SPEECH 101><ACT 5><SCENE 7><100%>
	Away with her, and waft her hence to France.
	And now what rests but that we spend the time
	With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,
	Such as befit the pleasure of the court?
	Sound, drums and trumpets! farewell, sour annoy!
	For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.
