	Under this thick-grown hrake we'll shroud ourselves;
	For through this laund anon the deer will come;
	And in this covert will we make our stand,
	Culling the principal of all the deer.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow
	Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.
	Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:
	And, for the time shall not seem tedious,
	I'll tell thee what befell me on a day
	In this self place where now we mean to stand.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:
	This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	No;
	For we were subjects but while you were king.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	We charge you, in God's name, and in the king's,
	To go with us unto the officers.
