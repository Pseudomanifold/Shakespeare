	</STAGE DIR> Richard, thy wife, that wretched Anne thy wife,

	</STAGE DIR> The first was I that help'd thee to the crown;
	The last was I that felt thy tyranny.
	O! in the battle think on Buckingham,
	And die in terror of thy guiltiness!
	Dream on, dream on, of bloody deeds and death:
	Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!
	</STAGE DIR> I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid:
	But cheer thy heart, and be thou not dismay'd:
	God and good angels fight on Richmond's side;
	And Richard falls in height of all his pride.
