	Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
	But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
	That were the cause of my imprisonment.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	More pity that the eagles should be mew'd,
	While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	No news so bad abroad as this at home;
	The king is sickly, weak, and melancholy,
	And his physicians fear him mightily.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	He is.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	O! 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
	And the most merciless, that e'er was heard of.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
	Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 3><20%>
	My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
	So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
	So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
	And so swear I.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 2><36%>
	And so say I.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	On what occasion, God he knows, not I,
	The queen your mother, and your brother York,
	Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince
	Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace,
	But by his mother was perforce withheld.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	I go, my lord.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
	</STAGE DIR> Who knocks?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
	</STAGE DIR> What is't o'clock?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
	Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights?
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
	What then?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
	Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
	Bid him not fear the separated councils:
	His honour and myself are at the one,
	And at the other is my good friend Catesby;
	Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
	Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
	Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:
	And for his dreams, I wonder he's so fond
	To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers.
	To fly the boar before the boar pursues,
	Were to incense the boar to follow us
	And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
	Go, bid thy master rise and come to me;
	And we will both together to the Tower,
	Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring.
	What news, what news, in this our tottering state?
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
	Before I'll see the crown so foul misplac'd.
	But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
	Because they have been still my adversaries;
	But that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,
	To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
	God knows I will not do it, to the death.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
	That they which brought me in my master's hate,
	I live to look upon their tragedy.
	Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older,
	I'll send some packing that yet think not on't.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
	With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so 'twill do
	With some men else, who think themselves as safe
	As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear
	To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	I know they do, and I have well deserv'd it.
	Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
	Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?
<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	My lord, I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
	And never, in my days, I do protest,
	Was it so precious to me as 'tis now.
	Think you, but that I know our state secure,
	I would be so triumphant as I am?
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
	To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
	How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
	Than when I met thee last where now we meet:
	Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,
	By the suggestion of the queen's allies;
	But now, I tell thee,—keep it to thyself,—
	This day those enemies are put to death,
	And I in better state than e'er I was.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
	I am in your debt for your last exercise;
	Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
	The men you talk of came into my mind.
	What, go you toward the Tower?
<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	Nay, like enough, for I stay dinner there.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	I'll wait upon your lordship.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 3><SCENE 4><50%>
	My lords, at once: the cause why we are met
	Is to determine of the coronation:
	In God's name, speak, when is the royal day?
<SPEECH 37><ACT 3><SCENE 4><50%>
	I thank his Grace, I know he loves me well;
	But, for his purpose in the coronation,
	I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
	His gracious pleasure any way therein:
	But you, my noble lords, may name the time;
	And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
	Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 4><51%>
	His Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning:
	There's some conceit or other likes him well,
	When that he bids good morrow with such spirit.
	I think there's never a man in Christendom
	Can lesser hide his hate or love than he;
	For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 4><52%>
	Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
	For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 4><52%>
	The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord,
	Makes me most forward in this princely presence
	To doom th' offenders, whosoe'er they be:
	I say, my lord, they have deserved death.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 4><52%>
	If they have done this thing, my noble lord,—
<SPEECH 42><ACT 3><SCENE 4><52%>
	Woe, woe, for England! not a whit for me;
	For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
	Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
	And I did scorn it, and disdain'd to fly.
	Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
	And startled when he looked upon the Tower,
	As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
	O! now I need the priest that spake to me:
	I now repent I told the pursuivant,
	As too triumphing, how mine enemies
	To-day at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd
	And I myself secure in grace and favour.
	O Margaret, Margaret! now thy heavy curse
	Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 4><53%>
	O momentary grace of mortal man,
	Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
	Who builds his hope in air of your good looks,
	Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast;
	Ready with every nod to tumble down
	Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 4><53%>
	O bloody Richard! miserable England!
	I prophesy the fearfull'st time to thee
	That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
	Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head:
	They smile at me who shortly shall be dead.
