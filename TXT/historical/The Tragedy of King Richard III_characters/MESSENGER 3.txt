<SPEECH 1><ACT 4><SCENE 4><85%>
	My lord, the army of great Buckinghamâ€”
<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 4><85%>
	The news I have to tell your majesty
	Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters,
	Buckingham's army is dispers'd and scatter'd;
	And he himself wander'd away alone,
	No man knows whither.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 4><85%>
	Such proclamation hath been made, my liege.
