<SPEECH 1><ACT 3><SCENE 1><40%>
	No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
	Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy:
	I want more uncles here to welcome me.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	God keep me from false friends! but they were none.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.
	I thought my mother and my brother York
	Would long ere this have met us on the way:
	Fie! what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not
	To tell us whether they will come or no.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
	Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
	Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	I do not like the Tower, of any place:
	Did Julius Cæsar build that place, my lord?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	Is it upon record, or else reported
	Successively from age to age, he built it?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	But say, my lord, it were not register'd,
	Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
	As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
	Even to the general all-ending day.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	What say you, uncle?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	That Julius Cæsar was a famous man;
	With what his valour did enrich his wit,
	His wit set down to make his valour live:
	Death makes no conquest of this conqueror,
	For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
	I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,—
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	An if I live until I be a man,
	I'll win our ancient right in France again,
	Or die a soldier, as I liv'd a king.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:
	Too late he died that might have kept that title,
	Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	A beggar, brother?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	My Lord of York will still be cross in talk.
	Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	My Lord Protector needs will have it so.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	I fear no uncles dead.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	An if they live, I hope, I need not fear.
	But come, my lord; and, with a heavy heart,
	Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.
