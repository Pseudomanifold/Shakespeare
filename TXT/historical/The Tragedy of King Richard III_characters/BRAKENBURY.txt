	I beseech your Graces both to pardon me;
	His majesty hath straitly given in charge
	That no man shall have private conference,
	Of what degree soever, with your brother.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	What one, my lord?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	I beseech your Grace to pardon me; and withal
	Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 4><21%>
	Why looks your Grace so heavily to-day?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 4><21%>
	What was your dream, my lord? I pray you, tell me.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 4><22%>
	Had you such leisure in the time of death
	To gaze upon those secrets of the deep?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 4><22%>
	Awak'd you not with this sore agony?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 4><23%>
	No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;
	I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 4><23%>
	I will, my lord. God give your Grace good rest!
	Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
	Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.
	Princes have but their titles for their glories,
	An outward honour for an inward toil;
	And, for unfelt imaginations,
	They often feel a world of restless cares:
	So that, between their titles and low names,
	There's nothing differs but the outward fame.

	What wouldst thou, fellow? and how cam'st thou hither?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 4><23%>
	What! so brief?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	I am, in this, commanded to deliver
	The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
	I will not reason what is meant hereby,
	Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.
	There lies the duke asleep, and there the keys.
	I'll to the king; and signify to him
	That thus I have resign'd to you my charge.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
	I may not suffer you to visit them:
	The king hath strictly charg'd the contrary.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	I mean the Lord Protector.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
	No, madam, no, I may not leave it so:
	I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.
