	My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days

	Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
	Of the young prince your son: send straight for him;
	Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives.
	Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
	And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.

	Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?

	And so in me; and so, I think, in all:
	Yet, since it is but green, it should be put

	O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison!
	Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
	Within the guilty closure of thy walls
	Richard the Second here was hack'd to death;
	And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,
	We give thee up our guitless blood to drink.

	Then curs'd she Richard, then curs'd she Buckingham,
	Then curs'd she Hastings: O! remember, God,
	To hear her prayer for them, as now for us;
	And for my sister and her princely sons,
	Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
	Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 3><50%>
	Come, Grey, come, Vaughan; let us here embrace:
	And take our leave until we meet in heaven.
