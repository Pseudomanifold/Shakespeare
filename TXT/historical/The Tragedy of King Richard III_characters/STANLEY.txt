	I do beseech you, either not believe
	The envious slanders of her false accusers;
	Or, if she be accus'd on true report,
	Bear with her weakness, which, I think, proceeds
	From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><13%>
	But now the Duke of Buckingham and I,
	Are come from visiting his majesty.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><31%>
	A boon, my sov'reign, for my service done!
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><31%>
	I will not rise, unless your highness hear me.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><31%>
	The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
	Who slew to-day a riotous gentleman
	Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	My lord, good morrow; good morrow Catesby:
	You may jest on, but by the holy rood,
	I do not like these several councils, I.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
	Were jocund and suppos'd their state was sure,
	And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
	But yet you see how soon the day o'ercast.
	This sudden stab of rancour I misdoubt;
	Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
	What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	They, for their truth, might better wear their heads,
	Than some that have accus'd them wear their hats.
	But come, my lord, let's away.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 4><50%>
	It is; and wants but nomination.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 4><51%>
	We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
	To-morrow, in my judgment, is too sudden;
	For I myself am not so well provided
	As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 4><51%>
	What of his heart perceiv'd you in his face
	By any livelihood he show'd to-day?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
	Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,
	And I'll salute your Grace of York as mother,
	And reverend looker-on of two fair queens.
	</STAGE DIR> Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,
	There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
	Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
	</STAGE DIR> Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
	You shall have letters from me to my son
	In your behalf, to meet you on the way:
	Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
	Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	Know, my loving lord,
	The Marquess Dorset, as I hear, is fled
	To Richmond, in the parts where he abides.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 4><83%>
	None good, my liege, to please you with the hearing;
	Nor none so bad but well may be reported.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 4><83%>
	Richmond is on the seas.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton,
	He makes for England, here to claim the crown.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	No, my good lord; therefore mistrust me not.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	They have not been commanded, mighty king:
	Pleaseth your majesty to give me leave,
	I'll muster up my friends, and meet your Grace,
	Where and what time your majesty shall please.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	Most mighty sovereign,
	You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful.
	I never was nor never will be false.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 4><84%>
	So deal with him as I prove true to you.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 5><86%>
	Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
	That in the sty of this most bloody boar
	My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:
	If I revolt, off goes young George's head;
	The fear of that holds off my present aid.
	So, get thee gone: commend me to thy lord.
	Withal, say that the queen hath heartily consented
	He should espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
	But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?
<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 5><86%>
	What men of name resort to him?
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 5><86%>
	Well, hie thee to thy lord; I kiss his hand:
	My letter will resolve him of my mind.
	Farewell.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,
	Who prays continually for Richmond's good:
	So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
	And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
	In brief, for so the season bids us be,
	Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
	And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
	Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
	I, as I may,—that which I would I cannot,—
	With best advantage will deceive the time,
	And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:
	But on thy side I may not be too forward,
	Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
	Be executed in his father's sight.
	Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time
	Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
	And ample interchange of sweet discourse,
	Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon:
	God give us leisure for these rites of love!
	Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!
<SPEECH 32><ACT 5><SCENE 4><99%>
	Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee!
	Lo! here, this long-usurped royalty
	From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
	Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:
	Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 5><SCENE 4><99%>
	He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;
	Whither, if you please, we may withdraw us.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 4><99%>
	John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
	Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
