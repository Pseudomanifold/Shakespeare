	James Tyrrell, and your most obedient subject.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Prove me, my gracious lord.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Please you; but I had rather kill two enemies.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Let me have open means to come to them,
	And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	I will dispatch it straight.

	The tyrannous and bloody act is done;
	The most arch deed of piteous massacre
	That ever yet this land was guilty of.
	Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn
	To do this piece of ruthless butchery,
	Albeit they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
	Melting with tenderness and mild compassion,
	Wept like to children in their death's sad story.
	'Oh! thus,' quoth Dighton, 'lay the gentle babes:'
	'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another
	Within their alabaster innocent arms:
	Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
	Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
	A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
	Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost chang'd my mind;
	But, O, the devil'â€”there the villain stopp'd;
	When Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
	The most replenished sweet work of nature,
	That from the prime creation e'er she fram'd.'
	Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse;
	They could not speak; and so I left them both,
	To bear this tidings to the bloody king:
	And here he comes.
	All health, my sovereign lord!

	The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;

	I humbly take my leave.
