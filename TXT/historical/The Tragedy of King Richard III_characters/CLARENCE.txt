	His majesty,
	Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
	This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	Because my name is George.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
	As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
	He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
	And from the cross-row plucks the letter G,
	And says a wizard told him that by G
	His issue disinherited should be;
	And, for my name of George begins with G,
	It follows in his thought that I am he.
	These, as I learn, and such like toys as these,
	Have mov'd his highness to commit me now.

	By heaven, I think there is no man secure
	But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
	That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
	Heard you not what a humble suppliant
	Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?

	We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	I must perforce: farewell.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 4><21%>
	O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
	So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
	That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
	I would not spend another such a night,
	Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
	So full of dismal terror was the time.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 4><21%>
	Methought that I had broken from the Tower,
	And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
	And in my company my brother Gloucester,
	Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
	Upon the hatches: thence we look'd toward England,
	And cited up a thousand heavy times,
	During the wars of York and Lancaster,
	That had befall'n us. As we pac'd along
	Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
	Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
	Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
	Into the tumbling billows of the main.
	Lord, Lord! methought what pain it was to drown:
	What dreadful noise of water in mine ears!
	What sights of ugly death within mine eyes!
	Methought I saw a thousand fearful wracks;
	A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
	Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
	Inestimable stones, unvalu'd jewels,
	All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea.
	Some lay in dead men's skulls; and in those holes
	Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
	As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
	That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
	And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 4><22%>
	Methought I had; and often did I strive
	To yield the ghost; but still the envious flood
	Stopt in my soul, and would not let it forth
	To find the empty, vast, and wandering air;
	But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
	Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 4><22%>
	No, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
	O! then began the tempest to my soul.
	I pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
	With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
	Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
	The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
	Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
	Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
	Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
	And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
	A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
	Dabbled in blood; and he shriek'd out aloud,
	'Clarence is come,—false, fleeting, perjur'd Clarence,
	That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;—
	Seize on him! Furies, take him unto torment.'
	With that, methought, a legion of foul fiends
	Environ'd me, and howled in mine ears
	Such hideous cries, that, with the very noise
	I trembling wak'd, and, for a season after
	Could not believe but that I was in hell,
	Such terrible impression made my dream.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 4><23%>
	O Brakenbury! I have done these things
	That now give evidence against my soul,
	For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me.
	O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
	But thou wilt be aveng'd on my misdeeds,
	Yet execute thy wrath on me alone:
	O! spare my guiltless wife and my poor children.
	I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
	My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	In God's name, what art thou?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	But not, as I am, royal.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	How darkly, and how deadly dost thou speak!
	Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
	Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	To murder me?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 4><26%>
	You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
	And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
	Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 4><26%>
	I shall be reconcil'd to him again.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 4><26%>
	Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
	To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
	Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?
	What lawful quest have given their verdict up
	Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounc'd
	The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
	Before I be convict by course of law,
	To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
	I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
	By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
	That you depart and lay no hands on me;
	The deed you undertake is damnable.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 4><26%>
	Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
	Hath in the table of his law commanded
	That thou shalt do no murder: will you, then,
	Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
	Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hand,
	To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 4><26%>
	Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
	For Edward, for my brother, for his sake:
	He sends you not to murder me for this;
	For in that sin he is as deep as I.
	If God will be avenged for the deed,
	O! know you yet, he doth it publicly:
	Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
	He needs no indirect or lawless course
	To cut off those that have offended him.

	If you do love my brother, hate not me;
	I am his brother, and I love him well.
	If you are hir'd for meed, go back again,

	Who shall reward you better for my life
	Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 4><27%>
	O, no! he loves me, and he holds me dear:

	Tell him, when that our princely father York
	Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
	And charg'd us from his soul to love each other,
	He little thought of this divided friendship:

<SPEECH 28><ACT 1><SCENE 4><27%>
	O! do not slander him, for he is kind.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 1><SCENE 4><27%>
	It cannot be; for he bewept my fortune,
	And hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
	That he would labour my delivery.

	Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
	To counsel me to make my peace with God,

	O! sirs, consider, he that set you on
	To do this deed, will hate you for the deed.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 1><SCENE 4><28%>
	Relent and save your souls.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 1><SCENE 4><28%>
	Not to relent, is beastly, savage, devilish.
	Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
	Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
	If two such murd'rers as yourselves came to you,
	Would not entreat for life?
	My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks;
	O! if thine eye be not a flatterer,
	Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
	As you would beg, were you in my distress:
	A begging prince what beggar pities not?
