	'Tis better, sir, than to be tedious.â€”
	Let him see our commission, and talk no more.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	What! shall we stab him as he sleeps?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till the judgment-day.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind of remorse in me.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be damn'd for killing him, from the which no warrant can defend me.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	So I am, to let him live.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	Nay, I prithee, stay a little: I hope my holy humour will change; it was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	Some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	'Zounds! he dies: I had forgot the reward.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
	'Tis no matter; let it go: there's few or none will entertain it.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	I'll not meddle with it; it makes a man a coward; a man cannot steal, but it accuseth him; a man cannot swear, but it checks him; a man cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit, that mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of obstacles; it made me once restore a purse of gold that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it; it is turned out of all towns and cities for a dangerous thing; and every man that means to live well, endeavours to trust to himself and live without it.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	Take the devil in thy mind, and believe him not: he would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	Spoke like a tall fellow that respects his reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	O, excellent device! make a sop of him.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	Strike!
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 4><26%>
	Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 4><26%>
	And he that hath commanded is our king.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 4><26%>
	And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
	For false forswearing and for murder too:
	Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight
	In quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 4><26%>
	Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 4><27%>
	You are deceiv'd, your brother Gloucester hates you.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 4><27%>
	Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 4><28%>
	What shall we do?
<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 4><28%>
	Look behind you, my lord.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 4><28%>
	A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!
	How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
	Of this most grievous murder.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 4><28%>
	I would he knew that I had sav'd his brother!
	Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
	For I repent me that the duke is slain.
