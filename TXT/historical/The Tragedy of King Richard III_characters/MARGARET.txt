	</STAGE DIR> Out, devil! I remember them too well:
	Thou kill'dst my husband Henry in the Tower,
	And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	Ay, and much better blood than his, or thine.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	A murderous villain, and so still thou art.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	Which God revenge!
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave this world,
	Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	As little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
	For I am she, and altogether joyless.
	I can no longer hold me patient.
	Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
	In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
	Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
	If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,
	Yet that, by you depos'd, you quake like rebels?
	Ah! gentle villain, do not turn away.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
	That will I make before I let thee go.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
	Than death can yield me here by my abode.
	A husband and a son thou ow'st to me;
	And thou, a kingdom; all of you, allegiance:
	This sorrow that I have by right is yours,
	And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	What! were you snarling all before I came,
	Ready to catch each other by the throat,
	And turn you all your hatred now on me?
	Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven
	That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
	Their kingdom's loss, my woeful banishment,
	Should all but answer for that peevish brat?
	Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
	Why then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
	Though not by war, by surfeit die your king,
	As ours by murder, to make him a king!
	Edward, thy son, that now is Prince of Wales,
	For Edward, my son, which was Prince of Wales,
	Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
	Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
	Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
	Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss,
	And see another, as I see thee now,
	Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
	Long die thy happy days before thy death;
	And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,
	Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
	Rivers, and Dorset, you were standers by,—
	And so wast thou, Lord Hastings,—when my son
	Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
	That none of you may live your natural age,
	But by some unlook'd accident cut off.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
	If heaven have any grievous plague in store
	Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
	O! let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
	And then hurl down their indignation
	On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace.
	The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
	Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv'st
	And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
	No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
	Unless it be while some tormenting dream
	Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
	Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
	Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
	The slave of nature and the son of hell!
	Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
	Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
	Thou rag of honour! thou detested—

	Richard!
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	I call thee not.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.
	O! let me make the period to my curse.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
	Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,
	Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
	Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
	The day will come that thou shalt wish for me
	To help thee curse this pois'nous bunch-back'd toad.

	Foul shame upon you! you have all mov'd mine.

	Peace! Master marquess, you are malapert:
	Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
	O! that your young nobility could judge
	What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
	They that stand high have many blasts to shake them,
	And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
	And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
	Witness my son, now in the shade of death;
	Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
	Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
	Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest:
	O God! that seest it, do not suffer it;
	As it was won with blood, lost be it so!
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
	Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
	Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
	And shamefully my hopes by you are butcher'd.
	My charity is outrage, life my shame;

<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
	O princely Buckingham! I'll kiss thy hand,
	In sign of league and amity with thee:
	Now fair befall thee and thy noble house!
	Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
	Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
	I will not think but they ascend the sky,
	And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
	O Buckingham! take heed of yonder dog:
	Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites
	His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
	Have not to do with him, beware of him;
	Sin, death and hell have set their marks on him,
	And all their ministers attend on him.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
	What! dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel,
	And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
	O! but remember this another day,
	When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
	And say poor Margaret was a prophetess.
	Live each of you the subject to his hate,
	And he to yours, and all of you to God's!

	So, now prosperity begins to mellow
	And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
	Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd
	To watch the waning of mine enemies.
	A dire induction am I witness to,
	And will to France, hoping the consequence
	Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
	Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?

	If ancient sorrow be most reverend,
	Give mine the benefit of seniory,
	And let my griefs frown on the upper hand,
	If sorrow can admit society.
	Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:
	I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
	I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:
	Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
	Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard kill'd him.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 4><72%>
	Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.
	From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
	A hellhound that doth hunt us all to death:
	That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
	To worry lambs, and lap their gentle blood,
	That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
	That excellent grand-tyrant of the earth,
	That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
	Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.
	O! upright, just, and true-disposing God,
	How do I thank thee that this carnal cur
	Preys on the issue of his mother's body,
	And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 4><72%>
	Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
	And now I cloy me with beholding it.
	Thy Edward he is dead, that kill'd my Edward;
	Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
	Young York he is but boot, because both they
	Match not the high perfection of my loss:
	Thy Clarence he is dead that stabb'd my Edward;
	And the beholders of this tragic play,
	The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
	Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
	Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
	Only reserv'd their factor, to buy souls
	And send them thither; but at hand, at hand,
	Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:
	Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray,
	To have him suddenly convey'd from hence.
	Cancel his bond of life, dear God! I pray,
	That I may live to say, The dog is dead.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 4><73%>
	I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;
	I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;
	The presentation of but what I was;
	The flattering index of a direful pageant;
	One heav'd a-high to be hurl'd down below;
	A mother only mock'd with two fair babes;
	A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
	A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
	To be the aim of every dangerous shot;
	A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
	Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
	Where are thy children? wherein dost thou joy?
	Who sues and kneels and cries God save the queen?
	Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
	Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?
	Decline all this, and see what now thou art:
	For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
	For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
	For one being su'd to, one that humbly sues;
	For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;
	For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
	For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;
	For one commanding all, obey'd of none.
	Thus hath the course of justice whirl'd about,
	And left thee but a very prey to time;
	Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
	To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
	Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
	Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
	Now thy proud neck bears half my burden'd yoke;
	From which even here, I slip my wearied head,
	And leave the burden of it all on thee.
	Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:
	These English woes shall make me smile in France.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 4><74%>
	Forbear to sleep the night, and fast the day;
	Compare dead happiness with living woe;
	Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,
	And he that slew them fouler than he is:
	Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:
	Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 4><74%>
	Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.
