	Madam, his majesty doth call for you;

	He for his father's sake so loves the prince
	That he will not be won to aught against him.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	My good lords both, with all the heed I can.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	You shall, my lord.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	Many good morrows to my noble lord!
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;
	And I believe will never stand upright
	Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	Ay, my good lord.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	Ay, on my life; and hopes to find you forward
	Upon his party for the gain thereof:
	And thereupon he sends you this good news,
	That this same very day your enemies,
	The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
	When men are unprepar'd and look not for it.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	The princes both make high account of you;
	</STAGE DIR> For they account his head upon the bridge.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 7><58%>
	He doth entreat your Grace, my noble lord,
	To visit him to-morrow or next day.
	He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
	Divinely bent to meditation;
	And in no worldly suit would he be mov'd,
	To draw him from his holy exercise.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 7><58%>
	I'll signify so much unto him straight.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 7><59%>
	He wonders to what end you have assembled
	Such troops of citizens to come to him,
	His Grace not being warn'd thereof before:
	My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 7><61%>
	O! make them joyful: grant their lawful suit:
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 7><62%>
	Call them again, sweet prince; accept their suit:
	If you deny them, all the land will rue it.

	My lord!
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
	Bad news, my lord: Morton is fled to Richmond;
	And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
	Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 4><83%>
	Here, my good lord.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 4><83%>
	I will, my lord, with all convenient haste.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 4><83%>
	First, mighty liege, tell me your highness' pleasure,
	What from your Grace I shall deliver to him.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 4><83%>
	I go.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 4><85%>
	My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken,
	That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond
	Is with a mighty power landed at Milford
	Is colder news, but yet they must be told.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	It's supper-time, my lord;
	It's nine o'clock.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	It is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 4><98%>
	Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk! rescue, rescue!
	The king enacts more wonders than a man,
	Daring an opposite to every danger:
	His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
	Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
	Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 4><99%>
	Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse.
