	I am much bounden to your majesty.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 3><50%>
	So well, that what you bid me undertake,
	Though that my death were adjunct to my act,
	By heaven, I would do it.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 3><50%>
	And I'll keep him so
	That he shall not offend your majesty.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 3><50%>
	My lord?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 3><50%>
	He shall not live.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 1><58%>
	Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand
	Within the arras: when I strike my foot
	Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth,
	And bind the boy which you shall find with me
	Fast to the chair: be heedful. Hence, and watch.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 1><58%>
	Uncleanly scruples! fear not you: look to't.
	Young lad, come forth; I have to say with you.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 1><58%>
	Good morrow, little prince.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 1><58%>
	Indeed, I have been merrier.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
	</STAGE DIR> If I talk to him with his innocent prate
	He will awake my mercy which lies dead:
	Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
	</STAGE DIR> His words do take possession of my bosom.
	Read here, young Arthur.
	</STAGE DIR> How now, foolish rheum!
	Turning dispiteous torture out of door!
	I must be brief, lest resolution drop
	Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.
	Can you not read it? is it not fair writ?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
	Young boy, I must.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
	And I will.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
	I have sworn to do it;
	And with hot irons must I burn them out.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
	</STAGE DIR> Come forth.
	Do as I bid you do.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	Go, stand within: let me alone with him.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	Come, boy, prepare yourself.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	None, but to lose your eyes.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
	Is this your promise? go to, hold your tongue.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	I can heat it, boy.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	But with my breath I can revive it, boy.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eyes
	For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:
	Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,
	With this same very iron to burn them out.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	Peace! no more. Adieu.
	Your uncle must not know but you are dead;
	I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports:
	And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure,
	That Hubert for the wealth of all the world
	Will not offend thee.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	Silence! no more, go closely in with me:
	Much danger do I undergo for thee.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 2><70%>
	My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night:
	Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about
	The other four in wondrous motion.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 2><70%>
	Old men and beldams in the streets
	Do prophesy upon it dangerously:
	Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths;
	And when they talk of him, they shake their heads
	And whisper one another in the ear;
	And he that speaks, doth gripe the hearer's wrist
	Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,
	With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.
	I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,
	The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,
	With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;
	Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,
	Standing on slippers,—which his nimble haste
	Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,—
	Told of a many thousand warlike French,
	That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent.
	Another lean unwash'd artificer
	Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 2><71%>
	No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 2><71%>
	Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 2><72%>
	My lord,—
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 2><72%>
	Arm you against your other enemies,
	I'll make a peace between your soul and you.
	Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine
	Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,
	Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
	Within this bosom never enter'd yet
	The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;
	And you have slander'd nature in my form,
	Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,
	Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
	Than to be butcher of an innocent child.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
	Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you:
	Arthur doth live: the king hath sent for you.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
	I am no villain.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say:
	By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours.
	I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,
	Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;
	Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget
	Your worth, your greatness, and nobility.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	Not for my life; but yet I dare defend
	My innocent life against an emperor.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	Do not prove me so;
	Yet I am none. Whose tongue soe'er speaks false,
	Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	Lord Bigot, I am none.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	'Tis not an hour since I left him well:
	I honour'd him, I lov'd him; and will weep
	My date of life out for his sweet life's loss.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	Do but hear me, sir.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	Upon my soul,—
<SPEECH 41><ACT 4><SCENE 3><79%>
	If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,
	Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
	Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,
	Let hell want pains enough to torture me.
	I left him well.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	Badly, I fear. How fares your majesty?
<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 6><94%>
	Who's there? speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 6><94%>
	Of the part of England.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 6><94%>
	What's that to thee? Why may not I demand
	Of thine affairs as well as thou of mine?
<SPEECH 46><ACT 5><SCENE 6><94%>
	Thou hast a perfect thought:
	I will upon all hazards well believe
	Thou art my friend, that know'st my tongue so well.
	Who art thou?
<SPEECH 47><ACT 5><SCENE 6><94%>
	Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night
	Have done me shame: brave soldier, pardon me,
	That any accent breaking from thy tongue
	Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 6><94%>
	Why, here walk I in the black brow of night,
	To find you out.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 5><SCENE 6><94%>
	O! my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,
	Black, fearful, comfortless, and horrible.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 5><SCENE 6><95%>
	The king, I fear, is poison'd by a monk:
	I left him almost speechless; and broke out
	To acquaint you with this evil, that you might
	The better arm you to the sudden time
	Than if you had at leisure known of this.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 5><SCENE 6><95%>
	A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,
	Whose bowels suddenly burst out: the king
	Yet speaks, and peradventure may recover.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 5><SCENE 6><95%>
	Why, know you not? the lords are all come back,
	And brought Prince Henry in their company;
	At whose request the king hath pardon'd them,
	And they are all about his majesty.
