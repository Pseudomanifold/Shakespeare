	O! well did he become that lion's robe,

	My uncle's will in this respect is mine:
	If he see aught in you that makes him like,
	That anything he sees, which moves his liking,
	I can with ease translate it to my will;
	Or if you will, to speak more properly,
	I will enforce it easily to my love.
	Further I will not flatter you, my lord,
	That all I see in you is worthy love,
	Than this: that nothing do I see in you,
	Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,
	That I can find should merit any hate.

	Upon thy wedding-day?
	Against the blood that thou hast married?
	What! shall our feast be kept with slaughter'd men?
	Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,
	Clamours of hell, be measures to our pomp?
	O husband, hear me! ay, alack! how new
	Is husband in my mouth; even for that name,
	Which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce,
	Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms
	Against mine uncle.

	The sun's o'ercast with blood: fair day, adieu!
	Which is the side that I must go withal?
	I am with both: each army hath a hand;
	And in their rage, I having hold of both,
	They whirl asunder and dismember me.
	Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win;
	Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose;
	Father, I may not wish the fortune thine;
	Grandam, I will not wish thy wishes thrive:
	Whoever wins, on that side shall I lose;
	Assured loss before the match be play'd.
