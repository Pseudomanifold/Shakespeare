	Mine eye hath well examined his parts,

	What doth move you to claim your brother's land?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;
	Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,
	And if she did play false, the fault was hers;
	Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
	That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,
	Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,
	Had of your father claim'd this son for his?
	In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
	This calf bred from his cow from all the world;
	In sooth he might: then, if he were my brother's,
	My brother might not claim him; nor your father,
	Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;
	My mother's son did get your father's heir;
	Your father's heir must have your father's land.

	For our advantage; therefore hear us first.
	These flags of France, that are advanced here
	Before the eye and prospect of your town,
	Have hither march'd to your endamagement:
	The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,
	And ready mounted are they to spit forth
	Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls:
	All preparation for a bloody siege
	And merciless proceeding by these French
	Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates;
	And but for our approach those sleeping stones,
	That as a waist do girdle you about,
	By the compulsion of their ordinance
	By this time from their fixed beds of lime
	Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made
	For bloody power to rush upon your peace.
	But on the sight of us your lawful king,—
	Who painfully with much expedient march
	Have brought a countercheck before your gates,
	To save unscratch'd your city's threaten'd cheeks,—
	Behold, the French amaz'd vouchsafe a parle;
	And now, instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,
	To make a shaking fever in your walls,
	They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,
	To make a faithless error in your ears:
	Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,
	And let us in, your king, whose labour'd spirits,
	Forwearied in this action of swift speed,
	Crave harbourage within your city walls.

	But as we under heaven are supreme head,
	So under him that great supremacy,
	Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,

<SPEECH 51><ACT 3><SCENE 3><48%>
	Coz, farewell.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 3><SCENE 3><49%>
	Come hither, Hubert. O my gentle Hubert,
	We owe thee much: within this wall of flesh
	There is a soul counts thee her creditor,
	And with advantage means to pay thy love:
	And, my good friend, thy voluntary oath
	Lives in this bosom, dearly cherished.
	Give me thy hand. I had a thing to say,
	But I will fit it with some better time.
	By heaven, Hubert, I am almost asham'd
	To say what good respect I have of thee.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 3><SCENE 3><49%>
	Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet;
	But thou shalt have; and creep time ne'er so slow,
	Yet it shall come for me to do thee good.
	I had a thing to say, but let it go:
	The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,
	Attended with the pleasures of the world,
	Is all too wanton and too full of gawds
	To give me audience: if the midnight bell
	Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,
	Sound one into the drowsy race of night;
	If this same were a churchyard where we stand,
	And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs;
	Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,
	Had bak'd thy blood and made it heavy-thick,
	Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,
	Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes
	And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,
	A passion hateful to my purposes;
	Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
	Hear me without thine ears, and make reply
	Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
	Without eyes, ears, and harmful sound of words;
	Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,
	I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts:
	But ah! I will not: yet I love thee well;
	And, by my troth, I think thou lov'st me well.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 3><SCENE 3><50%>
	Do not I know thou wouldst?
	Good Hubert! Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye
	On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what, my friend,
	He is a very serpent in my way;
	And wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread
	He lies before me: dost thou understand me?
	Thou art his keeper.

<SPEECH 58><ACT 3><SCENE 3><50%>

	We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:
	Good lords, although my will to give is living,

	There is no sure foundation set on blood,
	No certain life achiev'd by others' death.
	A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood

	So foul a sky clears not without a storm:
	Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?
<SPEECH 65><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	O! where hath our intelligence been drunk?
	Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care

	Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!

	That thou for truth giv'st out are landed here?

	Thou hast made me giddy

	Bear with me, cousin, for I was amaz'd

	Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?

	Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arriv'd?

	Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.
	O! let me have no subject enemies

	And fly like thought from them to me again.

<SPEECH 77><ACT 4><SCENE 2><71%>
	It is the curse of kings to be attended

	O! when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth

	A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
	Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,
	This murder had not come into my mind;
	But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,
	Finding thee fit for bloody villany,
	Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,
	I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;
	And thou, to be endeared to a king,
	Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.
<SPEECH 79><ACT 4><SCENE 2><72%>
	Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
	When I spake darkly what I purposed,
	Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,
	As bid me tell my tale in express words,
	Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,
	And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:
	But thou didst understand me by my signs
	And didst in signs again parley with sin;
	Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,
	And consequently thy rude hand to act
	The deed which both our tongues held vile to name.
	Out of my sight, and never see me more!
	My nobles leave me; and my state is brav'd,
	Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:
	Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
	This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
	Hostility and civil tumult reigns
	Between my conscience and my cousin's death.
<SPEECH 80><ACT 4><SCENE 2><73%>
	Doth Arthur live? O! haste thee to the peers,
	Throw this report on their incensed rage,
	And make them tame to their obedience.
	Forgive the comment that my passion made
	Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
	And foul imaginary eyes of blood
	Presented thee more hideous than thou art.
	O! answer not; but to my closet bring
	The angry lords, with all expedient haste.
	I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.
<SPEECH 81><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
	Thus have I yielded up into your hand

	Swearing allegiance and the love of soul
	To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
	This inundation of mistemper'd humour
	Rests by you only to be qualified:
	Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,
	That present medicine must be minister'd,

	My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,
	Which holds but till thy news be uttered;
	And then all this thou seest is but a clod
	And module of confounded royalty.
