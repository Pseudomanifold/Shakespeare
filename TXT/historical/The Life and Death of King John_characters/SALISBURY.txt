	What other harm have I, good lady, done,
	But spoke the harm that is by others done?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 1><36%>
	Pardon me, madam,
	I may not go without you to the kings.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
	Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,
	To guard a title that was rich before,
	To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,
	To throw a perfume on the violet,
	To smooth the ice, or add another hue
	Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light
	To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,
	Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
	In this the antique and well-noted face
	Of plain old form is much disfigured;
	And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,
	It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,
	Startles and frights consideration,
	Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,
	For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
	To this effect, before you were newcrown'd,
	We breath'd our counsel: but it pleas'd your highness
	To overbear it, and we are all well pleas'd;
	Since all and every part of what we would
	Doth make a stand at what your highness will.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	The colour of the king doth come and go
	Between his purpose and his conscience,
	Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:
	His passion is so ripe it needs must break.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	It is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame
	That greatness should so grossly offer it:
	So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 3><74%>
	Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury.
	It is our safety, and we must embrace
	This gentle offer of the perilous time.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 3><74%>
	The Count Melun, a noble lord of France;
	Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love,
	Is much more general than these lines import.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 3><74%>
	Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be
	Two long days' journey, lords, or e'er we meet.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 3><74%>
	The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:
	We will not line his thin bestained cloak
	With our pure honours, nor attend the foot
	That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.
	Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	This is the prison.
	What is he lies here?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
	Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	Sir Richard, what think you? Have you beheld,
	Or have you read, or heard? or could you think?
	Or do you almost think, although you see,
	That you do see? could thought, without this object,
	Form such another? This is the very top,
	The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,
	Of murder's arms: this is the bloodiest shame,
	The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,
	That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage
	Presented to the tears of soft remorse.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
	If that it be the work of any hand!
	We had a kind of light what would ensue:
	It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;
	The practice and the purpose of the king:
	From whose obedience I forbid my soul,
	Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,
	And breathing to his breathless excellence
	The incense of a vow, a holy vow,
	Never to taste the pleasures of the world,
	Never to be infected with delight,
	Nor conversant with ease and idleness,
	Till I have set a glory to this hand,
	By giving it the worship of revenge.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
	O! he is bold and blushes not at death.
	Avaunt, thou hateful villain! get thee gone.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
	</STAGE DIR> Must I rob the law?
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	Thou art a murderer.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,
	For villany is not without such rheum;
	And he, long traded in it, makes it seem
	Like rivers of remorse and innocency.
	Away with me, all you whose souls abhor
	The uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;
	For I am stifled with this smell of sin.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 2><83%>
	Upon our sides it never shall be broken.
	And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear
	A voluntary zeal, an unurg'd faith
	To your proceedings; yet, believe me, prince,
	I am not glad that such a sore of time
	Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,
	And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
	By making many. O! it grieves my soul
	That I must draw this metal from my side
	To be a widow-maker! O! and there
	Where honourable rescue and defence
	Cries out upon the name of Salisbury.
	But such is the infection of the time,
	That, for the health and physic of our right,
	We cannot deal but with the very hand
	Of stern injustice and confused wrong.
	And is't not pity, O my grieved friends!
	That we, the sons and children of this isle,
	Were born to see so sad an hour as this;
	Wherein we step after a stranger march
	Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up
	Her enemies' ranks,—I must withdraw and weep
	Upon the spot of this enforced cause,—
	To grace the gentry of a land remote,
	And follow unacquainted colours here?
	What, here? O nation! that thou couldst remove;
	That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,
	Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,
	And gripple thee unto a pagan shore;
	Where these two Christian armies might combine
	The blood of malice in a vein of league,
	And not to spend it so unneighbourly!
<SPEECH 26><ACT 5><SCENE 4><90%>
	I did not think the king so stor'd with friends.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 4><90%>
	That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,
	In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 4><91%>
	When we were happy we had other names.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 4><91%>
	Wounded to death.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 4><91%>
	May this be possible? may this be true?
<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 4><92%>
	We do believe thee: and beshrew my soul
	But I do love the favour and the form
	Of this most fair occasion, by the which
	We will untread the steps of damned flight,
	And like a bated and retired flood,
	Leaving our rankness and irregular course,
	Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd,
	And calmly run on in obedience,
	Even to our ocean, to our great King John.
	My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence,
	For I do see the cruel pangs of death
	Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
	And happy newness, that intends old right.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 5><SCENE 7><96%>
	Be of good comfort, prince; for you are born
	To set a form upon that indigest
	Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 5><SCENE 7><98%>
	You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.
	My liege! my lord! But now a king, now thus.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 7><99%>
	It seems you know not then so much as we.
	The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,
	Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,
	And brings from him such offers of our peace
	As we with honour and respect may take,
	With purpose presently to leave this war.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 7><99%>
	Nay, it is in a manner done already;
	For many carriages he hath dispatch'd
	To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel
	To the disposing of the cardinal:
	With whom yourself, myself, and other lords,
	If you think meet, this afternoon will post
	To consummate this business happily.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 5><SCENE 7><99%>
	And the like tender of our love we make,
	To rest without a spot for evermore.
