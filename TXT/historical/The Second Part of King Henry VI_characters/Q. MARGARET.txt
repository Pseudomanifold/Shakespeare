	Great King of England and my gracious lord,
	The mutual conference that my mind hath had
	By day, by night, waking, and in my dreams,
	In courtly company, or at my beads,
	With you, mine alderliefest sovereign,
	Makes me the bolder to salute my king
	With ruder terms, such as my wit affords,
	And over-joy of heart doth minister.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	We thank you all.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
	</STAGE DIR> To my Lord Protector! are your supplications to his lordship? Let me see them: what is thine?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
	What sayst thou? Did the Duke of York say he was rightful heir to the crown?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 3><13%>
	And as for you, that love to be protected
	Under the wings of our protector's grace,
	Begin your suits anew and sue to him.
	Away, base cullions! Suffolk, let them go.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><13%>
	My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,
	Is this the fashion of the court of England?
	Is this the government of Britain's isle,
	And this the royalty of Albion's king?
	What! shall King Henry be a pupil still
	Under the surly Gloucester's governance?
	Am I a queen in title and in style,
	And must be made a subject to a duke?
	I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
	Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love,
	And stol'st away the ladies' hearts of France,
	I thought King Henry had resembled thee
	In courage, courtship, and proportion:
	But all his mind is bent to holiness,
	To number Ave-Maries on his beads;
	His champions are the prophets and apostles;
	His weapons holy saws of sacred writ;
	His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves
	Are brazen images of canoniz'd saints.
	I would the college of the cardinals
	Would choose him pope, and carry him to Rome,
	And set the triple crown upon his head:
	That were a state fit for his holiness.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><13%>
	Beside the haught protector, have we Beaufort
	The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,
	And grumbling York; and not the least of these
	But can do more in England than the king.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	Not all these lords do vex me half so much
	As that proud dame, the Lord Protector's wife:
	She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,
	More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife.
	Strangers in court do take her for the queen:
	She bears a duke's revenues on her back,
	And in her heart she scorns our poverty.
	Shall I not live to be aveng'd on her?
	Contemptuous base-born callot as she is,
	She vaunted 'mongst her minions t'other day
	The very train of her worst wearing gown
	Was better worth than all my father's lands,
	Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	Because the king, forsooth, will have it so.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	If he be old enough, what needs your Grace
	To be protector of his excellence?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	Thy sale of offices and towns in France,
	If they were known, as the suspect is great,
	Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.
	Give me my fan: what, minion! can ye not?
	I cry you mercy, madam, was it you?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
	Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook,
	I saw not better sport these seven years' day:
	Yet, by your leave, the wind was very high,
	And, ten to one, old Joan had not gone out.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	And thy ambition, Gloucester.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Tell me, good fellow, cam'st thou here by chance,
	Or of devotion, to this holy shrine?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	It made me laugh to see the villain run.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
	Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest;
	And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
	I see no reason why a king of years
	Should be to be protected like a child.
	God and King Henry govern England's helm!
	Give up your staff, sir, and the king his realm.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
	Why, now is Henry king, and Margaret queen;
	And Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, scarce himself,
	That bears so shrewd a maim: two pulls at once;
	His lady banish'd, and a limb lopp'd off;
	This staff of honour raught: there let it stand,
	Where it best fits to be, in Henry's hand.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
	Ay, good my lord; for purposely therefore
	Left I the court, to see this quarrel tried.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 1><38%>
	Can you not see? or will ye not observe
	The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?
	With what a majesty he bears himself,
	How insolent of late he is become,
	How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?
	We know the time since he was mild and affable,
	An if we did but glance a far-off look,
	Immediately he was upon his knee,
	That all the court admir'd him for submission:
	But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,
	When everyone will give the time of day,
	He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,
	And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,
	Disdaining duty that to us belongs.
	Small curs are not regarded when they grin,
	But great men tremble when the lion roars;
	And Humphrey is no little man in England.
	First note that he is near you in descent,
	And should you fall, he is the next will mount.
	Me seemeth then it is no policy,
	Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears,
	And his advantage following your decease,
	That he should come about your royal person
	Or be admitted to your highness' council.
	By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts,
	And when he please to make commotion,
	'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.
	Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;
	Suffer them now and they'll o'ergrow the garden,
	And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.
	The reverent care I bear unto my lord
	Made me collect these dangers in the duke.
	If it be fond, call it a woman's fear;
	Which fear if better reasons can supplant,
	I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke.
	My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,
	Reprove my allegation if you can
	Or else conclude my words effectual.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 1><40%>
	Ah! what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!
	Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrow'd,
	For he's disposed as the hateful raven:
	Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,
	For he's inclin'd as is the ravenous wolf.
	Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?
	Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all
	Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	But I can give the loser leave to chide.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	What! will your highness leave the parliament?
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Fair lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams.
	Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,
	Too full of foolish pity; and Gloucester's show
	Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile
	With sorrow snares relenting passengers;
	Or as the snake, roll'd in a flow'ring bank,
	With shining checker'd slough, doth sting a child
	That for the beauty thinks it excellent.
	Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I,—
	And yet herein I judge mine own wit good,—
	This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,
	To rid us from the fear we have of him.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	So the poor chicken should be sure of death.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	Thrice noble Suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	And so say I.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Nay then, this spark will prove a raging fire,
	If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with.
	No more, good York; sweet Somerset, be still:
	Thy fortune, York, hadst thou been regent there,
	Might happily have prov'd far worse than his.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	God forbid any malice should prevail
	That faultless may condemn a nobleman!
	Pray God, he may acquit him of suspicion!
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	Marry, God forfend!
<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	How fares my lord? Help, lords! the king is dead.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes!
<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	How fares my gracious lord?
<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?
	Although the duke was enemy to him,
	Yet he, most Christian-like, laments his death:
	And for myself, foe as he was to me,
	Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans
	Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,
	I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,
	Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,
	And all to have the noble duke alive.
	What know I how the world may deem of me?
	For it is known we were but hollow friends:
	It may be judg'd I made the duke away:
	So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded,
	And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.
	This get I by his death. Ay me, unhappy!
	To be a queen, and crown'd with infamy!
<SPEECH 35><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
	Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.
	What! dost thou turn away and hide thy face?
	I am no loathsome leper; look on me.
	What! art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf?
	Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen.
	Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?
	Why, then, Dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy:
	Erect his statua and worship it,
	And make my image but an alehouse sign.
	Was I for this nigh wrack'd upon the sea,
	And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
	Drove back again unto my native clime?
	What boded this, but well forewarning wind
	Did seem to say, 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,
	Nor set no footing on this unkind shore?'
	What did I then, but curs'd the gentle gusts
	And he that loos'd them forth their brazen caves;
	And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,
	Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock?
	Yet Æolus would not be a murderer,
	But left that hateful office unto thee:
	The pretty vaulting sea refus'd to drown me,
	Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore
	With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness:
	The splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands,
	And would not dash me with their ragged sides,
	Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,
	Might in thy palace perish Margaret.
	As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
	When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,
	I stood upon the hatches in the storm,
	And when the dusky sky began to rob
	My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,
	I took a costly jewel from my neck,
	A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,
	And threw it towards thy land: the sea receiv'd it,
	And so I wish'd thy body might my heart:
	And even with this I lost fair England's view,
	And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,
	And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles
	For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.
	How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue—
	The agent of thy foul inconstancy—
	To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did
	When he to madding Dido would unfold
	His father's acts, commenc'd in burning Troy!
	Am I not witch'd like her? or thou not false like him?
	Ay me! I can no more. Die, Margaret!
	For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	Then you, belike, suspect these noblemen
	As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	Are you the butcher, Suffolk? where's your knife?
	Is Beaufort term'd a kite? where are his talons?
<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
	He dares not calm his contumelious spirit,
	Nor cease to be an arrogant controller,
	Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	What noise is this?
<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	O Henry! let me plead for gentle Suffolk.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
	Mischance and sorrow go along with you!
	Heart's discontent and sour affliction
	Be playfellows to keep you company!
	There's two of you; the devil make a third,
	And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!
<SPEECH 42><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
	Fie, coward woman and soft-hearted wretch!
	Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy?
<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 2><60%>
	Enough, sweet Suffolk; thou torment'st thyself;
	And these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glass,
	Or like an over-charged gun, recoil,
	And turn the force of them upon thyself.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 2><60%>
	O! let me entreat thee, cease! Give me thy hand,
	That I may dew it with my mournful tears;
	Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place,
	To wash away my woeful monuments.
	O! could this kiss be printed in thy hand,
	That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,
	Through whom a thousand sighs are breath'd for thee.
	So, get thee gone, that I may know my grief;
	'Tis but surmis'd whiles thou art standing by,
	As one that surfeits thinking on a want.
	I will repeal thee, or, be well assur'd,
	Adventure to be banished myself;
	And banished I am, if but from thee.
	Go; speak not to me; even now be gone.
	O! go not yet. Even thus two friends condemn'd
	Embrace and kiss, and take ten thousand leaves,
	Loather a hundred times to part than die.
	Yet now farewell; and farewell life with thee!
<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 2><61%>
	Whither goes Vaux so fast? what news, I prithee?
<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 2><61%>
	Go tell this heavy message to the king.
	Ay me! what is this world! what news are these!
	But wherefore grieve I at an hour's poor loss,
	Omitting Suffolk's exile, my soul's treasure?
	Why only, Suffolk, mourn I not for thee,
	And with the southern clouds contend in tears,
	Theirs for the earth's increase, mine for my sorrows?
	Now get thee hence: the king, thou know'st, is coming;
	If thou be found by me thou art but dead.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 3><SCENE 2><62%>
	Away! though parting be a fretful corsive,
	It is applied to a deathful wound.
	To France, sweet Suffolk: let me hear from thee;
	For wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe,
	I'll have an Iris that shall find thee out.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 3><SCENE 2><62%>
	And take my heart with thee.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 3><SCENE 2><62%>
	This way for me.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind,
	And makes it fearful and degenerate;
	Think therefore on revenge, and cease to weep.
	But who can cease to weep and look on this?
	Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast;
	But where's the body that I should embrace?
<SPEECH 51><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	Ah, barbarous villains! hath this lovely face
	Rul'd like a wandering planet over me,
	And could it not enforce them to relent,
	That were unworthy to behold the same?
<SPEECH 52><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	No, my love; I should not mourn, but die for thee.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
	Ah! were the Duke of Suffolk now alive,
	These Kentish rebels would be soon appeas'd.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
	My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceas'd.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,
	But boldly stand and front him to his face.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
	Call hither Clifford; bid him come amain,
	To say if that the bastard boys of York
	Shall be the surety for their traitor father.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	And here comes Clifford, to deny their bail.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	He is arrested, but will not obey:
	His sons, he says, shall give their words for him.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 5><SCENE 1><95%>
	A subtle traitor needs no sophister.
<SPEECH 60><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
	Away, my lord! you are slow: for shame, away!
<SPEECH 61><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
	What are you made of? you'll nor fight nor fly:
	Now is it manhood, wisdom, and defence,
	To give the enemy way, and to secure us
	By what we can, which can no more but fly.
	If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom
	Of all our fortunes: but if we haply scape,
	As well we may, if not through your neglect,
	We shall to London get, where you are lov'd,
	And where this breach now in our fortunes made
	May readily be stopp'd.
