	Why should he then protect our sovereign,
	He being of age to govern of himself?
	Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,
	And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,
	We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Or thou, or I, Somerset, will be protector,
	Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	All in this presence are thy betters, Warwick.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	Thy cruelty in execution
	Upon offenders hath exceeded law,
	And left thee to the mercy of the law.

	Lord Cardinal, I will follow Eleanor,
	And listen after Humphrey, how he proceeds:
	She's tickled now; her fume can need no spurs,
	She'll gallop far enough to her destruction.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 4><20%>
	True, madam, none at all. What call you this?
	Away with them! let them be clapp'd up close
	And kept asunder. You, madam, shall with us:
	Stafford, take her to thee.—
	We'll see your trinkets here all forthcoming.
	All, away!
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 4><21%>
	Your Grace shall give me leave, my Lord of York,
	To be the post, in hope of his reward.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold.
	A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,
	Under the countenance and confederacy
	Of Lady Eleanor, the protector's wife,
	The ringleader and head of all this rout,
	Have practis'd dangerously against your state,
	Dealing with witches and with conjurers:
	Whom we have apprehended in the fact;
	Raising up wicked spirits from under-ground,
	Demanding of King Henry's life and death,
	And other of your highness' privy council,
	As more at large your Grace shall understand.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 1><40%>
	Tut! these are petty faults to faults unknown,
	Which time will bring to light in smooth Duke Humphrey.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	He'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day.
	Lord Cardinal, he is your prisoner.

	What answer makes your Grace to the rebels' supplication?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
	My gracious lord, retire to Killingworth,
	Until a power be rais'd to put them down.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
	Then linger not, my lord; away! take horse.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 4><77%>
	Trust nobody, for fear you be betray'd.

	Ay, here they be that dare and will disturb thee.
	Know, Cade, we come ambassadors from the king
	Unto the commons whom thou hast misled;
	And here pronounce free pardon to them all
	That will forsake thee and go home in peace.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 8><84%>
	What, is he fled? go some, and follow him;
	And he that brings his head unto the king
	Shall have a thousand crowns for his reward.
	Follow me, soldiers: we'll devise a mean
	To reconcile you all unto the king.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 1><85%>
	Health, and glad tidings, to your majesty!
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 1><86%>
	I will, my lord; and doubt not so to deal
	As all things shall redound unto your good.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	York, if thou meanest well, I greet thee well.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	A messenger from Henry, our dread hege,
	To know the reason of these arms in peace;
	Or why thou,—being a subject as I am,—
	Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,
	Shouldst raise so great a power without his leave,
	Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	That is too much presumption on thy part:
	But if thy arms be to no other end,
	The king hath yielded unto thy demand:
	The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	Upon mine honour, he is a prisoner.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	York, I commend this kind submission:
	We twain will go into his highness' tent.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
	So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss
	He were created knight for his good service.
