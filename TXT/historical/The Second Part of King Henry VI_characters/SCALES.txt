	How now! is Jack Cade slain?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 5><77%>
	Such aid as I can spare you shall command;
	But I am troubled here with them myself;
	The rebels have assay'd to win the Tower.
	But get you to Smithfield and gather head,
	And thither I will send you Matthew Goffe:
	Fight for your king, your country, and your lives;
	And so, farewell, for I must hence again.
