	Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret:
	I can express no kinder sign of love
	Than this kind kiss. O Lord! that lends me life,
	Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!
	For thou hast given me in this beauteous face
	A world of earthly blessings to my soul,
	If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	Her sight did ravish, but her grace in speech,
	Her words y-clad with wisdom's majesty,
	Makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys;
	Such is the fulness of my heart's content.
	Lords, with one cheerful voice welcome my love.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Uncle, how now!
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	They please us well. Lord marquess, kneel down:
	We here create thee the first Duke of Suffolk,
	And girt thee with the sword. Cousin of York,
	We here discharge your Grace from being regent
	I' the parts of France, till term of eighteen months
	Be full expir'd. Thanks, uncle Winchester,
	Gloucester, York, Buckingham, Somerset,
	Salisbury, and Warwick;
	We thank you all for this great favour done,
	In entertainment to my princely queen.
	Come, let us in, and with all speed provide
	To see her coronation be perform'd.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	For my part, noble lords, I care not which;
	Or Somerset or York, all's one to me.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	Sweet aunt, be quiet; 'twas against her will.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	What mean'st thou, Suffolk? tell me, what are these?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	Say, man, were these thy words?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	Then be it so. My Lord of Somerset,
	We make your Grace lord regent o'er the French.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	Away with them to prison; and the day
	Of combat shall be the last of the next month.
	Come, Somerset, we'll see thee sent away.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,
	And what a pitch she flew above the rest!
	To see how God in all his creatures works!
	Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	The treasury of everlasting joy.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	I prithee, peace,

<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Why, how now, uncle Gloucester!
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	The winds grow high; so do your stomachs, lords.
	How irksome is this music to my heart!
	When such strings jar, what hope of harmony?
	I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Now, God be prais'd, that to believing souls

	Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance,

	What! hast thou been long blind, and now restor'd?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Where wert thou born?
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Poor soul! God's goodness hath been great to thee:

	Why then, thou know'st what colour jet is of?

<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
	O God! what mischiefs work the wicked ones,

<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
	Well, for this night we will repose us here:
	To-morrow toward London back again,
	To look into this business thoroughly,
	And call these foul offenders to their answers;
	And poise the cause in justice' equal scales,
	Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause prevails.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
	Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester's wife.
	In sight of God and us, your guilt is great:
	Receive the sentence of the law for sins
	Such as by God's book are adjudg'd to death.
	You four, from hence to prison back again;
	From thence, unto the place of execution:
	The witch in Smithfield shall be burn'd to ashes,
	And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.
	You, madam, for you are more nobly born,
	Despoiled of your honour in your life,
	Shall, after three days' open penance done,
	Live in your country here, in banishment,
	With Sir John Stanley, in the Isle of Man.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
	Stay, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester: ere thou go,
	Give up thy staff: Henry will to himself
	Protector be; and God shall be my hope,
	My stay, my guide, and lantern to my feet.
	And go in peace, Humphrey; no less belov'd
	Than when thou wert protector to thy king.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
	O' God's name, see the lists and all things fit:
	Here let them end it; and God defend the right!
<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
	Go, take hence that traitor from our sight;
	For by his death we do perceive his guilt:
	And God in justice hath reveal'd to us
	The truth and innocence of this poor fellow,
	Which he had thought to have murder'd wrongfully.
	Come, fellow, follow us for thy reward.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 1><38%>
	I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come:
	'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,
	Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 1><40%>
	My lords, at once: the care you have of us,
	To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,
	Is worthy praise; but shall I speak my conscience,
	Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent
	From meaning treason to our royal person,
	As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove.
	The duke is virtuous, mild, and too well given
	To dream on evil, or to work my downfall.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 3><SCENE 1><40%>
	Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?
<SPEECH 36><ACT 3><SCENE 1><40%>
	Cold news, Lord Somerset: but God's will be done!
<SPEECH 37><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
	My Lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope
	That you will clear yourself from all suspect:
	My conscience tells me you are innocent.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best
	Do or undo, as if ourself were here.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	Ay, Margaret; my heart is drown'd with grief,
	Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes,
	My body round engirt with misery,
	For what's more miserable than discontent?
	Ah! uncle Humphrey, in thy face I see
	The map of honour, truth, and loyalty;
	And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come
	That e'er I prov'd thee false, or fear'd thy faith.
	What low'ring star now envies thy estate,
	That these great lords, and Margaret our queen,
	Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?
	Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;
	And as the butcher takes away the calf,
	And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,
	Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,
	Even so, remorseless, have they borne him hence;
	And as the dam runs lowing up and down,
	Looking the way her harmless young one went,
	And can do nought but wail her darling's loss;
	Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case,
	With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyes
	Look after him, and cannot do him good;
	So mighty are his vowed enemies.
	His fortunes I will weep; and, 'twixt each groan,
	Say 'Who's a traitor, Gloucester he is none.'
<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	Go, call our uncle to our presence straight;
	Say, we intend to try his Grace to-day,
	If he be guilty, as 'tis published.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	Lords, take your places; and, I pray you all,
	Proceed no straiter 'gainst our uncle Gloucester
	Than from true evidence, of good esteem,
	He be approv'd in practice culpable.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	I thank thee, Meg; these words content me much.
	How now! why look'st thou pale? why tremblest thou?
	Where is our uncle? what's the matter, Suffolk?
<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	O heavenly God!
<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	What! doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?
	Came he right now to sing a raven's note,
	Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers,
	And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,
	By crying comfort from a hollow breast,
	Can chase away the first-conceived sound?
	Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words:
	Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say:
	Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.
	Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!
	Upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny
	Sits in grim majesty to fright the world.
	Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding:
	Yet do not go away; come, basilisk,
	And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;
	For in the shade of death I shall find joy,
	In life but double death, now Gloucester's dead.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
	Ah! woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true;
	But how he died God knows, not Henry.
	Enter his chamber, view his breathless corpse,
	And comment then upon his sudden death.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	O! Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts,
	My thoughts that labour to persuade my soul
	Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life.
	If my suspect be false, forgive me, God,
	For judgment only doth belong to thee.
	Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
	With twenty thousand kisses, and to drain
	Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,
	To tell my love unto his deaf dumb trunk,
	And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling:
	But all in vain are these mean obsequies,
	And to survey his dead and earthly image
	What were it but to make my sorrow greater?
<SPEECH 48><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	That is to see how deep my grave is made;
	For with his soul fled all my worldly solace,
	For seeing him I see my life in death.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted!
	Thrice is he arm'd that hath his quarrel just,
	And he but naked, though lock'd up in steel,
	Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	Why, how now, lords! your wrathful weapons drawn
	Here in our presence! dare you be so bold?
	Why, what tumultuous clamour have we here?
<SPEECH 51><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	Go, Salisbury, and tell them all from me,
	I thank them for their tender loving care;
	And had I not been cited so by them,
	Yet did I purpose as they do entreat;
	For, sure, my thoughts do hourly prophesy
	Mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means:
	And therefore, by his majesty I swear,
	Whose far unworthy deputy I am,
	He shall not breathe infection in this air
	But three days longer, on the pain of death.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	Ungentle queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!
	No more, I say; if thou dost plead for him
	Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.
	Had I but said, I would have kept my word,
	But when I swear, it is irrevocable.
	</STAGE DIR> If after three days' space thou here be'st found
	On any ground that I am ruler of,
	The world shall not be ransom for thy life.
	Come, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me;
	I have great matters to impart to thee.

	Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch;

	Peace to his soul, if God's good pleasure be!

	He dies, and makes no sign. O God, forgive him!
<SPEECH 57><ACT 3><SCENE 3><63%>
	Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all.

	I'll send some holy bishop to entreat;
	For God forbid so many simple souls

	But stay, I'll read it over once again.

	Was ever king that joy'd an earthly throne,

	No sooner was I crept out of my cradle

	As I do long and wish to be a subject.
<SPEECH 67><ACT 4><SCENE 1><85%>
	Why, Buckingham, is the traitor Cade surpris'd?
	Or is he but retir'd to make him strong?
<SPEECH 68><ACT 4><SCENE 1><85%>
	Then, heaven, set ope thy everlasting gates,
	To entertain my vows of thanks and praise!
	Soldiers, this day have you redeem'd your lives,
	And show'd how well you love your prince and country:
	Continue still in this so good a mind,
	And Henry, though he be infortunate,
	Assure yourselves, will never be unkind:
	And so, with thanks and pardon to you all,
	I do dismiss you to your several countries.
<SPEECH 69><ACT 4><SCENE 1><85%>
	Thus stands my state, 'twixt Cade and York distress'd;
	Like to a ship, that, having scap'd a tempest,
	Is straight way calm'd, and boarded with a pirate.
	But now is Cade driven back, his men dispers'd;
	And now is York in arms to second him.
	I pray thee, Buckingham, go and meet him,
	And ask him what's the reason of these arms.
	Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower;
	And, Somerset, we will commit thee thither,
	Until his army be dismiss'd from him.
<SPEECH 70><ACT 4><SCENE 1><86%>

	Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?
	Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,

	O! where is faith? O, where is loyalty?
	If it be banish'd from the frosty head,
	Where shall it find a harbour in the earth?
	Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,
	And shame thine honourable age with blood?
	Why art thou old, and want'st experience?
	Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it?
