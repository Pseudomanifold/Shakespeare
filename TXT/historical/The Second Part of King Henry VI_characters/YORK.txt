	For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate,
	That dims the honour of this war-like isle!
	France should have torn and rent my very heart
	Before I would have yielded to this league.
	I never read but England's kings have had
	Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives;
	And our King Henry gives away his own,
	To match with her that brings no vantages.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	</STAGE DIR> And so says York, for he hath greatest cause.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	Anjou and Maine are given to the French;
	Paris is lost; the state of Normandy
	Stands on a tickle point now they are gone.
	Suffolk concluded on the articles,
	The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleas'd
	To change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.
	I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?
	'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.
	Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage,
	And purchase friends, and give to courtezans,
	Still revelling like lords till all be gone;
	While as the silly owner of the goods
	Weeps over them, and wrings his hapless hands,
	And shakes his head, and trembling stands aloof,
	While all is shar'd and all is borne away,
	Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:
	So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue
	While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.
	Methinks the realms of England, France, and Ireland
	Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
	As did the fatal brand Althæa burn'd
	Unto the prince's heart of Calydon.
	Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!
	Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,
	Even as I have of fertile England's soil.
	A day will come when York shall claim his own;
	And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts
	And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,
	And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,
	For that's the golden mark I seek to hit.
	Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right.
	Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
	Nor wear the diadem upon his head,
	Whose church-like humours fit not for a crown.
	Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:
	Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,
	To pry into the secrets of the state;
	Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,
	With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,
	And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:
	Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,
	With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfum'd,
	And in my standard bear the arms of York,
	To grapple with the house of Lancaster;
	And, force perforce, I'll make him yield the crown,
	Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	If York have ill demean'd himself in France,
	Then let him be denay'd the regentship.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	I'll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:
	First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride;
	Next, if I be appointed for the place,
	My Lord of Somerset will keep me here,
	Without discharge, money, or furniture,
	Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands.
	Last time I danc'd attendance on his will
	Till Paris was besieg'd, famish'd, and lost.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	Doth any one accuse York for a traitor?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	Base dunghill villain, and mechanical,

	Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash.
	Beldam, I think we watch'd you at an inch.
	What! madam, are you there? the king and commonweal
	Are deeply indebted for this piece of pains:
	My Lord Protector will, I doubt it not,
	See you well guerdon'd for these good deserts.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 4><21%>
	Lord Buckingham, methinks you watch'd her well:
	A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!
	Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
	What have we here?
	The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
	But him outlive, and die a violent death.
	Why, this is just,
	Aio te, Æacida, Romanos vincere posse.
	Well, to the rest:
	Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?
	By water shall he die and take his end.
	What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?
	Let him shun castles:
	Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
	Than where castles mounted stand.
	Come, come, my lords; these oracles
	Are hardly attain'd, and hardly understood.
	The king is now in progress towards Saint Alban's;
	With him, the husband of this lovely lady:
	Thither go these news as fast as horse can carry them,
	A sorry breakfast for my Lord Protector.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 4><21%>
	At your pleasure, my good lord. Who's within there, ho!
	Invite my Lords of Salisbury and Warwick
	To sup with me to-morrow night. Away!
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,
	Our simple supper ended, give me leave,
	In this close walk to satisfy myself,
	In craving your opinion of my title,
	Which is infallible to England's crown.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	Then thus:
	Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
	The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;
	The second, William of Hatfield; and the third,
	Lionel, Duke of Clarence; next to whom
	Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;
	The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;
	The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;
	William of Windsor was the seventh and last.
	Edward the Black Prince died before his father,
	And left behind him Richard, his only son,
	Who after Edward the Third's death, reign'd as king;
	Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,
	The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,
	Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,
	Seiz'd on the realm, depos'd the rightful king,
	Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,
	And him to Pomfret; where as all you know,
	Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	Which now they hold by force and not by right;
	For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,
	The issue of the next son should have reign'd.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line
	I claim the crown, had issue, Philippe a daughter,
	Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:
	Edmund had issue Roger, Earl of March:
	Roger had issue Edmund, Anne, and Eleanor.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	His eldest sister, Anne,
	My mother, being heir unto the crown,
	Married Richard, Earl of Cambridge, who was son
	To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son.
	By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir
	To Roger, Earl of March; who was the son
	Of Edmund Mortimer; who married Philippe,
	Sole daughter unto Lionel, Duke of Clarence:
	So, if the issue of the eldest son
	Succeed before the younger, I am king.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	We thank you, lords! But I am not your king
	Till I be crown'd, and that my sword be stain'd
	With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;
	And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,
	But with advice and silent secrecy.
	Do you as I do in these dangerous days,
	Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,
	At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,
	At Buckingham and all the crew of them,
	Till they have snar'd the shepherd of the flock,
	That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:
	'Tis that they seek; and they, in seeking that
	Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	And, Nevil, this I do assure myself,
	Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick
	The greatest man in England but the king.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
	Lords, let him go. Please it your majesty
	This is the day appointed for the combat;
	And ready are the appellant and defendant,

	So please your highness to behold the fight.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
	I never saw a fellow worse bested,
	Or more afraid to fight, than is the appellant,

	And did he not, in his protectorship,
	Levy great sums of money through the realm
	For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?
	By means whereof the towns each day revolted.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 1><40%>
	</STAGE DIR> Cold news for me; for I had hope of France,
	As firmly as I hope for fertile England.
	Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud,
	And caterpillars eat my leaves away;
	But I will remedy this gear ere long,
	Or sell my title for a glorious grave.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France,
	And, being protector, stay'd the soldiers' pay;
	By means whereof his highness hath lost France.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>

	So that, by this, you would not have him die.

	To guard the chicken from a hungry kite,
	As place Duke Humphrey for the king's protector?

<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done:
	I rather would have lost my life betimes

	Men's flesh preserv'd so whole do seldom win.

	What! worse than nought? nay, then a shame take all.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	I will, my lord, so please his majesty.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	I am content: provide me soldiers, lords,
	Whiles I take order for mine own affairs.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	My Lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days
	At Bristol I expect my soldiers;
	For there I'll ship them all for Ireland.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts,
	And change misdoubt to resolution:
	Be that thou hop'st to be, or what thou art
	Resign to death; it is not worth the enjoying.
	Let pale-fac'd fear keep with the mean-born man,
	And find no harbour in a royal heart.
	Faster than spring-time showers comes thought on thought,
	And not a thought but thinks on dignity.
	My brain, more busy than the labouring spider,
	Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.
	Well, nobles, well; 'tis politicly done,
	To send me packing with a host of men:
	I fear me you but warm the starved snake,
	Who, cherish'd in your breasts, will sting your hearts.
	'Twas men I lack'd, and you will give them me:
	I take it kindly; yet be well assur'd
	You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.
	Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,
	I will stir up in England some black storm
	Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;
	And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
	Until the golden circuit on my head,
	Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams,
	Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.
	And, for a minister of my intent,
	I have seduc'd a headstrong Kentishman,
	John Cade of Ashford,
	To make commotion, as full well he can,
	Under the title of John Mortimer.
	In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
	Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,
	And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts
	Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine:
	And, in the end being rescu'd, I have seen
	Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,
	Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.
	Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,
	Hath he conversed with the enemy,
	And undiscover'd come to me again,
	And given me notice of their villanies.
	This devil here shall be my substitute;
	For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,
	In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble;
	By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,
	How they affect the house and claim of York.
	Say he be taken, rack'd, and tortured,
	I know no pain they can inflict upon him
	Will make him say I mov'd him to those arms.
	Say that he thrive,—as 'tis great like he will,—
	Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength,
	And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;
	For, Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,
	And Henry put apart, the next for me.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right,
	And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head:
	Ring, bells, aloud; burn, bonfires, clear and bright,
	To entertain great England's lawful king.
	Ah sancta majestas, who would not buy thee dear?
	Let them obey that know not how to rule;
	This hand was made to handle nought but gold:
	I cannot give due action to my words,
	Except a sword, or sceptre balance it.
	A sceptre shall it have, have I-a soul,
	On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France.
	Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me?
	The king hath sent him, sure: I must dissemble.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
	Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.
	Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?

	</STAGE DIR> Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great:
	O! I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,

	On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.
	I am far better born than is the king,
	More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts;
	But I must make fair weather yet awhile,
	Till Henry be more weak, and I more strong.
	</STAGE DIR> Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me,
	That I have given no answer all this while;
	My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.
	The cause why I have brought this army hither
	Is to remove proud Somerset from the king,
	Seditious to his Grace and to the state.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	Upon thine honour, is he a prisoner?
<SPEECH 40><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>

	Soldiers, I thank you all; disperse yourselves;
	Meet me to-morrow in Saint George's field,
	You shall have pay, and everything you wish,
	And let my sov'reign, virtuous Henry,
	Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,
	As pledges of my fealty and love;
	I'll send them all as willing as I live:
	Lands, goods, horse, armour, anything I have
	Is his to use, so Somerset may die.

	Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
	King did I call thee? no, thou art not king;
	Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,
	Which dar'st not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.
	That head of thine doth not become a crown;
	Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff,
	And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.
	That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,
	Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles' spear,
	Is able with the change to kill and cure.
	Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up,
	And with the same to act controlling laws.
