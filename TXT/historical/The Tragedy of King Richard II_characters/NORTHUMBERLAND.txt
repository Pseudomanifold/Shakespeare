	My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
	Nay, nothing; all is said:
	His tongue is now a stringless instrument;
	Words, life, and all, old Lancaster hath spent.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><31%>
	Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><31%>
	Richly in both, if justice had her right.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><32%>
	Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more
	That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><32%>
	Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
	In him, a royal prince, and many more
	Of noble blood in this declining land.
	The king is not himself, but basely led
	By flatterers; and what they will inform,
	Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all,
	That will the king severely prosecute
	'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><32%>
	Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,
	But basely yielded upon compromise
	That which his ancestors achiev'd with blows.
	More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>
	Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>
	His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!
	But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,
	Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm;
	We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,
	And yet we strike not, but securely perish.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>
	Not so: even through the hollow eyes of death
	Ispy life peering; but I dare not say
	How near the tidings of our comfort is.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>
	Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay
	In Brittany, receiv'd intelligence
	That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,
	That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,
	His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,
	Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,
	Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton, and Francis Quoint,
	All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Britaine,
	With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,
	Are making hither with all due expedience,
	And shortly mean to touch our northern shore.
	Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay
	The first departing of the king for Ireland.
	If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,
	Imp out our drooping country's broken wing,
	Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
	Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt,
	And make high majesty look like itself,
	Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;
	But if you faint, as fearing to do so,
	Stay and be secret, and myself will go.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
	Believe me, noble lord,
	I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:
	These high wild hills and rough uneven ways
	Draw out our miles and make them wearisome;
	But yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,
	Making the hard way sweet and delectable.
	But I bethink me what a weary way
	From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found
	In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,
	Which, I protest, hath very much beguil'd
	The tediousness and process of my travel:
	But theirs is sweeten'd with the hope to have
	The present benefit which I possess;
	And hope to joy is little less in joy
	Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords
	Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done
	By sight of what I have, your noble company.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
	It is my son, young Harry Percy,
	Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.
	Harry, how fares your uncle?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
	Why, is he not with the queen?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
	What was his reason?
	He was not so resolv'd when last we spake together.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
	Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
	Then learn to know him now: this is the duke.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
	How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir
	Keeps good old York there with his men of war?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
	Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
	Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 3><42%>
	It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 3><44%>
	The noble duke hath been too much abus'd.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 3><45%>
	The noble duke hath sworn his coming is
	But for his own; and for the right of that
	We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;
	And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
	The news is very fair and good, my lord:
	Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
	Your Grace mistakes; only to be brief
	Left I his title out.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
	O! belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	The king of heaven forbid our lord the king
	Should so with civil and uncivil arms
	Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice-noble cousin,
	Harry Bolingbroke, doth humbly kiss thy hand;
	And by the honourable tomb he swears,
	That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,
	And by the royalties of both your bloods,
	Currents that spring from one most gracious head,
	And by the buried hand of war-like Gaunt,
	And by the worth and honour of himself,
	Comprising all that may be sworn or said,
	His coming hither hath no further scope
	Than for his lineal royalties and to beg
	Enfranchisement immediate on his knees:
	Which on thy royal party granted once,
	His glittering arms he will commend to rust,
	His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart
	To faithful service of your majesty.
	This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;
	And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 3><62%>
	My lord, in the base court he doth attend
	To speak with you; may't please you to come down?
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 3><62%>
	Sorrow and grief of heart
	Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man:
	Yet he is come.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 1><73%>
	Well have you argu'd, sir; and, for your pains,
	Of capital treason we arrest you here.
	My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge
	To keep him safely till his day of trial.
	May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit?
<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 1><75%>
	</STAGE DIR> No more, but that you read
	These accusations and these grievous crimes
	Committed by your person and your followers
	Against the state and profit of this land;
	That, by confessing them, the souls of men
	May deem that you are worthily depos'd.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 1><76%>
	My lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 1><76%>
	My lord,â€”

	Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 1><77%>
	The commons will not then be satisfied.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
	My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is chang'd;
	You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.
	And, madam, there is order ta'en for you;
	With all swift speed you must away to France.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
	My guilt be on my head, and there an end.
	Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	That were some love but little policy.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 5><SCENE 6><98%>
	First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.
	The next news is: I have to London sent
	The heads of Salisbury, Spencer, Blunt, and Kent.
	The manner of their taking may appear
	At large discoursed in this paper here.
