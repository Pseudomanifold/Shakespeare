	I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
	No, my good lord; he hath forsook the court,
	Broken his staff of office, and dispers'd
	The household of the king.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
	Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.
	But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,
	To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,
	And sent me over by Berkeley to discover
	What power the Duke of York had levied there;
	Then with direction to repair to Ravenspurgh.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
	No, my good lord; for that is not forgot
	Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge
	I never in my life did look on him.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
	My gracious lord, I tender you my service,
	Such as it is, being tender, raw, and young,
	Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
	To more approved service and desert.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
	There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,
	Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;
	And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;
	None else of name and noble estimate.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
	The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,
	Against thy entrance.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
	Yes, my good lord,
	It doth contain a king: King Richard lies
	Within the limits of yon lime and stone;
	And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,
	Sir Stephen Scroop; besides a clergyman
	Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
	See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,
	As doth the blushing discontented sun
	From out the fiery portal of the east,
	When he perceives the envious clouds are bent
	To dim his glory and to stain the track
	Of his bright passage to the occident.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
	Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true
	In this appeal as thou art all unjust;
	And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,
	To prove it on thee to the extremest point
	Of mortal breathing: seize it if thou dar'st.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
	My lord, some two days since I saw the prince,
	And told him of these triumphs held at Oxford.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
	His answer was: he would unto the stews,
	And from the common'st creature pluck a glove,
	And wear it as a favour; and with that
	He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 6><99%>
	The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,
	With clog of conscience and sour melancholy,
	Hath yielded up his body to the grave;
	But here is Carlisle living, to abide
	Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.
