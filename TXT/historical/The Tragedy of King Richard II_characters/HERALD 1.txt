<SPEECH 1><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,
	Stands here for God, his sovereign, and himself,
	On pain to be found false and recreant,
	To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,
	A traitor to his God, his king, and him;
	And dares him to set forward to the fight.
