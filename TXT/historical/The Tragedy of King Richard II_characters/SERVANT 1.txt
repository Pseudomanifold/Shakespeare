	Why should we in the compass of a pale
	Keep law and form and due proportion,
	Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,

	Her fruit-trees all unprun'd, her hedges ruin'd,
	Her knots disorder'd, and her wholesome herbs
	Swarming with caterpillars?

	What! think you then the king shall be depos'd?
