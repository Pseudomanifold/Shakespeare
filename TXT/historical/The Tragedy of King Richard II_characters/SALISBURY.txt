	Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman:
	The king reposeth all his confidence in thee.

	Ah, Richard! with the eyes of heavy mind
	I see thy glory like a shooting star
	Fall to the base earth from the firmament.
	Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,
	Witnessing storms to come, woe, and unrest.
	Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes,
	And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.

	Nor near nor further off, my gracious lord,
	Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue
	And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
	One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,
	Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth.
	O! call back yesterday, bid time return,
	And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men:
	To-day, to-day, unhappy day too late,
	O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune, and thy state;
	For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead,
	Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispers'd, and fled.
