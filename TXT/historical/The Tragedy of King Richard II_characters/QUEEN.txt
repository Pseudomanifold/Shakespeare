	How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
	To please the king I did; to please myself
	I cannot do it; yet I know no cause
	Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,
	Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
	As my sweet Richard: yet, again, methinks,
	Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,
	Is coming towards me, and my inward soul
	With nothing trembles; at some thing it grieves
	More than with parting from my lord the king.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
	It may be so; but yet my inward soul
	Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,
	I cannot but be sad, so heavy sad,
	As, though in thinking on no thought I think,
	Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
	'Tis nothing less: conceit is still deriv'd
	From some forefather grief; mine is not so,
	For nothing hath begot my something grief;
	Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:
	'Tis in reversion that I do possess;
	But what it is, that is not yet known; what
	I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 2><36%>
	Why hop'st thou so? 'tis better hope he is,
	For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:
	Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 2><36%>
	Now God in heaven forbid!
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 2><36%>
	So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,
	And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:
	Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,
	And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,
	Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><36%>
	Who shall hinder me?
	I will despair, and be at enmity
	With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,
	A parasite, a keeper-back of death,
	Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,
	Which false hope lingers in extremity.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><37%>
	With signs of war about his aged neck:
	O! full of careful business are his looks.
	Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 4><63%>
	What sport shall we devise here in this garden,
	To drive away the heavy thought of care?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 4><63%>
	'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs;
	And that my fortune runs against the bias.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 4><64%>
	My legs can keep no measure in delight
	When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:
	Therefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 4><64%>
	Of sorrow or of joy?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 4><64%>
	Of neither, girl:
	For if of joy, being altogether wanting,
	It doth remember me the more of sorrow;
	Or if of grief, being altogether had,
	It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:
	For what I have I need not to repeat,
	And what I want it boots not to complain.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 4><64%>
	'Tis well that thou hast cause;
	But thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 4><64%>
	And I could sing would weeping do me good,
	And never borrow any tear of thee.
	But stay, here come the gardeners:
	Let's step into the shadow of these trees.
	My wretchedness unto a row of pins,
	They'll talk of state; for every one doth so
	Against a change: woe is forerun with woe.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 4><66%>
	O! I am press'd to death through want of speaking.
	Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,
	How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?
	What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee
	To make a second fall of cursed man?
	Why dost thou say King Richard is depos'd?
	Dar'st thou, thou little better thing than earth,
	Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how
	Cam'st thou by these ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 4><67%>
	Nimble mischance. that art so light of foot,
	Doth not thy embassage belong to me,
	And am I last that knows it? O! thou think'st
	To serve me last, that I may longest keep
	Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,
	To meet at London London's king in woe.
	What! was I born to this, that my sad look
	Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?
	Gardener, for telling me these news of woe,
	Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
	This way the king will come; this is the way
	To Julius CÃ¦sar's ill-erected tower,
	To whose flint bosom my condemned lord
	Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke.
	Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth
	Have any resting for her true king's queen.
	But soft, but see, or rather do not see,
	My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,
	That you in pity may dissolve to dew,
	And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.
	Ah! thou, the model where old Troy did stand,
	Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,
	And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,
	Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodg'd in thee,
	When triumph is become an alehouse guest?
<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
	What! is my Richard both in shape and mind
	Transform'd and weaken'd! Hath Bolingbroke depos'd
	Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?
	The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw
	And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage
	To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,
	Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,
	And fawn on rage with base humility,
	Which art a lion and a king of beasts?
<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	And must we be divided? must we part?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	Banish us both and send the king with me.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	Then whither he goes, thither let me go.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	So longest way shall have the longest moans.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
	To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.
	So, now I have mine own again, be gone,
	That I may strive to kill it with a groan.
