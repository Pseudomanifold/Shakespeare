	Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,
	Suddenly taken, and hath sent post-haste
	To entreat your majesty to visit him.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 4><23%>
	At Ely House.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
	Madam, your majesty is too much sad:
	You promis'd, when you parted with the king,
	To lay aside life-harming heaviness,
	And entertain a cheerful disposition.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
	Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
	Which show like grief itself, but are not so.
	For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,
	Divides one thing entire to many objects;
	Like perspectives, which rightly gaz'd upon
	Show nothing but confusion; ey'd awry
	Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,
	Looking awry upon your lord's departure,
	Finds shapes of grief more than himself to wail;
	Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows
	Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
	More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;
	Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,
	Which for things true weeps things imaginary.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
	'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 2><36%>
	Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
	And all the rest of the revolted faction traitors?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 2><36%>
	Despair not, madam.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><38%>
	The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,
	But none returns. For us to levy power
	Proportionable to the enemy
	Is all unpossible.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><39%>
	Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 2><39%>
	Thither will I with you; for little office
	Will the hateful commons perform for us,
	Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.
	Will you go along with us?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 2><39%>
	That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 2><39%>
	Well, we may meet again.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	More welcome is the stroke of death to me
	Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.
