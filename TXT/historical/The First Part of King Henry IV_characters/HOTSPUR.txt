	My liege, I did deny no prisoners:
	But I remember, when the fight was done,
	When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
	Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
	Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,
	Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin, new reap'd,
	Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home:
	He was perfumed like a milliner,
	And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
	A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
	He gave his nose and took't away again;
	Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
	Took it in snuff: and still he smil'd and talk'd;
	And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
	He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
	To bring a slovenly unhandsome corpse
	Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
	With many holiday and lady terms
	He question'd me; among the rest, demanded
	My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
	I then all smarting with my wounds being cold,
	To be so pester'd with a popinjay,
	Out of my grief and my impatience
	Answer'd neglectingly, I know not what,
	He should, or he should not; for he made me mad
	To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
	And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
	Of guns, and drums, and wounds,—God save the mark!—
	And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
	Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
	And that it was great pity, so it was,
	This villanous saltpetre should be digg'd
	Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
	Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
	So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
	He would himself have been a soldier.
	This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,
	I answer'd indirectly, as I said;
	And I beseech you, let not his report
	Come current for an accusation
	Betwixt my love and your high majesty.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 3><13%>
	Revolted Mortimer!
	He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
	But by the chance of war: to prove that true
	Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,
	Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took,
	When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,
	In single opposition, hand to hand,
	He did confound the best part of an hour
	In changing hardiment with great Glendower.
	Three times they breath'd and three times did they drink,
	Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood,
	Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
	Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,
	And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank
	Blood-stained with these valiant combatants.
	Never did base and rotten policy
	Colour her working with such deadly wounds;
	Nor never could the noble Mortimer
	Receive so many, and all willingly:
	Then let him not be slander'd with revolt.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	An if the devil come and roar for them,
	I will not send them: I will after straight
	And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,
	Albeit I make a hazard of my head.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	Speak of Mortimer!
	'Zounds! I will speak of him; and let my soul
	Want mercy if I do not join with him:
	In his behalf I'll empty all these veins,
	And shed my dear blood drop by drop i' the dust,
	But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer
	As high i' the air as this unthankful king,
	As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;
	And when I urg'd the ransom once again
	Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,
	And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,
	Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	But, soft! I pray you, did King Richard then
	Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
	Heir to the crown?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,
	That wish'd him on the barren mountains starve.
	But shall it be that you, that set the crown
	Upon the head of this forgetful man,
	And for his sake wear the detested blot
	Of murd'rous subornation, shall it be,
	That you a world of curses undergo,
	Being the agents, or base second means,
	The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?
	O! pardon me that I descend so low,
	To show the line and the predicament
	Wherein you range under this subtle king.
	Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
	Or fill up chronicles in time to come,
	That men of your nobility and power,
	Did gage them both in'an unjust behalf,
	As both of you—God pardon it!—have done,
	To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,
	And plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?
	And shall it in more shame be further spoken,
	That you are fool'd, discarded, and shook off
	By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
	No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem
	Your banish'd honours, and restore yourselves
	Into the good thoughts of the world again;
	Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
	Of this proud king, who studies day and night
	To answer all the debt he owes to you,
	Even with the bloody payment of your deaths.
	Therefore, I say,—
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:

	By heaven methinks it were an easy leap
	To pluck bright honour from the pale-fac'd moon,

	Nay, I will; that's flat:

	Nay,
	I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak

	Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth

	By the imprisoning of unruly wind
	Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,
	Shakes the old beldam earth, and topples down

	A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
	I'll have the current in this place damm'd up,
	And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
	In a new channel, fair and evenly:
	It shall not wind with such a deep indent,
	To rob me of so rich a bottom here.

	A couching lion, and a ramping cat,
	And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
	As puts me from my faith. I'll tell thee what;
	He held me last night at least nine hours
	In reckoning up the several devils' names
	That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum!' and 'well, go to.'
	But mark'd him not a word. O! he's as tedious
	As a tired horse, a railing wife;
	Worse than a smoky house. I had rather live
	With cheese and garlick in a windmill, far,

	Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
	The very life-blood of our enterprise;
	'Tis catching hither, even to our camp,

	And that his friends by deputation could not
	So soon be drawn; nor did he think it meet
	To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
	On any soul remov'd but on his own.
	Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,
	That with our small conjunction we should on,
	To see how fortune is dispos'd to us;
	For, as he writes, there is no quailing now,
	Because the king is certainly possess'd
	Of all our purposes. What say you to it?
<SPEECH 66><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:
	And yet, in faith, 'tis not; his present want

	All at one cast? to set so rich a main
	On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?

	Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God
	You were of our determination!
	Some of us love you well; and even those some

	But stand against us like an enemy.
<SPEECH 81><ACT 4><SCENE 3><79%>
	The king is kind; and well we know the king
	Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
	My father and my uncle and myself
	Did give him that same royalty he wears;
	And when he was not six-and-twenty strong,
	Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,
	A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
	My father gave him welcome to the shore;
	And when he heard him swear and vow to God
	He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,
	To sue his livery and beg his peace,
	With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,
	My father, in kind heart and pity mov'd,
	Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.
	Now when the lords and barons of the realm
	Perceiv'd Northumberland did lean to him,
	The more and less came in with cap and knee;
	Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,
	Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,
	Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,
	Gave him their heirs as pages, follow'd him
	Even at the heels in golden multitudes.
	He presently, as greatness knows itself,
	Steps me a little higher than his vow
	Made to my father, while his blood was poor,
	Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;
	And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform
	Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
	That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,
	Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep
	Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,
	This seeming brow of justice, did he win
	The hearts of all that he did angle for;
	Proceeded further; cut me off the heads
	Of all the favourites that the absent king
	In deputation left behind him here,
	When he was personal in the Irish war.
<SPEECH 82><ACT 4><SCENE 3><80%>
	Then to the point.
	In short time after, he depos'd the king;
	Soon after that, depriv'd him of his life;
	And, in the neck of that, task'd the whole state;
	To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March—
	Who is, if every owner were well plac'd,
	Indeed his king—to be engag'd in Wales,
	There without ransom to lie forfeited;
	Disgrac'd me in my happy victories;
	Sought to entrap me by intelligence;
	Rated my uncle from the council-board;
	In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;
	Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong;
	And in conclusion drove us to seek out
	This head of safety; and withal to pry
	Into his title, the which we find
	Too indirect for long continuance.
<SPEECH 83><ACT 4><SCENE 3><81%>
	Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.
	Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd
	Some surety for a safe return again,
	And in the morning early shall my uncle
	Bring him our purposes; and so farewell.
<SPEECH 84><ACT 4><SCENE 3><81%>
	And may be so we shall.
<SPEECH 85><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
	My uncle is return'd: deliver up
	My Lord of Westmoreland. Uncle, what news?
<SPEECH 86><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
	Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.
<SPEECH 87><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
	Did you beg any? God forbid!
<SPEECH 88><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
	O! would the quarrel lay upon our heads,
	And that no man might draw short breath to-day
	But I and Harry Monmouth. Tell me, tell me,
	How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt?
<SPEECH 89><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	Cousin, I think thou art enamoured
	On his follies: never did I hear
	Of any prince so wild a libertine.
	But be he as he will, yet once ere night
	I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,
	That he shall shrink under my courtesy.
	Arm, arm, with speed! And, fellows, soldiers, friends,
	Better consider what you have to do,
	Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,
	Can lift your blood up with persuasion.
<SPEECH 90><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	I cannot read them now.
	O gentlemen! the time of life is short;
	To spend that shortness basely were too long,
	If life did ride upon a dial's point,
	Still ending at the arrival of an hour.
	An if we live, we live to tread on kings;
	If die, brave death, when princes die with us!
	Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair,
	When the intent of bearing them is just.
<SPEECH 91><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	I thank him that he cuts me from my tale,
	For I profess not talking. Only this,—
	Let each man do his best: and here draw I
	A sword, whose temper I intend to stain
	With the best blood that I can meet withal
	In the adventure of this perilous day.
	Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on.
	Sound all the lofty instruments of war,
	And by that music let us all embrace;
	For, heaven to earth, some of us never shall
	A second time do such a courtesy.
<SPEECH 92><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	O, Douglas! hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,
	I never had triumph'd upon a Scot.
<SPEECH 93><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	Where?
<SPEECH 94><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	This, Douglas! no; I know this face full well;
	A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;
	Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.
<SPEECH 95><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	The king hath many marching in his coats.
<SPEECH 96><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	Up, and away!
	Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.
<SPEECH 97><ACT 5><SCENE 4><94%>
	If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.
<SPEECH 98><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
	My name is Harry Percy.
<SPEECH 99><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
	Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come
	To end the one of us; and would to God
	Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!
<SPEECH 100><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
	I can no longer brook thy vanities.
<SPEECH 101><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
	O, Harry! thou hast robb'd me of my youth.
	I better brook the loss of brittle life
	Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;
	They wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh:
	But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;
	And time, that takes survey of all the world,
	Must have a stop. O! I could prophesy,
	But that the earthy and cold hand of death
	Lies on my tongue. No, Percy, thou art dust,
	And food for—
