	The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,
	Whatever Harry Percy then had said
	To such a person and in such a place,
	At such a time, with all the rest re-told,
	May reasonably die and never rise
	To do him wrong, or any way impeach
	What then he said, so he unsay it now.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 2><63%>
	So hath the business that I come to speak of.
	Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
	That Douglas and the English rebels met,
	The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury.
	A mighty and a fearful head they are,—
	If promises be kept on every hand,—
	As ever offer'd foul play in a state.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	I come with gracious offers from the king,
	If you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	And God defend but still I should stand so,
	So long as out of limit and true rule
	You stand against anointed majesty.
	But, to my charge. The king hath sent to know
	The nature of your griefs, and whereupon
	You conjure from the breast of civil peace
	Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land
	Audacious cruelty. If that the king
	Have any way your good deserts forgot,—
	Which he confesseth to be manifold,—
	He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed
	You shall have your desires with interest,
	And pardon absolute for yourself and these
	Herein misled by your suggestion.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 3><80%>
	Tut, I came not to hear this.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 3><80%>
	Shall I return this answer to the king?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 3><81%>
	I would you would accept of grace and love.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 3><81%>
	Pray God, you do!
<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	What is thy name, that in the battle thus
	Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek
	Upon my head?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	They tell thee true.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;
	And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
	Lord Stafford's death.
