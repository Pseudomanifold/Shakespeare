	O, my good lord! why are you thus alone?
	For what offence have I this fortnight been
	A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?
	Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee
	Thy stomach, pleasure, and thy golden sleep?
	Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,
	And start so often when thou sitt'st alone?
	Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks,
	And given my treasures and my rights of thee
	To thick-eyed musing and curst melancholy?
	In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,
	And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars,
	Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed,
	Cry, 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd
	Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,
	Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,
	Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,
	Of prisoners' ransom, and of soldiers slain,
	And all the currents of a heady fight.
	Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war,
	And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,
	That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow,
	Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;
	And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,
	Such as we see when men restrain their breath
	On some great sudden hest. O! what portents are these?
	Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,
	And I must know it, else he loves me not.

	But hear you, my lord.

	What is it carries you away?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
	Out, you mad-headed ape!
	A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
	As you are toss'd with. In faith,
	I'll know your business, Harry, that I will.
	I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir
	About his title, and hath sent for you
	To line his enterprise. But if you goâ€”
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
	Come, come, you paraquito, answer me
	Directly unto this question that I ask.
	In faith, I'll break thy little finger, Harry,
	An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
	Do you not love me? do you not, indeed?
	Well, do not, then; for since you love me not,
	I will not love myself. Do you not love me?
	Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.

	How! so far?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
	It must, of force.

	Then should you be nothing but musical for you are altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief, and hear the lady sing in Welsh.

	Now, God help thee!
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><57%>
	What's that?

	Not mine, in good sooth.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 1><57%>
	I will not sing.
