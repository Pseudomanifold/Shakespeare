	So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
	Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,
	And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
	To be commenc'd in stronds afar remote.
	No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
	Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;
	No more shall trenching war channel her fields,
	Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
	Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,
	Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
	All of one nature, of one substance bred,
	Did lately meet in the intestine shock
	And furious close of civil butchery,
	Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,
	March all one way, and be no more oppos'd
	Against acquaintance, kindred, and allies:
	The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
	No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
	As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,—
	Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
	We are impressed and engag'd to fight,—
	Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,
	Whose arms were moulded in their mother's womb
	To chase these pagans in those holy fields
	Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
	Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
	For our advantage on the bitter cross.
	But this our purpose is a twelvemonth old,
	And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:
	Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
	Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
	What yesternight our council did decree
	In forwarding this dear expedience.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	It seems then that the tidings of this broil
	Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Here is a dear and true industrious friend,
	Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse,
	Stain'd with the variation of each soil
	Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;
	And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
	The Earl of Douglas is discomfited;
	Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,
	Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
	On Holmedon's plains: of prisoners Hotspur took
	Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son
	To beaten Douglas, and the Earls of Athol,
	Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith.
	And is not this an honourable spoil?
	A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Yea, there thou mak'st me sad and mak'st me sin
	In envy that my Lord Northumberland
	Should be the father to so blest a son,
	A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;
	Amongst a grove the very straightest plant;
	Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:
	Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
	See riot and dishonour stain the brow
	Of my young Harry. O! that it could be prov'd
	That some night-tripping fairy had exchang'd
	In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
	And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet.
	Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.
	But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
	Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,
	Which he in this adventure hath surpris'd,
	To his own use he keeps, and sends me word,
	I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	But I have sent for him to answer this;
	And for this cause a while we must neglect
	Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
	Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we
	Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:
	But come yourself with speed to us again;
	For more is to be said and to be done
	Than out of anger can be uttered.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><11%>
	My blood hath been too cold and temperate,
	Unapt to stir at these indignities,
	And you have found me; for accordingly
	You tread upon my patience: but, be sure,
	I will from henceforth rather be myself,
	Mighty, and to be fear'd, than my condition,
	Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,
	And therefore lost that title of respect
	Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><11%>
	Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see
	Danger and disobedience in thine eye.
	O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
	And majesty might never yet endure
	The moody frontier of a servant brow.
	You have good leave to leave us; when we need
	Your use and counsel we shall send for you.
	</STAGE DIR> You were about to speak.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 3><13%>
	Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,
	But with proviso and exception,
	That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
	His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;
	Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd
	The lives of those that he did lead to fight
	Against the great magician, damn'd Glendower,
	Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March
	Hath lately married. Shall our coffers then
	Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
	Shall we buy treason, and indent with fears,
	When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
	No, on the barren mountains let him starve;
	For I shall never hold that man my friend
	Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
	To ransom home revolted Mortimer.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him:
	He never did encounter with Glendower:
	I tell thee,
	He durst as well have met the devil alone
	As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
	Art thou not asham'd? But, sirrah, henceforth
	Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:
	Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,
	Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
	As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,
	We license your departure with your son.
	Send us your prisoners, or you'll hear of it.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I
	Must have some private conference: but be near at hand,
	For we shall presently have need of you.
	I know not whether God will have it so,
	For some displeasing service I have done,
	That, in his secret doom, out of my blood
	He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;
	But thou dost in thy passages of life
	Make me believe that thou art only mark'd
	For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
	To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,
	Could such inordinate and low desires,
	Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,
	Such barren pleasures, rude society,
	As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,
	Accompany the greatness of thy blood
	And hold their level with thy princely heart?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
	God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,
	At thy affections, which do hold a wing
	Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
	Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost,
	Which by thy younger brother is supplied,
	And art almost an alien to the hearts
	Of all the court and princes of my blood.
	The hope and expectation of thy time
	Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man
	Prophetically do forethink thy fall.
	Had I so lavish of my presence been,
	So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,
	So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
	Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
	Had still kept loyal to possession
	And left me in reputeless banishment,
	A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
	By being seldom seen, I could not stir,
	But like a comet I was wonder'd at;
	That men would tell their children, 'This is he;'
	Others would say, 'Where? which is Bolingbroke?'
	And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
	And dress'd myself in such humility
	That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,
	Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,
	Even in the presence of the crowned king.
	Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;
	My presence, like a robe pontifical,
	Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,
	Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast,
	And won by rareness such solemnity.
	The skipping king, he ambled up and down
	With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,
	Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,
	Mingled his royalty with capering fools,
	Had his great name profaned with their scorns,
	And gave his countenance, against his name,
	To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
	Of every beardless vain comparative;
	Grew a companion to the common streets,
	Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
	That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,
	They surfeited with honey and began
	To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little
	More than a little is by much too much.
	So, when he had occasion to be seen,
	He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
	Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes
	As, sick and blunted with community,
	Afford no extraordinary gaze,
	Such as is bent on sun-like majesty
	When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;
	But rather drows'd and hung their eyelids down,
	Slept in his face, and render'd such aspect
	As cloudy men use to their adversaries,
	Being with his presence glutted, gorg'd, and full.
	And in that very line, Harry, stand'st thou;
	For thou hast lost thy princely privilege
	With vile participation: not an eye
	But is aweary of thy common sight,
	Save mine, which hath desir'd to see thee more;
	Which now doth that I would not have it do,
	Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 2><60%>
	For all the world,
	As thou art to this hour was Richard then
	When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh;
	And even as I was then is Percy now.
	Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,
	He hath more worthy interest to the state
	Than thou the shadow of succession;
	For of no right, nor colour like to right,
	He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
	Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,
	And, being no more in debt to years than thou,
	Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
	To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
	What never-dying honour hath he got
	Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,
	Whose hot incursions and great name in arms,
	Holds from all soldiers chief majority,
	And military title capital,
	Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ.
	Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
	This infant warrior, in his enterprises
	Discomfited great Douglas; ta'en him once,
	Enlarged him and made a friend of him,
	To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
	And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
	And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
	The Archbishop's Grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,
	Capitulate against us and are up.
	But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
	Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,
	Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?
	Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,
	Base inclination, and the start of spleen,
	To fight against me under Percy's pay,
	To dog his heels, and curtsy at his frowns,
	To show how much thou art degenerate.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 2><62%>
	A hundred thousand rebels die in this:
	Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.
	How now, good Blunt! thy looks are full of speed.

	The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day,
	With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster;
	For this advertisement is five days old.
	On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward;
	On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting
	Is Bridgenorth; and Harry, you shall march
	Through Gloucestershire; by which account,
	Our business valued, some twelve days hence
	Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.
	Our hands are full of business: let's away;
	Advantage feeds him fat while men delay.

	Then with the losers let it sympathize,
	For nothing can seem foul to those that win.
	How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well
	That you and I should meet upon such terms
	As now we meet. You have deceiv'd our trust,
	And made us doff our easy robes of peace,
	To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:
	This is not well, my lord; this is not well.
	What say you to it? will you again unknit
	This churlish knot of all-abhorred war,
	And move in that obedient orb again
	Where you did give a fair and natural light,
	And be no more an exhal'd meteor,
	A prodigy of fear and a portent
	Of broached mischief to the unborn times?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	You have not sought it! how comes it then?
<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	These things indeed, you have articulate,
	Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,
	To face the garment of rebellion
	With some fine colour that may please the eye
	Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,
	Which gape and rub the elbow at the news
	Of hurlyburly innovation:
	And never yet did insurrection want
	Such water-colours to impaint his cause;
	Nor moody beggars, starving for a time
	Of pell-mell havoc and confusion.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,
	Albeit considerations infinite
	Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,
	We love our people well; even those we love
	That are misled upon your cousin's part;
	And, will they take the offer of our grace,
	Both he and they and you, yea, every man
	Shall be my friend again, and I'll be his.
	So tell your cousin, and bring me word
	What he will do; but if he will not yield,
	Rebuke and dread correction wait on us,
	And they shall do their office. So, be gone:
	We will not now be troubled with reply;
	We offer fair, take it advisedly.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge;
	For, on their answer, will we set on them;
	And God befriend us, as our cause is just!
<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 4><92%>
	I prithee,
	Harry, withdraw thyself; thou bleed'st too much.
	Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 4><93%>
	I will do so.
	My Lord of Westmoreland, lead him to his tent.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 4><93%>

	I will assay thee; so defend thyself.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 4><94%>
	Stay, and breathe awhile.
	Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,

	Ill-spirited Worcester! did we not send grace,
	Pardon, and terms of love to all of you?
	And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?
	Misuse the tenour of thy kinsman's trust?
	Three knights upon our party slain to-day,
	A noble earl and many a creature else
	Had been alive this hour,
	If like a Christian, thou hadst truly borne
	Betwixt our armies true intelligence.

	Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too:

<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 5><100%>
	Then this remains, that we divide our power.
	You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland
	Towards York shall bend you, with your dearest speed,
	To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,
	Who, as we hear, are busily in arms:
	Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales,
	To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.
	Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,
	Meeting the check of such another day:
	And since this business so fair is done,
	Let us not leave till all our own be won.
