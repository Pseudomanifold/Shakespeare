	These promises are fair, the parties sure,
	And our induction full of prosperous hope.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	Peace, cousin Percy! you will make him mad.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	Come, come;
	No more of this unprofitable chat.

	The archdeacon hath divided it
	Into three limits very equally.
	England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
	By south and east, is to my part assign'd:
	All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,
	And all the fertile land within that bound,
	To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you
	The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.
	And our indentures tripartite are drawn,
	Which being sealed interchangeably,
	A business that this night may execute,
	To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I
	And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
	To meet your father and the Scottish power,
	As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.
	My father Glendower is not ready yet,
	Nor shall we need his help these fourteen days.
	</STAGE DIR> Within that space you may have drawn together
	Your tenants, friends, and neighbouring gentlemen.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
	Yea, but
	Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up
	With like advantage on the other side;
	Gelding the opposed continent as much,
	As on the other side it takes from you.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 1><54%>
	Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 1><54%>
	In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,
	Exceedingly well read, and profited
	In strange concealments, valiant as a lion
	And wondrous affable, and as bountiful
	As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?
	He holds your temper in a high respect,
	And curbs himself even of his natural scope
	When you do cross his humour; faith, he does.
	I warrant you, that man is not alive
	Might so have tempted him as you have done,
	Without the taste of danger and reproof:
	But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
	This is the deadly spite that angers me,
	My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
	Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy,
	Shall follow in your conduct speedily.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
	I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh
	Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens
	I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,
	In such a parley would I answer thee.
	I understand thy kisses and thou mine,
	And that's a feeling disputation:
	But I will never be a truant, love,
	Till I have learn'd thy language; for thy tongue
	Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,
	Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,
	With ravishing division, to her lute.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
	O! I am ignorance itself in this.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
	With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:
	By that time will our book, I think, be drawn.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><58%>
	With all my heart.
