	Thou art the king of honour:
	No man so potent breathes upon the ground
	But I will beard him.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	Faith, and so we should;
	Where now remains a sweet reversion:
	We may boldly spend upon the hope of what
	Is to come in:
	A comfort of retirement lives in this.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 1><73%>
	As heart can think: there is not such a word
	Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 1><74%>
	That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 1><74%>
	Talk not of dying: I am out of fear
	Of death or death's hand for this one half year.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	You give him then advantage.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	You do not counsel well:
	You speak it out of fear and cold heart.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	Yea, or to-night.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
	Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
	Marry, and shall, and very willingly.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
	Arm, gentlemen! to arms! for I have thrown
	A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,
	And Westmoreland, that was engag'd, did bear it;
	Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	Know then, my name is Douglas;
	And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
	Because some tell me that thou art a king.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought
	Thy likeness; for, instead of thee, King Harry,
	This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee,
	Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	All's done, all's won: here breathless lies the king.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	Here.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!
	A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear:
	Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;
	I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,
	Until I meet the king.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 4><93%>
	Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:
	I am the Douglas, fatal to all those
	That wear those colours on them: what art thou,
	That counterfeit'st the person of a king?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 4><94%>
	I fear thou art another counterfeit;
	And yet, in faith, thou bear'st thee like a king:
	But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be,
	And thus I win thee.
