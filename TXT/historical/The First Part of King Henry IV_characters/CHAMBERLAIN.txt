	Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what. They are up already and call for eggs and butter: they will away presently.

	No, I'll none of it: I prithee, keep that for the hangman; for I know thou worship'st Saint Nicholas as truly as a man of falsehood may.

	What! the commonwealth their boots? will she hold out water in foul way?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.
