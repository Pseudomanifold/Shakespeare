	Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves
	The scourge of greatness to be us'd on it;
	And that same greatness too which our own hands
	Have holp to make so portly.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	Who struck this heat up after I was gone?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	I cannot blame him: was he not proclaim'd
	By Richard that dead is the next of blood?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
	Live scandaliz'd and foully spoken of.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	Peace, cousin! say no more:
	And now I will unclasp a secret book,
	And to your quick-conceiving discontents
	I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,
	As full of peril and adventurous spirit
	As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud,
	On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	He apprehends a world of figures here,
	But not the form of what he should attend.
	Good cousin, give me audience for a while.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	Those same noble Scots
	That are your prisoners,—
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	You start away,
	And lend no ear unto my purposes.
	Those prisoners you shall keep.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	Hear you, cousin; a word.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	Farewell, kinsman: I will talk to you
	When you are better temper'd to attend.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	Nay, if you have not, to't again;
	We'll stay your leisure.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.
	Deliver them up without their ransom straight,
	And make the Douglas' son your only mean
	For powers in Scotland; which, for divers reasons
	Which I shall send you written, be assur'd,
	Will easily be granted. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> You, my lord,
	Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,
	Shall secretly into the bosom creep
	Of that same noble prelate well belov'd,
	The Archbishop.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
	True; who bears hard
	His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.
	I speak not this in estimation,
	As what I think might be, but what I know
	Is ruminated, plotted and set down;
	And only stays but to behold the face
	Of that occasion that shall bring it on.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
	And so they shall.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
	And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,
	To save our heads by raising of a head;
	For, bear ourselves as even as we can,
	The king will always think him in our debt,
	And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,
	Till he hath found a time to pay us home.
	And see already how he doth begin
	To make us strangers to his looks of love.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
	Cousin, farewell: no further go in this,
	Than I by letters shall direct your course.
	When time is ripe,—which will be suddenly,—
	I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer;
	Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,—
	As I will fashion it,—shall happily meet,
	To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,
	Which now we hold at much uncertainty.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 1><53%>
	Yea, but a little charge will trench him here,
	And on this north side win this cape of land;
	And then he runs straight and even.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
	In faith, my lord, you are too wilfulblame;
	And since your coming hither have done enough
	To put him quite beside his patience.
	You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:
	Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,—
	And that's the dearest grace it renders you,—
	Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,
	Defect of manners, want of government,
	Pride, haughtiness, opinion, and disdain:
	The least of which haunting a nobleman
	Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
	Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
	Beguiling them of commendation.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	I would the state of time had first been whole
	Ere he by sickness had been visited:
	His health was never better worth than now.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	But yet, I would your father had been here.
	The quality and hair of our attempt
	Brooks no division. It will be thought
	By some, that know not why he is away,
	That wisdom, loyalty, and mere dislike
	Of our proceedings, kept the earl from hence.
	And think how such an apprehension
	May turn the tide of fearful faction
	And breed a kind of question in our cause;
	For well you know we of the offering side
	Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,
	And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence
	The eye of reason may pry in upon us:
	This absence of your father's draws a curtain,
	That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
	Before not dreamt of.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 1><74%>
	Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	It may not be.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	Good cousin, be advis'd: stir not to-night.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	The number of the king exceedeth ours:
	For God's sake, cousin, stay till all come in.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	Hear me, my liege.
	For mine own part, I could be well content
	To entertain the lag-end of my life
	With quiet hours; for I do protest
	I have not sought the day of this dislike.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	It pleas'd your majesty to turn your looks
	Of favour from myself and all our house;
	And yet I must remember you, my lord,
	We were the first and dearest of your friends.
	For you my staff of office did I break
	In Richard's time; and posted day and night
	To meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,
	When yet you were in place and in account
	Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
	It was myself, my brother, and his son,
	That brought you home and boldly did outdare
	The dangers of the time. You swore to us,
	And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,
	That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state,
	Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,
	The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster.
	To this we swore our aid: but, in short space
	It rain'd down fortune showering on your head,
	And such a flood of greatness fell on you,
	What with our help, what with the absent king,
	What with the injuries of a wanton time,
	The seeming sufferances that you had borne,
	And the contrarious winds that held the king
	So long in his unlucky Irish wars,
	That all in England did repute him dead:
	And from this swarm of fair advantages
	You took occasion to be quickly woo'd
	To gripe the general sway into your hand;
	Forgot your oath to us at Doncaster;
	And being fed by us you us'd us so
	As that ungentle gull, the cuckoo's bird,
	Useth the sparrow: did oppress our nest,
	Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
	That even our love durst not come near your sight
	For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing
	We were enforc'd, for safety's sake, to fly
	Out of your sight and raise this present head;
	Whereby we stand opposed by such means
	As you yourself have forg'd against yourself
	By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,
	And violation of all faith and troth
	Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 2><87%>
	O, no! my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,
	The liberal kind offer of the king.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 2><87%>
	Then are we all undone.
	It is not possible, it cannot be,
	The king should keep his word in loving us;
	He will suspect us still, and find a time
	To punish this offence in other faults:
	Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;
	For treason is but trusted like the fox,
	Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd, and lock'd up,
	Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.
	Look how we can, or sad or merrily,
	Interpretation will misquote our looks,
	And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,
	The better cherish'd, still the nearer death.
	My nephew's trespass may be well forgot,
	It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood;
	And an adopted name of privilege,
	A hare-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen.
	All his offences live upon my head
	And on his father's: we did train him on;
	And, his corruption being ta'en from us,
	We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all.
	Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know
	In any case the offer of the king.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
	The king will bid you battle presently.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
	There is no seeming mercy in the king.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
	I told him gently of our grievances,
	Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,
	By now forswearing that he is forsworn:
	He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge
	With haughty arms this hateful name in us.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
	The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the king,
	And, nephew, challeng'd you to single fight.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 5><99%>
	What I have done my safety urg'd me to;
	And I embrace this fortune patiently,
	Since not to be avoided it falls on me.
