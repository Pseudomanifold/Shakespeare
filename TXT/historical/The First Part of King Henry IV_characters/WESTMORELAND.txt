	My liege, this haste was hot in question,
	And many limits of the charge set down
	But yesternight; when all athwart there came
	A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;
	Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,
	Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
	Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
	Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
	And a thousand of his people butchered;
	Upon whose dead corpse' there was such misuse,
	Such beastly shameless transformation
	By those Welshwomen done, as may not be
	Without much shame re-told or spoken of.

	This match'd with other like, my gracious lord;
	For more uneven and unwelcome news
	Came from the north and thus it did import:
	On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,
	Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,
	That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
	At Holmedon met,
	Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour;
	As by discharge of their artillery,
	And shape of likelihood, the news was told;
	For he that brought them, in the very heat
	And pride of their contention did take horse,
	Uncertain of the issue any way.

	In faith,
	It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.

	This is his uncle's teaching, this is Worcester,
	Malevolent to you in all aspects;
	Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up
	The crest of youth against your dignity.

	I will, my hege.

	Faith, Sir John, 'tis more than time that I were there, and you too; but my powers are there already. The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must away all night.

	Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor and bare; too beggarly.

	He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 4><93%>
	Come, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent.
