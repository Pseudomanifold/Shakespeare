	Among the crowd i' the Abbey; where a finger
	Could not be wedg'd in more: I am stifled
	With the mere rankness of their joy.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	That I did.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	Well worth the seeing.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	As well as I am able. The rich stream
	Of lords and ladies, having brought the queen
	To a prepar'd place in the choir, fell off
	A distance from her; while her Grace sat down
	To rest awhile, some half an hour or so,
	In a rich chair of state, opposing freely
	The beauty of her person to the people.
	Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman
	That ever lay by man: which when the people
	Had the full view of, such a noise arose
	As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,
	As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks,—
	Doublets, I think,—flew up; and had their faces
	Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy
	I never saw before. Great-bellied women,
	That had not half a week to go, like rams
	In the old time of war, would shake the press,
	And make 'em reel before them. No man living
	Could say, 'This is my wife,' there; all were woven
	So strangely in one piece.

	At length her Grace rose, and with modest paces
	Came to the altar; where she kneel'd, and, saint-like,
	Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly.
	Then rose again and bow'd her to the people:
	When by the Archbishop of Canterbury
	She had all the royal makings of a queen;
	As holy oil, Edward Confessor's crown,
	The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems
	Laid nobly on her: which perform'd, the choir,
	With all the choicest music of the kingdom,
	Together sung Te Deum. So she parted,
	And with the same full state pac'd back again
	To York-place, where the feast is held.

	I know it;
	But 'tis so lately alter'd that the old name
	Is fresh about me.

	Stokesly and Gardiner; the one of Winchester,—
	Newly preferr'd from the king's secretary,—
	The other, London.

	All the land knows that:
	However, yet there's no great breach; when it comes,
	Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.

	Thomas Cromwell:
	A man in much esteem with the king, and truly
	A worthy friend. The king
	Has made him master o' the jewel house,
	And one, already, of the privy-council.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 1><73%>
	Yes, without all doubt.
	Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way, which
	Is to the court, and there ye shall be my guests:
	Something I can command. As I walk thither,
	I'll tell ye more.
