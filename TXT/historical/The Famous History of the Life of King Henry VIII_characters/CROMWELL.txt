	To his own hand, in his bedchamber.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	Presently
	He did unseal them; and the first he view'd,
	He did it with a serious mind; a heed
	Was in his countenance. You he bade
	Attend him here this morning.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	I think, by this he is.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 2><65%>
	I have no power to speak, sir.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 2><65%>
	How does your Grace?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 2><65%>
	I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 2><65%>
	The heaviest and the worst,
	Is your displeasure with the king.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 2><66%>
	The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen
	Lord Chancellor in your place.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 2><66%>
	That Cranmer is return'd with welcome,
	Install'd Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 2><66%>
	Last, that the Lady Anne,
	Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,
	This day was view'd in open, as his queen,
	Going to chapel; and the voice is now
	Only about her coronation.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 2><66%>
	O my lord!
	Must I then, leave you? must I needs forego
	So good, so noble, and so true a master?
	Bear witness all that have not hearts of iron,
	With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.
	The king shall have my service; but my prayers
	For ever and for ever, shall be yours.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 2><68%>
	Good sir, have patience.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 3><87%>
	Please your honours,
	The chief cause concerns his Grace of Canterbury.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
	Yes.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	My Lord of Winchester, you are a little,
	By your good favour, too sharp; men so noble,
	However faulty, yet should find respect
	For what they have been: 'tis a cruelty
	To load a falling man.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	Why, my lord?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	Not sound?
<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	Would you were half so honest!
	Men's prayers then would seek you, not their fears.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	Do.
	Remember your bold life too.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	And I.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	My mind gave me,
	In seeking tales and informations
	Against this man—whose honesty the devil
	And his disciples only envy at—
	Ye blew the fire that burns ye: now have at ye!
