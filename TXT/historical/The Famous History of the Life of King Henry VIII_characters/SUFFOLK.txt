	How is the king employ'd?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	No; his conscience
	Has crept too near another lady.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	Pray God he do! he'll never know himself else.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	And free us from his slavery.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	For me, my lords,
	I love him not, nor fear him; there's my creed.
	As I am made without him, so I'll stand,
	If the king please; his curses and his blessings
	Touch me alike, they're breath I not believe in.
	I knew him, and I know him; so I leave him
	To him that made him proud, the pope.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	How sad he looks! sure, he is much afflicted.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
	</STAGE DIR> Not to speak of;
	I would not be so sick though for his place:
	But this cannot continue.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	Which of the peers
	Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least
	Strangely neglected? when did he regard
	The stamp of nobleness in any person,
	Out of himself?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	Most strangely.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	The cardinal's letter to the pope miscarried,
	And came to the eye o' the king; wherein was read,
	That the cardinal did entreat his holiness
	To stay the judgment o' the divorce; for if
	It did take place, 'I do,' quoth he, 'perceive
	My king is tangled in affection to
	A creature of the queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	Believe it.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	May you be happy in your wish, my lord!
	For I profess, you have it.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	My amen to't!
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	There's order given for her coronation:
	Marry, this is yet but young, and may be left
	To some ears unrecounted. But, my lords,
	She is a gallant creature, and complete
	In mind and feature: I persuade me, from her
	Will fall some blessing to this land, which shall
	In it be memoriz'd.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	No, no;
	There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose
	Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius
	Is stol'n away to Rome; hath ta'en no leave;
	Has left the cause o' the king unhandled; and
	Is posted, as the agent of our cardinal,
	To second all his plot. I do assure you
	The king cried Ha! at this.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	He is return'd in his opinions, which
	Have satisfied the king for his divorce,
	Together with all famous colleges
	Almost in Christendom. Shortly, I believe,
	His second marriage shall be publish'd, and
	Her coronation. Katharine no more
	Shall be call'd queen, but princess dowager,
	And widow to Prince Arthur.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	He has; and we shall see him
	For it an archbishop.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	'Tis so.
	The cardinal!
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
	May be he hears the king
	Does whet his anger to him.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
	The king, the king!
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 2><60%>
	Who dare cross 'em,
	Bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly?
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 2><63%>
	Then, that without the knowledge
	Either of king or council, when you went
	Ambassador to the emperor, you made bold
	To carry into Flanders the great seal.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 2><63%>
	That, out of mere ambition, you have caus'd
	Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 2><64%>
	Lord Cardinal, the king's further pleasure is,
	Because all those things you have done of late,
	By your power legatine, within this kingdom,
	Fall into the compass of a pr√¶munire,
	That therefore such a writ be su'd against you;
	To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,
	Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be
	Out of the king's protection. This is my charge.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
	Sir, I did never win of you before.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	God safely quit her of her burden, and
	With gentle travail, to the gladding of
	Your highness with an heir!
<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	I wish your highness
	A quiet night; and my good mistress will
	Remember in my prayers.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	Nay, my lord,
	That cannot be: you are a counsellor,
	And by that virtue no man dare accuse you.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	'Tis the right ring, by heaven! I told ye all,
	When we first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,
	'Twould fall upon ourselves.
