	Was he mad, sir?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 4><20%>
	You are a merry gamester,
	My Lord Sands.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 4><21%>
	You cannot show me.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	Not for that neither: here's the pang that pinches:
	His highness having liv'd so long with her, and she
	So good a lady that no tongue could ever
	Pronounce dishonour of her; by my life,
	She never knew harm-doing; O! now, after
	So many courses of the sun enthron'd,
	Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which
	To leave a thousand-fold more bitter than
	'Tis sweet at first to acquire, after this process
	To give her the avaunt! it is a pity
	Would move a monster.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	O! God's will; much better
	She ne'er had known pomp: though 't be temporal,
	Yet, if that quarrel, Fortune, do divorce
	It from the bearer, 'tis a sufferance panging
	As soul and body's severing.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	So much the more
	Must pity drop upon her. Verily,
	I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born,
	And range with humble livers in content,
	Than to be perk'd up in a glist'ring grief
	And wear a golden sorrow.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	By my troth and maidenhead
	I would not be a queen.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	Nay, good troth.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	No, not for all the riches under heaven.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	No, in truth.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	How you do talk!
	I swear again, I would not be a queen
	For all the world.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	My good lord,
	Not your demand; it values not your asking:
	Our mistress' sorrows we were pitying.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	Now, I pray God, amen!
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	I do not know
	What kind of my obedience I should tender;
	More than my all is nothing, nor my prayers
	Are not words duly hallow'd, nor my wishes
	More worth than empty vanities; yet prayers and wishes
	Are all I can return. Beseech your lordship,
	Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,
	As from a blushing handmaid, to his highness,
	Whose health and royalty I pray for.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	My honour'd lord.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	This is strange to me.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	Come, you are pleasant.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	Good lady,
	Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy,
	And leave me out on't. Would I had no being,
	If this salute my blood a jot: it faints me,
	To think what follows.
	The queen is comfortless, and we forgetful
	In our long absence. Pray, do not deliver
	What here you've heard to her.
