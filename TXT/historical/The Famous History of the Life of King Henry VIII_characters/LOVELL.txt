	Faith, my lord,
	I hear of none, but the new proclamation
	That's clapp'd upon the court-gate.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	The reformation of our travell'd gallants,
	That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	They must either—
	For so run the conditions—leave those remnants
	Of fool and feather that they got in France,
	With all their honourable points of ignorance
	Pertaining thereunto,—as fights and fireworks;
	Abusing better men than they can be,
	Out of a foreign wisdom;—renouncing clean
	The faith they have in tennis and tall stockings,
	Short blister'd breeches, and those types of travel,
	And understand again like honest men;
	Or pack to their old playfellows: there, I take it,
	They may, cum privilegio, wear away
	The lag end of their lewdness, and be laugh'd at.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
	Ay, marry,
	There will be woe indeed, lords: the sly whoresons
	Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies;
	A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	To the cardinal's:
	Your lordship is a guest too.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed,
	A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;
	His dews fall everywhere.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 4><19%>
	O! that your lordship were but now confessor
	To one or two of these!
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 4><19%>
	Faith, how easy?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 4><23%>
	Yes, my lord.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	I do beseech your Grace, for charity,
	If ever any malice in your heart
	Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	To the water side I must conduct your Grace;
	Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,
	Who undertakes you to your end.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
	Came you from the king, my lord?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
	I must to him too,
	Before he go to bed. I'll take my leave.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
	My lord, I love you,
	And durst commend a secret to your ear
	Much weightier than this work. The queen's in labour,
	They say, in great extremity; and fear'd
	She'll with the labour end.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
	Methinks I could
	Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says
	She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does
	Deserve our better wishes.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
	Now, sir, you speak of two
	The most remark'd i' the kingdom. As for Cromwell,
	Beside that of the jewel-house, is made master
	O' the rolls, and the king's secretary; further, sir,
	Stands in the gap and trade of moe preferments,
	With which the time will load him. The archbishop
	Is the king's hand and tongue; and who dare speak
	One syllable against him?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
	Many good-nights, my lord. I rest your servant.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	I could not personally deliver to her
	What you commanded me, but by her woman
	I sent your message; who return'd her thanks
	In the great'st humbleness, and desir'd your highness
	Most heartily to pray for her.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	So said her woman; and that her sufferance made
	Almost each pang a death.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
	</STAGE DIR> This is about that which the bishop spake:
	I am happily come hither.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	Sir!
