	First, it was usual with him, every day
	It would infect his speech, that if the king
	Should without issue die, he'd carry it so
	To make the sceptre his. These very words
	I've heard him utter to his son-in-law,
	Lord Abergavenny, to whom by oath he menac'd
	Revenge upon the cardinal.

	He was brought to this
	By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins.

	Sir, a Chartreux friar,

	Not long before your highness sped to France,
	The duke being at the Rose, within the parish
	Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand
	What was the speech among the Londoners
	Concerning the French journey: I replied,
	Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious,
	To the king's danger. Presently the duke
	Said, 'twas the fear, indeed; and that he doubted
	'Twould prove the verity of certain words
	Spoke by a holy monk; 'that oft,' says he,
	'Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit
	John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour
	To hear from him a matter of some moment:
	Whom after under the confession's seal
	He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke,
	My chaplain to no creature living but
	To me should utter, with demure confidence
	This pausingly ensu'd: neither the king nor 's heirs—
	Tell you the duke—shall prosper: bid him strive
	To gain the love o' the commonalty: the duke
	Shall govern England.'
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><15%>
	On my soul, I'll speak but truth.
	I told my lord the duke, by the devil's illusions
	The monk might be deceiv'd; and that 'twas dangerous for him
	To ruminate on this so far, until
	It forg'd him some design, which, being believ'd,
	It was much like to do. He answer'd, 'Tush!
	It can do me no damage;' adding further,
	That had the king in his last sickness fail'd,
	The cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads
	Should have gone off.

	Being at Greenwich,
	After your highness had reprov'd the duke
	About Sir William Blomer,—

	'If,' quoth he, 'I for this had been committed,
	As, to the Tower, I thought, I would have play'd
	The part my father meant to act upon
	The usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury,
	Made suit to come in 's presence; which if granted,
	As he made semblance of his duty, would
	Have put his knife into him.'
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 2><16%>
	After 'the duke his father,' with 'the knife,'
	He stretch'd him, and, with one hand on his dagger,
	Another spread on's breast, mounting his eyes,
	He did discharge a horrible oath; whose tenour
	Was, were he evil us'd, he would outgo
	His father by as much as a performance
	Does an irresolute purpose.
