	My life itself, and the best heart of it,
	Thanks you for this great care: I stood i' the level

	To you that chok'd it. Let be call'd before us
	That gentleman of Buckingham's; in person

	Things done well,

	Of this commission? I believe, not any.
	We must not rend our subjects from our laws,
	And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?
	A trembling contribution! Why, we take
	From every tree, lop, bark, and part o' the timber;
	And, though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,
	The air will drink the sap. To every county
	Where this is question'd, send our letters, with
	Free pardon to each man that has denied
	The force of this commission. Pray, look to 't;
	I put it to your care.

	It grieves many:
	The gentleman is learn'd, and a most rare speaker,
	To nature none more bound; his training such
	That he may furnish and instruct great teachers,
	And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,
	When these so noble benefits shall prove
	Not well dispos'd, the mind growing once corrupt,
	They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly
	Than ever they were fair. This man so complete,
	Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders, and when we,
	Almost with ravish'd listening, could not find
	His hour of speech a minute; he, my lady,
	Hath into monstrous habits put the graces
	That once were his, and is become as black
	As if besmear'd in hell. Sit by us; you shall hear—
	This was his gentleman in trust—of him

	Thy meekness saint-like, wife-like government,
	Obeying in commanding, and thy parts
	Sovereign and pious else, could speak thee out,—
	The queen of earthly queens. She's noble born;
	And, like her true nobility, she has
	Carried herself towards me.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 4><44%>
	My Lord Cardinal,
	I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,
	I free you from't. You are not to be taught
	That you have many enemies, that know not
	Why they are so, but, like to village curs,
	Bark when their fellows do: by some of these
	The queen is put in anger. You're excus'd:
	But will you be more justified? you ever
	Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never
	Desir'd it to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,
	The passages made toward it. On my honour,
	I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point,
	And thus far clear him. Now, what mov'd me to't,
	I will be bold with time and your attention:
	Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:
	My conscience first receiv'd a tenderness,
	Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd
	By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador,
	Who had been hither sent on the debating
	A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and
	Our daughter Mary. I' the progress of this business,
	Ere a determinate resolution, he—
	I mean, the bishop—did require a respite;
	Wherein he might the king his lord advertise
	Whether our daughter were legitimate,
	Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,
	Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook
	The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,
	Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble
	The region of my breast; which forc'd such way,
	That many maz'd considerings did throng,
	And press'd in with this caution. First, methought
	I stood not in the smile of heaven, who had
	Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,
	If it conceiv'd a male child by me, should
	Do no more offices of life to't than
	The grave does to the dead; for her male issue
	Or died where they were made, or shortly after
	This world had air'd them. Hence I took a thought
	This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,
	Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not
	Be gladded in't by me. Then follows that
	I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in
	By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me
	Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in
	The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer
	Toward this remedy, whereupon we are
	Now present here together; that's to say,
	I meant to rectify my conscience, which
	I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,
	By all the rev'rend fathers of the land
	And doctors learn'd. First, I began in private
	With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember
	How under my oppression I did reek,
	When I first mov'd you.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 2><SCENE 4><45%>
	I have spoke long: be pleas'd yourself to say
	How far you satisfied me.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 4><46%>
	Then I mov'd you,
	My Lord of Canterbury, and got your leave
	To make this present summons. Unsolicited
	I left no reverend person in this court;
	But by particular consent proceeded
	Under your hands and seals: therefore, go on;
	For no dislike i' the world against the person
	Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points
	Of my alleged reasons drive this forward.
	Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life
	And kingly dignity, we are contented
	To wear our mortal state to come with her,
	Katharine our queen, before the primest creature
	That's paragon'd o' the world.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 4><46%>
	</STAGE DIR> I may perceive
	These cardinals trifle with me: I abhor
	This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.
	My learn'd and well-beloved servant Cranmer,
	Prithee, return: with thy approach, I know,
	My comfort comes along. Break up the court:
	I say, set on.

	What piles of wealth hath he accumulated
	To his own portion! and what expense by the hour
	Seems to flow from him! How, i' the name of thrift,
	Does he rake this together? Now, my lords,
	Saw you the cardinal?
<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	It may well be:
	There is a mutiny in 's mind. This morning
	Papers of state he sent me to peruse,
	As I requir'd; and wot you what I found
	There, on my conscience, put unwittingly?
	Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing;
	The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,
	Rich stuffs and ornaments of household, which
	I find at such a proud rate that it out-speaks
	Possession of a subject.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	If we did think
	His contemplation were above the earth,
	And fix'd on spiritual object, he should still
	Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid
	His thinkings are below the moon, not worth
	His serious considering.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	Good my lord,
	You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory
	Of your best graces in your mind, the which
	You were now running o'er: you have scarce time
	To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span
	To keep your earthly audit: sure, in that
	I deem you an ill husband, and am glad
	To have you therein my companion.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	You have said well.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	'Tis well said again;
	And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well:
	And yet words are no deeds. My father lov'd you:
	He said he did; and with his deed did crown
	His word upon you. Since I had my office,
	I have kept you next my heart; have not alone
	Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
	But par'd my present havings, to bestow
	My bounties upon you.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	Have I not made you
	The prime man of the state? I pray you, tell me
	If what I now pronounce you have found true;
	And if you may confess it, say withal,
	If you are bound to us or no. What say you?
<SPEECH 50><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
	Fairly answer'd;
	A loyal and obedient subject is
	Therein illustrated; the honour of it
	Does pay the act of it, as, i' the contrary,
	The foulness is the punishment. I presume
	That as my hand has open'd bounty to you,
	My heart dropp'd love, my power rain'd honour, more
	On you than any; so your hand and heart,
	Your brain, and every function of your power,
	Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,
	As 'twere in love's particular, be more
	To me, your friend, than any.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
	'Tis nobly spoken.
	Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,
	For you have seen him open't. Read o'er this;
	And after, this: and then to breakfast with
	What appetite you have.

	Come, you and I must walk a turn together;
	I have news to tell you: come, come, give me your hand.
	Ah! my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,
	And am right sorry to repeat what follows.
	I have, and most unwillingly, of late
	Heard many grievous, I do say, my lord,
	Grievous complaints of you; which, being consider'd,
	Have mov'd us and our council, that you shall
	This morning come before us; where, I know,
	You cannot with such freedom purge yourself,
	But that, till further trial in those charges
	Which will require your answer, you must take
	Your patience to you, and be well contented
	To make your house our Tower: you a brother of us,
	It fits we thus proceed, or else no witness
	Would come against you.
<SPEECH 64><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
	Stand up, good Canterbury:
	Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted
	In us, thy friend: give me thy hand, stand up:
	Prithee, let's walk. Now, by my holidame,
	What manner of man are you? My lord, I look'd
	You would have given me your petition, that
	I should have ta'en some pains to bring together
	Yourself and your accusers; and to have heard you,
	Without indurance, further.
<SPEECH 65><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	Know you not
	How your state stands i' the world, with the whole world?
	Your enemies are many, and not small; their practices
	Must bear the same proportion; and not ever

	The due o' the verdict with it. At what ease
	Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt
	To swear against you? such things have been done.
	You are potently oppos'd, and with a malice
	Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,
	I mean in perjur'd witness, than your master,
	Whose minister you are, whiles here he liv'd
	Upon this naughty earth? Go to, go to;
	You take a precipice for no leap of danger,
	And woo your own destruction.
<SPEECH 66><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	Be of good cheer;
	They shall no more prevail than we give way to.
	Keep comfort to you; and this morning see
	You do appear before them. If they shall chance,
	In charging you with matters, to commit you,
	The best persuasions to the contrary
	Fail not to use, and with what vehemency
	The occasion shall instruct you: if entreaties
	Will render you no remedy, this ring
	Deliver them, and your appeal to us
	There make before them. Look! the good man weeps;

	Ha! 'Tis he, indeed:

	They had parted so much honesty among 'em,—
	At least, good manners,—as not thus to suffer
	A man of his place, and so near our favour,
	To dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures,
	And at the door too, like a post with packets.
	By holy Mary, Butts, there's knavery:
	Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close;
	We shall hear more anon.

	You were ever good at sudden commendations,
	Bishop of Winchester; but know, I come not

	And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;
	But, whatsoe'er thou tak'st me for, I'm sure
	Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.
	</STAGE DIR> Good man, sit down. Now let me see the proudest

	By all that's holy, he had better starve

<SPEECH 74><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
	No, sir, it does not please me.
	I had thought I had had men of some understanding

	Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,
	This good man,—few of you deserve that title,—
	This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy
	At chamber-door? and one as great as you are?
	Why, what a shame was this! Did my commission
	Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye
	Power as he was a counsellor to try him,
	Not as a groom. There's some of ye, I see,
	More out of malice than integrity,
	Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean;
	Which ye shall never have while I live.

	Well, well, my lords, respect him;

	Am, for his love and service, so to him.
	Make me no more ado, but all embrace him:
	Be friends, for shame, my lords! My Lord of Canterbury,
	I have a suit which you must not deny me;
	That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism,
	You must be godfather, and answer for her.

	Come, come, my lord, you'd spare your spoons: you shall have two noble partners with you; the old Duchess of Norfolk, and Lady Marquess Dorset: will these please you?

	Good man! those joyful tears show thy true heart:

	Come, lords, we trifle time away; I long

	To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.
	I thank ye all. To you, my good Lord Mayor,
	And your good brethren, I am much beholding;
	I have receiv'd much honour by your presence,
	And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords:
	Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye;
	She will be sick else. This day, no man think
	He has business at his house; for all shall stay:
	This little one shall make it holiday.
	'Tis ten to one, this play can never please
	All that are here: some come to take their ease
	And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear,
	We've frighted with our trumpets; so, 'tis clear
	They'll say 'tis naught: others, to hear the city
	Abus'd extremely, and to cry, 'That's witty!'
	Which we have not done neither: that, I fear,
	All the expected good we're like to hear
	For this play at this time, is only in
	The merciful construction of good women;
	For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile,
	And say 'twill do, I know, within a while
	All the best men are ours; for 'tis ill hap
	If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.
