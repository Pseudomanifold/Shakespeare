	Good morrow, and well met. How have you done,
	Since last we saw in France?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	An untimely ague
	Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber, when
	Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,
	Met in the vale of Andren.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	All the whole time
	I was my chamber's prisoner.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	O! you go far.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Who did guide,
	I mean, who set the body and the limbs
	Of this great sport together, as you guess?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	I pray you, who, my lord?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed
	From his ambitious finger. What had he
	To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder
	That such a keech can with his very bulk
	Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun,
	And keep it from the earth.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Why the devil,
	Upon this French going-out, took he upon him,
	Without the privity o' the king, to appoint
	Who should attend on him? He makes up the file
	Of all the gentry; for the most part such
	To whom as great a charge as little honour
	He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,—
	The honourable board of council out,—
	Must fetch him in he papers.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	O! many
	Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em
	For this great journey. What did this vanity
	But minister communication of
	A most poor issue?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Every man,
	After the hideous storm that follow'd, was
	A thing inspir'd; and, not consulting, broke
	Into a general prophecy: That this tempest,
	Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded
	The sudden breach on't.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Why, all this business
	Our reverend cardinal carried.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I
	Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best
	Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book
	Outworths a noble's blood.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	I read in's looks
	Matter against me; and his eye revil'd
	Me, as his abject object: at this instant
	He bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king;
	I'll follow, and out-stare him.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	I'll to the king;
	And from a mouth of honour quite cry down
	This Ipswich fellow's insolence, or proclaim
	There's difference in no persons.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Sir,
	I am thankful to you, and I'll go along
	By your prescription: but this top-proud fellow
	Whom from the flow of gall I name not, but
	From sincere motions,—by intelligence,
	And proofs as clear as founts in July, when
	We see each grain of gravel,—I do know
	To be corrupt and treasonous.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	To the king I'll say't; and make my vouch as strong
	As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,
	Or wolf, or both,—for he is equal ravenous
	As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief
	As able to perform 't, his mind and place
	Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally,
	Only to show his pomp as well in France
	As here at home, suggests the king our master
	To this last costly treaty, the interview,
	That swallow'd so much treasure, and like a glass
	Did break i' the rinsing.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
	Praygive me favour, sir. This cunning cardinal
	The articles o' the combination drew
	As himself pleas'd; and they were ratified
	As he cried, 'Thus let be,' to as much end
	As give a crutch to the dead. But our count-cardinal
	Has done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,
	Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,—
	Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy
	To the old dam, treason, Charles the emperor,
	Under pretence to see the queen his aunt,—
	For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came
	To whisper Wolsey,—here makes visitation:
	His fears were, that the interview betwixt
	England and France might, through their amity,
	Breed him some prejudice; for from this league
	Peep'd harms that menac'd him. He privily
	Deals with our cardinal, and, as I trow,
	Which I do well; for, I am sure the emperor
	Paid ere he promis'd; whereby his suit was granted
	Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
	And pav'd with gold, the emperor thus desir'd:
	That he would please to alter the king's course,
	And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know—
	As soon he shall by me—that thus the cardinal
	Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,
	And for his own advantage.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	No, not a syllable:
	I do pronounce him in that very shape
	He shall appear in proof.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	Lo you, my lord,
	The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish
	Under device and practice.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	It will help me nothing
	To plead mine innocence, for that dye is on me
	Which makes my whit'st part black. The will of heaven

	O! my Lord Abergavenny, fare you well!
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	So, so;
	These are the limbs o' the plot: no more, I hope.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	O! Nicholas Hopkins?
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	My surveyor is false; the o'er-great cardinal
	Hath show'd him gold. My life is spann'd already:
	I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,
	Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on,
	By dark'ning my clear sun. My lord, farewell.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	All good people,
	You that thus far have come to pity me,
	Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.
	I have this day receiv'd a traitor's judgment,
	And by that name must die: yet, heaven bear witness,
	And if I have a conscience, let it sink me,
	Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!
	The law I bear no malice for my death,
	'T has done upon the premises but justice;
	But those that sought it I could wish more Christians:
	Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em.
	Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief,
	Nor build their evils on the graves of great men;
	For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.
	For further life in this world I ne'er hope,
	Nor will I sue, although the king have mercies
	More than I dare make faults. You few that lov'd me,
	And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,
	His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave
	Is only bitter to him, only dying,
	Go with me, like good angels, to my end;
	And, as the long divorce of steel falls on me,
	Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,
	And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, o' God's name.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you
	As I would be forgiven: I forgive all.
	There cannot be those numberless offences
	'Gainst me that I cannot take peace with: no black envy
	Shall mark my grave. Commend me to his Grace;
	And, if he speak of Buckingham, pray, tell him
	You met him half in heaven. My vows and prayers
	Yet are the king's; and, till my soul forsake,
	Shall cry for blessings on him: may he live
	Longer than I have time to tell his years!
	Ever belov'd and loving may his rule be!
	And when old time shall lead him to his end,
	Goodness and he fill up one monument!
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	Nay, Sir Nicholas,
	Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.
	When I came hither, I was Lord High Constable,
	And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun:
	Yet I am richer than my base accusers,
	That never knew what truth meant: I now seal it;
	And with that blood will make them one day groan for't.
	My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
	Who first rais'd head against usurping Richard,
	Flying for succour to his servant Banister,
	Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd,
	And without trial fell: God's peace be with him!
	Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
	My father's loss, like a most royal prince,
	Restor'd me to my honours, and, out of ruins,
	Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
	Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name, and all
	That made me happy, at one stroke has taken
	For ever from the world. I had my trial,
	And, must needs say, a noble one; which makes me
	A little happier than my wretched father:
	Yet thus far we are one in fortunes; both
	Fell by our servants, by those men welov'd most:
	A most unnatural and faithless service!
	Heaven has an end in all; yet, you that hear me,
	This from a dying man receive as certain:
	Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels
	Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
	And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
	The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
	Like water from ye, never found again
	But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,
	Pray for me! I must now forsake ye: the last hour
	Of my long weary life is come upon me.
	Farewell:
	And when you would say something that is sad,
	Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!
