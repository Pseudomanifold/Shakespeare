	Nay, we must longer kneel: I am a suitor.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	Thank your majesty.
	That you would love yourself, and in that love
	Not unconsider'd leave your honour, nor
	The dignity of your office, is the point
	Of my petition.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	I am solicited, not by a few,
	And those of true condition, that your subjects
	Are in great grievance: there have been commissions
	Sent down among 'em, which hath flaw'd the heart
	Of all their loyalties: wherein, although,
	My good Lord Cardinal, they vent reproaches
	Most bitterly on you, as putter-on
	Of these exactions, yet the king our master,—
	Whose honour heaven shield from soil!—even he escapes not
	Language unmannerly; yea, such which breaks
	The sides of loyalty, and almost appears
	In loud rebellion.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	No, my lord,
	You know no more than others; but you frame
	Things that are known alike; which are not wholesome
	To those which would not know them, and yet must
	Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions,
	Whereof my sov'reign would have note, they are
	Most pestilent to the hearing; and to bear 'em,
	The back is sacrifice to the load. They say
	They are devis'd by you, or else you suffer
	Too hard an exclamation.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	I am much too venturous
	In tempting of your patience; but am bolden'd
	Under your promis'd pardon. The subjects' grief
	Comes through commissions, which compel from each
	The sixth part of his substance, to be levied
	Without delay; and the pretence for this
	Is nam'd, your wars in France. This makes bold mouths:
	Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze
	Allegiance in them; their curses now
	Live where their prayers did; and it's come to pass,
	This tractable obedience is a slave
	To each incensed will. I would your highness
	Would give it quick consideration, for
	There is no primer business.

	I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham
	Is run in your displeasure.

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><15%>
	If I know you well,
	You were the duke's surveyor, and lost your office
	On the complaint o' the tenants: take good heed

	Yes, heartily beseech you.

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	Sir, I desire you do me right and justice;
	And to bestow your pity on me; for
	I am a most poor woman, and a stranger,
	Born out of your dominions; having here
	No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance
	Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas! sir,
	In what have I offended you? what cause
	Hath my behaviour given to your displeasure,
	That thus you should proceed to put me off
	And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,
	I have been to you a true and humble wife,
	At all times to your will conformable;
	Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
	Yea, subject to your countenance, glad or sorry
	As I saw it inclin'd. When was the hour
	I ever contradicted your desire,
	Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends
	Have I not strove to love, although I knew
	He were mine enemy? what friend of mine
	That had to him deriv'd your anger, did I
	Continue in my liking? nay, gave notice
	He was from thence discharg'd. Sir, call to mind
	That I have been your wife, in this obedience
	Upward of twenty years, and have been blest
	With many children by you: if, in the course
	And process of this time, you can report,
	And prove it too, against mine honour aught,
	My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty,
	Against your sacred person, in God's name
	Turn me away; and let the foul'st contempt
	Shut door upon me, and so give me up
	To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you, sir,
	The king, your father, was reputed for
	A prince most prudent, of an excellent
	And unmatch'd wit and judgment: Ferdinand,
	My father, King of Spain, was reckon'd one
	The wisest prince that there had reign'd by many
	A year before: it is not to be question'd
	That they had gather'd a wise council to them
	Of every realm, that did debate this business,
	Who deem'd our marriage lawful. Wherefore I humbly
	Beseech you, sir, to spare me, till I may
	Be by my friends in Spain advis'd, whose counsel
	I will implore: if not, i' the name of God,
	Your pleasure be fulfill'd!
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 4><41%>
	Lord Cardinal,
	To you I speak.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 4><41%>
	Sir,
	I am about to weep; but, thinking that
	We are a queen,—or long have dream'd so,—certain
	The daughter of a king, my drops of tears
	I'll turn to sparks of fire.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 4><41%>
	I will, when you are humble; nay, before,
	Or God will punish me. I do believe,
	Induc'd by potent circumstances, that
	You are mine enemy; and make my challenge
	You shall not be my judge; for it is you
	Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me,
	Which God's dew quench! Therefore I say again,
	I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul
	Refuse you for my judge, whom, yet once more,
	I hold my most malicious foe, and think not
	At all a friend to truth.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 4><42%>
	My lord, my lord,
	I am a simple woman, much too weak
	To oppose your cunning. You're meek and humble-mouth'd;
	You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,
	With meekness and humility; but your heart
	Is cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.
	You have, by fortune and his highness' favours,
	Gone slightly o'er low steps, and now are mounted
	Where powers are your retainers, and your words,
	Domestics to you, serve your will as't please
	Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,
	You tender more your person's honour than
	Your high profession spiritual; that again
	I do refuse you for my judge; and here,
	Before you all, appeal unto the pope,
	To bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness,
	And to be judg'd by him.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 4><43%>
	What need you note it? pray you, keep your way:
	When you are call'd, return. Now, the Lord help!
	They vex me past my patience. Pray you, pass on:
	I will not tarry; no, nor ever more
	Upon this business my appearance make
	In any of their courts.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Take thy lute, wench: my soul grows sad with troubles;
	Sing and disperse 'em, if thou canst. Leave working.
	Orpheus with his lute made trees,
	And the mountain tops that freeze,
	Bow themselves, when he did sing:
	To his music plants and flowers
	Ever sprung; as sun and showers
	There had made a lasting spring.
	Every thing that heard him play,
	Even the billows of the sea,
	Hung their heads, and then lay by.
	In sweet music is such art,

<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Speak it here;
	There's nothing I have done yet, o' my conscience,
	Deserves a corner: would all other women

	My lords, I care not—so much I am happy
	Above a number—if my actions
	Were tried by every tongue, every eye saw 'em,
	Envy and base opinion set against 'em,
	I know my life so even. If your business
	Seek me out, and that way I am wife in,
	Out with it boldly: truth loves open dealing.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	O, good my lord, no Latin;
	I am not such a truant since my coming
	As not to know the language I have liv'd in:
	A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious;
	Pray, speak in English: here are some will thank you,
	If you speak truth, for their poor mistress' sake:
	Believe me, she has had much wrong. Lord Cardinal,
	The willing'st sin I ever yet committed
	May be absolv'd in English.

	</STAGE DIR> To betray me.
	My lords, I thank you both for your good wills;
	Ye speak like honest men,—pray God, ye prove so!—
	But how to make ye suddenly an answer,
	In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,—
	More near my life, I fear,—with my weak wit,
	And to such men of gravity and learning,
	In truth, I know not. I was set at work
	Among my maids; full little, God knows, looking
	Either for such men or such business.
	For her sake that I have been,—for I feel
	The last fit of my greatness,—good your Graces
	Let me have time and counsel for my cause:
	Alas! I am a woman, friendless, hopeless.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	In England
	But little for my profit. Can you think, lords,
	That any Englishman dare give me counsel?
	Or be a known friend, 'gainst his highness' pleasure,—
	Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,—
	And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,
	They that must weigh out my afflictions,
	They that my trust must grow to, live not here:
	They are, as all my other comforts, far hence
	In mine own country, lords.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	How, sir?
<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	Ye tell me what ye wish for both; my ruin.

<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	The more shame for ye! holy men I thought ye,
	Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;
	But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye.
	Mend 'em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?
	The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,
	A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?
	I will not wish ye half my miseries,
	I have more charity; but say, I warn'd ye:
	Take heed, for heaven's sake, take heed, lest at once
	The burden of my sorrows fall upon ye.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon ye,
	And all such false professors! Would ye have me,—

	If ye be anything but churchmen's habits,—
	Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?
	Alas! he has banish'd me his bed already,
	His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords,
	And all the fellowship I hold now with him
	Is only my obedience. What can happen
	To me above this wretchedness? all your studies
	Make me a curse like this.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	Have I liv'd thus long—let me speak myself,
	Since virtue finds no friends—a wife, a true one?
	A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,
	Never yet branded with suspicion?

	Still met the king? lov'd him next heaven? obey'd him?
	Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?
	Almost forgot my prayers to content him?
	And am I thus rewarded? 'tis not well, lords.
	Bring me a constant woman to her husband,
	One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure,
	And to that woman, when she has done most,
	Yet will I add an honour, a great patience.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,

	</STAGE DIR> Alas! poor wenches, where are now your fortunes?
	Shipwrack'd upon a kingdom, where no pity,
	No friends, no hope; no kindred weep for me;

	Pray do my service to his majesty:
	He has my heart yet; and shall have my prayers
	While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,
	Bestow your counsels on me: she now begs

	She should have bought her dignities so dear.

	O Griffith! sick to death!

	That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey,
	Was dead?

	Alas! poor man.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
	So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!
	Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,
	And yet with charity. He was a man
	Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking
	Himself with princes; one, that by suggestion
	Tied all the kingdom; simony was fair-play;
	His own opinion was his law; i' the presence
	He would say untruths, and be ever double
	Both in his words and meaning. He was never,
	But where he meant to ruin, pitiful;
	His promises were, as he then was, mighty;
	But his performance, as he is now, nothing:
	Of his own body he was ill, and gave
	The clergy ill example.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
	Yes, good Griffith,
	I were malicious else.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 2><75%>
	After my death I wish no other herald,
	No other speaker of my living actions,
	To keep mine honour from corruption,
	But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.
	Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,
	With thy religious truth and modesty,
	Now in his ashes honour. Peace be with him!
	Patience, be near me still; and set me lower:
	I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,
	Cause the musicians play me that sad note
	I nam'd my knell, whilst I sit meditating
	On that celestial harmony I go to.

<SPEECH 46><ACT 4><SCENE 2><78%>
	O! my good lord, that comfort comes too late;
	'Tis like a pardon after execution:

	But now I am past all comforts here but prayers.
	How does his highness?
<SPEECH 47><ACT 4><SCENE 2><78%>
	So may he ever do! and ever flourish,
	When I shall dwell with worms, and my poor name

	I caus'd you write, yet sent away?
<SPEECH 48><ACT 4><SCENE 2><78%>
	Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver
	This to my lord the king.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 4><SCENE 2><78%>
	In which I have commended to his goodness
	The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter:
	The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!
	Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding,—
	She is young, and of a noble modest nature,
	I hope she will deserve well,—and a little
	To love her for her mother's sake, that lov'd him,
	Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition
	Is, that his noble Grace would have some pity
	Upon my wretched women, that so long
	Have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully:
	Of which there is not one, I dare avow,—
	And now I should not lie,—but will deserve,
	For virtue, and true beauty of the soul,
	For honesty and decent carriage,
	A right good husband, let him be a noble;
	And, sure, those men are happy that shall have 'em.
	The last is, for my men: they are the poorest,
	But poverty could never draw 'em from me;
	That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,
	And something over to remember me by:
	If heaven had pleas'd to have given me longer life
	And able means, we had not parted thus.
	These are the whole contents: and, good my lord,
	By that you love the dearest in this world,
	As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,
	Stand these poor people's friend, and urge the king
	To do me this last right.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 4><SCENE 2><79%>
	I thank you, honest lord. Remember me
	In all humility unto his highness:
	Say his long trouble now is passing
	Out of this world; tell him, in death I bless'd him;
	For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,
	My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,
	You must not leave me yet: I must to bed;
	Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,
	Let me be us'd with honour: strew me over
	With maiden flowers, that all the world may know
	I was a chaste wife to my grave: embalm me,
	Then lay me forth: although unqueen'd, yet like
	A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.
	I can no more.
