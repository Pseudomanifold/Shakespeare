	Noble lady,
	First, mine own service to your Grace; the next,
	The king's request that I would visit you;
	Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me
	Sends you his princely commendations,
	And heartily entreats you take good comfort.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 2><78%>
	Madam, in good health.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 2><78%>
	Most willing, madam.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 2><79%>
	By heaven, I will,
	Or let me lose the fashion of a man!
