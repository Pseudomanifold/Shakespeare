<ACT 1>


<SCENE 1>
<London. A Room in the Palace.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter King Richard, attended; John of Gaunt, and other Nobles.>
</STAGE DIR>
<K. RICHARD>	<0%>
	Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,
	Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,
	Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,
	Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,
	Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
	Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
</K. RICHARD>

<GAUNT>	<1%>
	I have, my liege.
</GAUNT>

<K. RICHARD>	<1%>
	Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,
	If he appeal the duke on ancient malice,
	Or worthily, as a good subject should,
	On some known ground of treachery in him?
</K. RICHARD>

<GAUNT>	<1%>
	As near as I could sift him on that argument,
	On some apparent danger seen in him
	Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.
</GAUNT>

<K. RICHARD>	<1%>
	Then call them to our presence: face to face,
	And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear
	The accuser and the accused freely speak:
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt some Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
	High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
	In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.

</K. RICHARD>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Attendants, with Bolingbroke and Mowbray.>
</STAGE DIR>
<BOLINGBROKE>	<1%>
	Many years of happy days befall
	My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!
</BOLINGBROKE>

<MOWBRAY>	<1%>
	Each day still better other's happiness;
	Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,
	Add an immortal title to your crown!
</MOWBRAY>

<K. RICHARD>	<1%>
	We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
	As well appeareth by the cause you come;
	Namely, to appeal each other of high treason.
	Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object
	Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
</K. RICHARD>

<BOLINGBROKE>	<1%>
	First,—heaven be the record to my speech!—
	In the devotion of a subject's love,
	Tendering the precious safety of my prince,
	And free from other misbegotten hate,
	Come I appellant to this princely presence.
	Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
	And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
	My body shall make good upon this earth,
	Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.
	Thou art a traitor and a miscreant;
	Too good to be so and too bad to live,
	Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
	The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
	Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
	With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
	And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,
	What my tongue speaks, my right drawn sword may prove.
</BOLINGBROKE>

<MOWBRAY>	<2%>
	Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
	'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
	The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
	Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;
	The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:
	Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
	As to be hush'd and nought at all to say.
	First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
	From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;
	Which else would post until it had return'd
	These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
	Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
	And let him be no kinsman to my liege,
	I do defy him, and I spit at him;
	Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
	Which to maintain I would allow him odds,
	And meet him, were I tied to run afoot
	Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,
	Or any other ground inhabitable,
	Wherever Englishman durst set his foot.
	Meantime let this defend my loyalty:
	By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.
</MOWBRAY>

<BOLINGBROKE>	<3%>
	Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,
	Disclaiming here the kindred of the king;
	And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
	Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except:
	If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
	As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
	By that, and all the rites of knighthood else,
	Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
	What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.
</BOLINGBROKE>

<MOWBRAY>	<3%>
	I take it up; and by that sword I swear,
	Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,
	I'll answer thee in any fair degree,
	Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:
	And when I mount, alive may I not light,
	If I be traitor or unjustly fight!
</MOWBRAY>

<K. RICHARD>	<3%>
	What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
	It must be great that can inherit us
	So much as of a thought of ill in him.
</K. RICHARD>

<BOLINGBROKE>	<3%>
	Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;
	That Mowbray hath receiv'd eight thousand nobles
	In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,
	The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,
	Like a false traitor and injurious villain.
	Besides I say and will in battle prove,
	Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
	That ever was survey'd by English eye,
	That all the treasons for these eighteen years
	Complotted and contrived in this land,
	Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
	Further I say and further will maintain
	Upon his bad life to make all this good,
	That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
	Suggest his soon believing adversaries,
	And consequently, like a traitor coward,
	Sluic'd out his innocent soul through streams of blood:
	Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
	Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,
	To me for justice and rough chastisement;
	And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
	This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.
</BOLINGBROKE>

<K. RICHARD>	<4%>
	How high a pitch his resolution soars!
	Thomas of Norfolk, what sayst thou to this?
</K. RICHARD>

<MOWBRAY>	<4%>
	O! let my sovereign turn away his face
	And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
	Till I have told this slander of his blood
	How God and good men hate so foul a liar.
</MOWBRAY>

<K. RICHARD>	<4%>
	Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:
	Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,—
	As he is but my father's brother's son,—
	Now, by my sceptre's awe I make a vow,
	Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
	Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize
	The unstooping firmness of my upright soul.
	He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:
	Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.
</K. RICHARD>

<MOWBRAY>	<5%>
	Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
	Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.
	Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
	Disburs'd I duly to his highness' soldiers;
	The other part reserv'd I by consent,
	For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
	Upon remainder of a dear account,
	Since last I went to France to fetch his queen.
	Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,
	I slew him not; but to mine own disgrace
	Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
	For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,
	The honourable father to my foe,
	Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
	A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;
	But ere I last receiv'd the sacrament
	I did confess it, and exactly begg'd
	Your Grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.
	This is my fault: as for the rest appeal'd,
	It issues from the rancour of a villain,
	A recreant and most degenerate traitor;
	Which in myself I boldly will defend,
	And interchangeably hurl down my gage
	Upon this overweening traitor's foot,
	To prove myself a loyal gentleman
	Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.
	In haste whereof, most heartily I pray
	Your highness to assign our trial day.
</MOWBRAY>

<K. RICHARD>	<5%>
	Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be rul'd by me;
	Let's purge this choler without letting blood:
	This we prescribe, though no physician;
	Deep malice makes too deep incision:
	Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed,
	Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.
	Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
	We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.
</K. RICHARD>

<GAUNT>	<6%>
	To be a make-peace shall become my age:
	Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.
</GAUNT>

<K. RICHARD>	<6%>
	And, Norfolk, throw down his.
</K. RICHARD>

<GAUNT>	<6%>
	When, Harry, when?
	Obedience bids I should not bid again.
</GAUNT>

<K. RICHARD>	<6%>
	Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.
</K. RICHARD>

<MOWBRAY>	<6%>
	Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.
	My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:
	The one my duty owes; but my fair name,—
	Despite of death that lives upon my grave,—
	To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.
	I am disgrac'd, impeach'd, and baffled here,
	Pierc'd to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,
	The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood
	Which breath'd this poison.
</MOWBRAY>

<K. RICHARD>	<6%>
	Rage must be withstood:
	Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.
</K. RICHARD>

<MOWBRAY>	<6%>
	Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame,
	And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,
	The purest treasure mortal times afford
	Is spotless reputation; that away,
	Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
	A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest
	Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.
	Mine honour is my life; both grow in one;
	Take honour from me, and my life is done:
	Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;
	In that I live and for that will I die.
</MOWBRAY>

<K. RICHARD>	<7%>
	Cousin, throw down your gage: do you begin.
</K. RICHARD>

<BOLINGBROKE>	<7%>
	O! God defend my soul from such deep sin.
	Shall I seem crest fall'n in my father's sight,
	Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
	Before this out-dar'd dastard? Ere my tongue
	Shall wound mine honour with such feeble wrong,
	Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
	The slavish motive of recanting fear,
	And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
	Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.
</BOLINGBROKE>

<Exit Gaunt.>

<K. RICHARD>	<7%>
	We were not born to sue, but to command:
	Which since we cannot do to make you friends,
	Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,
	At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:
	There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
	The swelling difference of your settled hate:
	Since we cannot atone you, we shall see
	Justice design the victor's chivalry.
	Marshal, command our officers-at-arms
	Be ready to direct these home alarms.

<SCENE 2>
<The Same. A Room in the Duke of Lancaster's Palace.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Gaunt and Duchess of Gloucester.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GAUNT>	<7%>
	Alas! the part I had in Woodstock's blood
	Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,
	To stir against the butchers of his life.
	But since correction lieth in those hands
	Which made the fault that we cannot correct,
	Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;
	Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,
	Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.
</GAUNT>

<DUCHESS>	<8%>
	Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
	Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
	Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,
	Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,
	Or seven fair branches springing from one root:
	Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,
	Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;
	But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,
	One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,
	One flourishing branch of his most royal root,
	Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt;
	Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all vaded,
	By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.
	Ah, Gaunt! his blood was thine: that bed, that womb,
	That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee
	Made him a man; and though thou liv'st and breath'st,
	Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent
	In some large measure to thy father's death
	In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
	Who was the model of thy father's life.
	Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
	In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd
	Thou show'st the naked pathway to thy life,
	Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:
	That which in mean men we entitle patience
	Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
	What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,
	The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.
</DUCHESS>

<GAUNT>	<9%>
	God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,
	His deputy anointed in his sight,
	Hath caus'd his death; the which if wrongfully,
	Let heaven revenge, for I may never lift
	An angry arm against his minister.
</GAUNT>

<DUCHESS>	<9%>
	Where then, alas! may I complain myself?
</DUCHESS>

<GAUNT>	<9%>
	To God, the widow's champion and defence.
</GAUNT>

<DUCHESS>	<9%>
	Why then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.
	Thou go'st to Coventry, there to behold
	Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:
	O! sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,
	That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast.
	Or if misfortune miss the first career,
	Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom
	That they may break his foaming courser's back,
	And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
	A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
	Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife
	With her companion grief must end her life.
</DUCHESS>

<GAUNT>	<9%>
	Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry.
	As much good stay with thee as go with me!
</GAUNT>

<DUCHESS>	<9%>
	Yet one word more. Grief boundeth where it falls,
	Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:
	I take my leave before I have begun,
	For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
	Commend me to my brother, Edmund York.
	Lo! this is all: nay, yet depart not so;
	Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
	I shall remember more. Bid him—ah, what?—
	With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
	Alack! and what shall good old York there see
	But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
	Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
	And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
	Therefore commend me; let him not come there,
	To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
	Desolate, desolate will I hence, and die:
	The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.

	For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd
	With that dear blood which it hath fostered;
	And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
	Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' swords;
	And for we think the eagle-winged pride
	Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,
	With rival-hating envy, set on you
	To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle
	Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;
	Which so rous'd up with boist'rous untun'd drums,
	With harsh-resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,
	And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,
	Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
	And make us wade even in our kindred's blood:
	Therefore, we banish you our territories:

	A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,
	And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth:

	As to be cast forth in the common air,
	Have I deserved at your highness' hands.
	The language I have learn'd these forty years,
	My native English, now I must forego;
	And now my tongue's use is to me no more
	Than an unstringed viol or a harp,
	Or like a cunning instrument cas'd up,
	Or, being open, put into his hands
	That knows no touch to tune the harmony:
	Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,
	Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;
	And dull, unfeeling, barren ignorance
	Is made my gaoler to attend on me.
	I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,
	Too far in years to be a pupil now:
	What is thy sentence then but speechless death,
	Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?

	You never shall,—so help you truth and God!—

	How he did seem to dive into their hearts
	With humble and familiar courtesy,
	What reverence he did throw away on slaves,
	Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles

	Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;
	A brace of draymen bid God speed him well,

	For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.
	He that no more must say is listen'd more
	Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;
	More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:
	The setting sun, and music at the close,
	As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,
	Writ in remembrance more than things long past:
	Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,
	My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.

	Whose manners still our tardy apish nation
	Limps after in base imitation.
	Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity,—
	So it be new there's no respect how vile,—
	That is not quickly buzz'd into his ears?
	Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,

	Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
	He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
	With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:
	Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
	Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
	This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,
	This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
	This other Eden, demi-paradise,
	This fortress built by Nature for herself
	Against infection and the hand of war,
	This happy breed of men, this little world,
	This precious stone set in the silver sea,
	Which serves it in the office of a wall,
	Or as a moat defensive to a house,
	Against the envy of less happier lands,
	This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
	This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,
	Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,
	Renowned for their deeds as far from home,—
	For Christian service and true chivalry,—
	As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry
	Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son:
	This land of such dear souls, this dear, dear land,
	Dear for her reputation through the world,
	Is now leas'd out,—I die pronouncing it,—
	Like to a tenement, or pelting farm:
	England, bound in with the triumphant sea,
	Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
	Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
	With inky blots, and rotten parchment bonds:
	That England, that was wont to conquer others,
	Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
	Ah! would the scandal vanish with my life,

<QUEEN>	<34%>
	To please the king I did; to please myself
	I cannot do it; yet I know no cause

	Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,
	Is coming towards me, and my inward soul

	More than with parting from my lord the king.
</QUEEN>

<BUSHY>	<35%>
	Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
	Which show like grief itself, but are not so.
	For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,
	Divides one thing entire to many objects;
	Like perspectives, which rightly gaz'd upon
	Show nothing but confusion; ey'd awry
	Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,
	Looking awry upon your lord's departure,
	Finds shapes of grief more than himself to wail;
	Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows
	Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
	More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;
	Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,
	Which for things true weeps things imaginary.
</BUSHY>

<QUEEN>	<35%>
	It may be so; but yet my inward soul
	Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,

	Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.
</QUEEN>

<BUSHY>	<35%>
	'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.

	For nothing hath begot my something grief;

<GREEN>	<36%>
	That he, our hope, might have retir'd his power,

	So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,

	Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd

	Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away
	To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?
	If that my cousin king be King of England,
	It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.
	You have a son, Aumerle, my noble kinsman;
	Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,
	He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,
	To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.
	I am denied to sue my livery here,
	And yet my letters-patent give me leave:
	My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,
	And these and all are all amiss employ'd.

	My lords of England, let me tell you this:

	Be his own carver and cut out his way,

	Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.

	Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:
	I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,

	I would attach you all and make you stoop
	Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;

	I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;
	Unless you please to enter in the castle
	And there repose you for this night.

<BOLINGBROKE>	<46%>
	Bring forth these men.
	Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls—
	Since presently your souls must part your bodies—
	With too much urging your pernicious lives,
	For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood
	From off my hands, here in the view of men
	I will unfold some causes of your deaths.
	You have misled a prince, a royal king,
	A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
	By you unhappied and disfigur'd clean:
	You have in manner with your sinful hours
	Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,
	Broke the possession of a royal bed,
	And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks
	With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.
	Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,
	Near to the king in blood, and near in love
	Till you did make him misinterpret me,
	Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,
	And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,
	Eating the bitter bread of banishment;
	Whilst you have fed upon my signories,
	Dispark'd my parks, and felled my forest woods,
	From mine own windows torn my household coat,
	Raz'd out my impress, leaving me no sign,
	Save men's opinions and my living blood,
	To show the world I am a gentleman.
	This and much more, much more than twice all this,
	Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over
	To execution and the hand of death.

	Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
	To stand upon my kingdom once again.
	Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
	Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:
	As a long-parted mother with her child
	Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,
	So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
	And do thee favour with my royal hands.
	Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,
	Nor with thy sweets comfort his revenous sense;
	But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,
	And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,
	Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
	Which with usurping steps do trample thee.
	Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;
	And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,
	Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder
	Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
	Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.
	Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:
	This earth shall have a feeling and these stones
	Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king
	Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.
</K. RICHARD>

<CARLISLE>	<49%>
	Fear not, my lord: that power that made you king
	Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.
	The means that heaven yields must be embrac'd,
	And not neglected; else, if heaven would,
	And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,
	The proffer'd means of succour and redress.
</CARLISLE>

<AUMERLE>	<49%>
	He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
	Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,
	Grows strong and great in substance and in friends.
</AUMERLE>

<K. RICHARD>	<49%>
	Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
	That when the searching eye of heaven is hid
	Behind the globe, and lights the lower world,
	Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen,
	In murders and in outrage bloody here;
	But when, from under this terrestrial ball
	He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
	And darts his light through every guilty hole,
	Then murders, treasons, and detested sins,
	The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,
	Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
	So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
	Who all this while hath revell'd in the night
	Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,
	Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
	His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
	Not able to endure the sight of day,
	But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
	Not all the water in the rough rude sea
	Can wash the balm from an anointed king;
	The breath of worldly men cannot depose
	The deputy elected by the Lord.
	For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
	To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
	God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
	A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,
	Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.

	O! call back yesterday, bid time return,
	And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men:
	To-day, to-day, unhappy day too late,
	O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune, and thy state;
	For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead,
	Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispers'd, and fled.

	Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care;
	And what loss is it to be rid of care?
	Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
	Greater he shall not be: if he serve God
	We'll serve him too, and be his fellow so:
	Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;
	They break their faith to God as well as us:
	Cry woe, destruction, ruin, loss, decay;
	The worst is death, and death will have his day.

<SCROOP>	<52%>
	Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd
	To bear the tidings of calamity.
	Like an unseasonable stormy day
	Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,
	As if the world were all dissolv'd to tears,
	So high above his limits swells the rage
	Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land
	With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.
	White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps
	Against thy majesty; and boys, with women's voices,
	Strive to speak big, and clap their female joints
	In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown;
	Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
	Of double-fatal yew against thy state;
	Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills
	Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,
	And all goes worse than I have power to tell.

	Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.
	Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?

	That they have let the dangerous enemy
	Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?
	If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it.
	I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.

	Would they make peace? terrible hell make war
	Upon their spotted souls for this offence!
</K. RICHARD>

<SCROOP>	<53%>
	Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
	Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate.
	Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made
	With heads and not with hands: those whom you curse
	Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
	And lie full low, grav'd in the hollow ground.

<K. RICHARD>	<53%>
	No matter where. Of comfort no man speak:
	Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
	Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyes
	Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth;
	Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
	And yet not so—for what can we bequeath
	Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
	Our lands, our lives, and all are Bolingbroke's,
	And nothing can we call our own but death,
	And that small model of the barren earth
	Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
	For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
	And tell sad stories of the death of kings:
	How some have been depos'd, some slain in war,
	Some haunted by the ghosts they have depos'd,
	Some poison'd by their wives, some sleeping kill'd;
	All murder'd: for within the hollow crown
	That rounds the mortal temples of a king
	Keeps Death his court, and there the antick sits,
	Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp;
	Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
	To monarchize, be fear'd, and kill with looks,
	Infusing him with self and vain conceit
	As if this flesh which walls about our life
	Were brass impregnable; and humour'd thus
	Comes at the last, and with a little pin
	Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!
	Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood
	With solemn reverence: throw away respect,
	Tradition, form, and ceremonious duty,
	For you have but mistook me all this while:
	I live with bread like you, feel want,
	Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,
	How can you say to me I am a king?
</K. RICHARD>

<CARLISLE>	<54%>
	My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
	But presently prevent the ways to wail.
	To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
	Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,
	And so your follies fight against yourself.
	Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:
	And fight and die is death destroying death;
	Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.

	Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?
	Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.

	To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken.
	Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,

</STAGE DIR> Noble lord,
	Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle,
	Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
	Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:
	Henry Bolingbroke
	On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand,
	And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
	To his most royal person; hither come
	Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,
	Provided that my banishment repeal'd,
	And lands restor'd again be freely granted.
	If not, I'll use the advantage of my power,
	And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
	Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:
	The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
	It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench
	The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,
	My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
	Go, signify as much, while here we march
	Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
	Let's march without the noise of threat'ning drum,
	That from the castle's totter'd battlements
	Our fair appointments may be well perus'd.
	Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
	With no less terror than the elements
	Of fire and water, when their thundering shock
	At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
	Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:
	The rage be his, while on the earth I rain
	My waters; on the earth, and not on him.
	March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.

	And by the honourable tomb he swears,
	That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,
	And by the royalties of both your bloods,
	Currents that spring from one most gracious head,
	And by the buried hand of war-like Gaunt,
	And by the worth and honour of himself,
	Comprising all that may be sworn or said,
	His coming hither hath no further scope
	Than for his lineal royalties and to beg
	Enfranchisement immediate on his knees:
	Which on thy royal party granted once,
	His glittering arms he will commend to rust,
	His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart
	To faithful service of your majesty.
	This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;
	And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.

	The king shall do it: must he be depos'd?

	The name of king? o' God's name, let it go:
	I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,
	My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,
	My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,
	My figur'd goblets for a dish of wood,
	My sceptre for a palmer's walking-staff,
	My subjects for a pair of carved saints,
	And my large kingdom for a little grave,
	A little little grave, an obscure grave;
	Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,
	Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet
	May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;
	For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;
	And buried once, why not upon my head?
	Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!
	We'll make foul weather with despised tears;
	Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,
	And make a dearth in this revolting land.
	Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,
	And make some pretty match with shedding tears?
	As thus; to drop them still upon one place,
	Till they have fretted us a pair of graves
	Within the earth; and, there inlaid: 'There lies
	Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.'
	Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see
	I talk but idly and you laugh at me.
	Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,
	What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty
	Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?
	You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.

	Cousin, I am too young to be your father,

<LADY 1>	<64%>
	Of either, madam.
</LADY 1>

<QUEEN>	<64%>
	Of neither, girl:
	For if of joy, being altogether wanting,
	It doth remember me the more of sorrow;
	Or if of grief, being altogether had,
	It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:
	For what I have I need not to repeat,
	And what I want it boots not to complain.

	Madam, I'll sing.

<GARDENER>	<64%>
	Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,
	Which, like unruly children, make their sire
	Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:
	Give some supportance to the bending twigs.
	Go thou, and like an executioner,
	Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
	That look too lofty in our commonwealth:
	All must be even in our government.
	You thus employ'd, I will go root away
	The noisome weeds, that without profit suck
	The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.
</GARDENER>

<SERVANT 1>	<65%>
	Why should we in the compass of a pale
	Keep law and form and due proportion,
	Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,
	When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,
	Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers chok'd up,
	Her fruit-trees all unprun'd, her hedges ruin'd,
	Her knots disorder'd, and her wholesome herbs
	Swarming with caterpillars?
</SERVANT 1>

<GARDENER>	<65%>
	Hold thy peace:
	He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring
	Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf;
	The weeds that his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,
	That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,
	Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke;
	I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.
</GARDENER>

<SERVANT 1>	<65%>
	What! are they dead?
</SERVANT 1>

<GARDENER>	<65%>
	They are; and Bolingbroke
	Hath seiz'd the wasteful king. O! what pity is it
	That he hath not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
	As we this garden. We at time of year
	Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,
	Lest, being over-proud with sap and blood,
	With too much riches it confound itself:
	Had he done so to great and growing men,
	They might have liv'd to bear and he to taste
	Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches
	We lop away that bearing boughs may live:
	Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,
	Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.
</GARDENER>

<SERVANT 1>	<66%>
	What! think you then the king shall be depos'd?
</SERVANT 1>

<GARDENER>	<66%>
	Depress'd he is already, and depos'd
	'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night
	To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's,
	That tell black tidings.

	O! I am press'd to death through want of speaking.
<STAGE DIR>
<Coming forward.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,
	How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?
	What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee

	Why dost thou say King Richard is depos'd?
	Dar'st thou, thou little better thing than earth,
	Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how
	Cam'st thou by these ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.
</QUEEN>

<GARDENER>	<66%>
	Pardon me, madam: little joy have I
	To breathe these news, yet what I say is true.
	King Richard, he is in the mighty hold
	Of Bolingbroke; their fortunes both are weigh'd:
	In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,
	And some few vanities that make him light;
	But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,
	Besides himself, are all the English peers,
	And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.
	Post you to London and you'll find it so;
	I speak no more than every one doth know.
</GARDENER>

<QUEEN>	<67%>
	Nimble mischance. that art so light of foot,
	Doth not thy embassage belong to me,
	And am I last that knows it? O! thou think'st
	To serve me last, that I may longest keep
	Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,
	To meet at London London's king in woe.
	What! was I born to this, that my sad look
	Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?
	Gardener, for telling me these news of woe,
	Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow.

<BOLINGBROKE>	<68%>
	Call forth Bagot.
	Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;

<BOLINGBROKE>	<68%>

</BOLINGBROKE>

<BAGOT>	<68%>
	My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
	Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.
	In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,
	I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,
	That reacheth from the restful English court
	As far as Calais, to my uncle's head?'
	Amongst much other talk, that very time,
	I heard you say that you had rather refuse
	The offer of a hundred thousand crowns
	Than Bolingbroke's return to England;
	Adding withal, how blest this land would be
	In this your cousin's death.
</BAGOT>

<AUMERLE>	<68%>
	Princes and noble lords,
	What answer shall I make to this base man?
	Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,
	On equal terms to give him chastisement?
	Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd
	With the attainder of his slanderous lips.
	There is my gage, the manual seal of death,
	That marks thee out for hell: I say thou liest,
	And will maintain what thou hast said is false
	In thy heart-blood, though being all too base
	To stain the temper of my knightly sword.

<BOLINGBROKE>	<68%>
	Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.

<FITZWATER>	<69%>
	If that thy valour stand on sympathies,
	There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:
	By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st,
	I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spak'st it,
	That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.
	If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest;
	And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,
	Where it was forged, with my rapier's point.

<AUMERLE>	<69%>
	Thou dar'st not, coward, live to see that day.

	In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn:

	If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,

	And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith
	To tie thee to my strong correction.
	As I intend to thrive in this new world,
	Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:
	Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say
	That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men
	To execute the noble duke at Calais.

<AUMERLE>	<70%>

	These differences shall all rest under gage
	Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be,

	Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.

	And toil'd with works of war, retir'd himself
	To Italy; and there at Venice gave

	What subject can give sentence on his king?

	Thieves are not judg'd but they are by to hear,

	That in a Christian climate souls refin'd
	Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed.
	I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
	Stirr'd up by God thus boldly for his king.
	My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,
	Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king;
	And if you crown him, let me prophesy,
	The blood of English shall manure the ground
	And future ages groan for this foul act;
	Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,
	And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
	Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;
	Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny
	Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd
	The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.
	O! if you rear this house against this house,
	It will the woefullest division prove

<K. RICHARD>	<74%>
	Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.

<K. RICHARD>	<74%>
	Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;
	Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.
	Now mark me how I will undo myself:
	I give this heavy weight from off my head,
	And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,
	The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;
	With mine own tears I wash away my balm,
	With mine own hands I give away my crown,
	With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,
	With mine own breath release all duteous rites:
	All pomp and majesty I do forswear;
	My manors, rents, revenues, I forego;
	My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:
	God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!
	God keep all vows unbroke are made to thee!
	Make me, that nothing have, with nothing griev'd,
	And thou with all pleas'd, that hast all achiev'd!
	Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,
	And soon lie Richard in an earthy pit!
	God save King Henry, unking'd Richard says,
	And send him many years of sunshine days!

	There shouldst thou find one heinous article,
	Containing the deposing of a king,
	And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,
	Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven.
	Nay, all of you that stand and look upon me,
	Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,
	Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands,
	Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates
	Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,

	Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,
	I find myself a traitor with the rest;
	For I have given here my soul's consent
	To undeck the pompous body of a king;
	Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,

	That I have worn so many winters out,
	And know not now what name to call myself.
	O! that I were a mockery king of snow,
	Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,
	To melt myself away in water-drops.
	Good king, great king,—and yet not greatly good,
	An if my word be sterling yet in England,
	Let it command a mirror hither straight,

	'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;
	And these external manners of laments
	Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
	That swells with silence in the tortur'd soul;
	There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,
	For thy great bounty, that not only giv'st
	Me cause to wail, but teachest me the way
	How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,
	And then be gone and trouble you no more.

	This way the king will come; this is the way

	But soft, but see, or rather do not see,
	My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,
	That you in pity may dissolve to dew,
	And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.
	Ah! thou, the model where old Troy did stand,
	Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,
	And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,
	Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodg'd in thee,
</QUEEN>
	When triumph is become an alehouse guest?
<K. RICHARD>	<80%>
	Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,
	To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,
	To think our former state a happy dream;
	From which awak'd, the truth of what we are
	Shows us but this. I am sworn brother, sweet,
	To grim Necessity, and he and I
	Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France,
	And cloister thee in some religious house:
	Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,
	Which our profane hours here have stricken down.
</K. RICHARD>

<QUEEN>	<80%>
	What! is my Richard both in shape and mind
	Transform'd and weaken'd! Hath Bolingbroke depos'd
	Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?
	The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw
	And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage
	To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,
	Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,
	And fawn on rage with base humility,
	Which art a lion and a king of beasts?
</QUEEN>

<K. RICHARD>	<80%>
	A king of beasts indeed; if aught but beasts,
	I had been still a happy king of men.
	Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France,
	Think I am dead, and that even here thou tak'st,
	As from my death-bed, my last living leave.
	In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire
	With good old folks, and let them tell thee tales
	Of woeful ages, long ago betid;
	And ere thou bid good night, to quit their grief,
	Tell thou the lamentable tale of me,
	And send the hearers weeping to their beds:
	For why the senseless brands will sympathize
	The heavy accent of thy moving tongue,
	And in compassion weep the fire out;
	And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,
	For the deposing of a rightful king.

</STAGE DIR>
<NORTHUMBERLAND>	<81%>
	My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is chang'd;

	And, madam, there is order ta'en for you;
	With all swift speed you must away to France.
</NORTHUMBERLAND>

<K. RICHARD>	<81%>
	Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal
	The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,
	The time shall not be many hours of age
	More than it is, ere foul sin gathering head
	Shall break into corruption. Thou shalt think,
	Though he divide the realm and give thee half,
	It is too little, helping him to all;
	And he shall think that thou, which know'st the way
	To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,
	Being ne'er so little urg'd, another way
	To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.
	The love of wicked friends converts to fear;
	That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both
	To worthy danger and deserved death.
</K. RICHARD>

<NORTHUMBERLAND>	<81%>
	My guilt be on my head, and there an end.
	Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.
</NORTHUMBERLAND>

<K. RICHARD>	<82%>
	Doubly divorc'd! Bad men, ye violate
	A two-fold marriage; 'twixt my crown and me,
	And then, betwixt me and my married wife.
	Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;
	And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.
	Part us, Northumberland: I towards the north,
	Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;
	My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,
	She came adorned hither like sweet May,
	Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.
</K. RICHARD>

<QUEEN>	<82%>
	And must we be divided? must we part?
</QUEEN>

<K. RICHARD>	<82%>
	Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.
</K. RICHARD>

<QUEEN>	<82%>
	Banish us both and send the king with me.
</QUEEN>

<NORTHUMBERLAND>	<82%>

	Then whither he goes, thither let me go.

</K. RICHARD>

<QUEEN>	<82%>
	So longest way shall have the longest moans.
</QUEEN>

<K. RICHARD>	<82%>
	Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,
	And piece the way out with a heavy heart.
	Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,
	Since, wedding it, thero is such length in grief.
	One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;
	Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.
</K. RICHARD>
<STAGE DIR>
<They kiss.>

<QUEEN>	<83%>
	Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part

	While all tongues cried, 'God save thee, Bolingbroke!'
	You would have thought the very windows spake,
	So many greedy looks of young and old
	Through casements darted their desiring eyes
	Upon his visage, and that all the walls
	With painted imagery had said at once
	'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'
	Whilst he, from one side to the other turning,
	Bare-headed, lower than his proud steed's neck,
	Bespake them thus, 'I thank you, countrymen:'
	And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.

	Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes
	Did scowl on Richard: no man cried, 'God save him;'
	No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home;
	But dust was thrown upon his sacred head,
	Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,
	His face still combating with tears and smiles,
	The badges of his grief and patience,
	That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd
	The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted,
	And barbarism itself have pitied him.

<SCENE 5>
<Pomfret. The Dungeon of the Castle.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter King Richard.>
</STAGE DIR>
<K. RICHARD>	<94%>
	I have been studying how I may compare
	This prison where I live unto the world:
	And for because the world is populous,
	And here is not a creature but myself,
	I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.
	My brain I'll prove the female to my soul;
	My soul the father: and these two beget
	A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
	And these same thoughts people this little world
	In humours like the people of this world,
	For no thought is contented. The better sort,
	As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
	With scruples, and do set the word itself
	Against the word:
	As thus, 'Come, little ones;' and then again,
	'It is as hard to come as for a camel
	To thread the postern of a needle's eye.'
	Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
	Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
	May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
	Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls;
	And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
	Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
	That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
	Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars
	Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,
	That many have and others must sit there:
	And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
	Bearing their own misfortune on the back
	Of such as have before endur'd the like.
	Thus play I in one person many people,
	And none contented: sometimes am I king;
	Then treason makes me wish myself a beggar,
	And so I am: then crushing penury
	Persuades me I was better when a king;
	Then am I king'd again; and by and by
	Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
	And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,
	Nor I nor any man that but man is
	With nothing shall be pleas'd, till he be eas'd
	With being nothing. Music do I hear?
<STAGE DIR>
<Music.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Ha, ha! keep time. How sour sweet music is
	When time is broke and no proportion kept!
	So is it in the music of men's lives.
	And here have I the daintiness of ear
	To check time broke in a disorder'd string;
	But for the concord of my state and time
	Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
	I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
	For now hath time made me his numbering clock:
	My thoughts are minutes, and with sighs they jar
	Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
	Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
	Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
	Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
	Are clamorous groans, that strike upon my heart
	Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans
	Show minutes, times, and hours; but my time
	Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
	While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.
	This music mads me: let it sound no more;
	For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
	In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
	Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
	For 'tis a sign of love, and love to Richard
	Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.

	O! how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld
	In London streets, that coronation day
	When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,
	That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,
	That horse that I so carefully have dress'd.

	This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.
	Would he not stumble? Would he not fall down,—
	Since pride must have a fall,—and break the neck
	Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
	Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,
	Since thou, created to be aw'd by man,
	Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;
	And yet I bear a burden like an ass,
	Spur-gall'd and tir'd by jauncing Bolingbroke.
