	Yes, sir: as well as you dare patronage
	The envious barking of your saucy tongue
	Against my lord the Duke of Somerset.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
	Why, what is he? as good a man as York.

	Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
	That, whoso draws a sword, 'tis present death,
	Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood.
	But I'll unto his majesty, and crave
	I may have liberty to venge this wrong;
	When thou shalt see I'll meet thee to thy cost.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	And me, my lord; grant me the combat too!
<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.

	Crossing the sea from England into France,
	This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,
	Upbraided me about the rose I wear;
	Saying, the sanguine colour of the leaves
	Did represent my master's blushing cheeks,
	When stubbornly he did repugn the truth
	About a certain question in the law
	Argu'd betwixt the Duke of York and him;
	With other vile and ignominious terms:
	In confutation of which rude reproach,
	And in defence of my lord's worthiness,
	I crave the benefit of law of arms.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
	Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.
