	Let's raise the siege: why live we idly here?
	Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear:
	Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury,
	And he may well in fretting spend his gall;
	Nor men nor money hath he to make war.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	Salisbury is a desperate homicide;
	He fighteth as one weary of his life:
	The other lords, like lions wanting food,
	Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	I think, by some odd gimmals or device,
	Their arms are set like clocks, still to strike on;
	Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
	By my consent, we'll e'en let them alone.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	She takes upon her bravely at first dash.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	My lord, where are you? what devise you on?
	Shall we give over Orleans, or no?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
	Woman, do what thou canst to save our honours;
	Drive them from Orleans and be immortalis'd.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 6><22%>
	Why ring not out the bells throughout the town?
	Dauphin, command the citizens make bonfires
	And feast and banquet in the open streets,
	To celebrate the joy that God hath given us.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	'Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds,
	Hearing alarums at our chamber-doors.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	If not of hell, the heavens, sure, favour him.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	And so was mine, my lord.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
	To whom?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
	Suffolk, what remedy?
	I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,
	Or to exclaim on Fortune's fickleness.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
	Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
	Upon thy princely warrant, I descend
	To give thee answer of thy just demand.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	Welcome, brave earl, into our territories:
	Command in Anjou what your honour pleases.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
	To be the princely bride of such a lord,
	Upon condition I may quietly
	Enjoy mine own, the county Maine and Anjou,
	Free from oppression or the stroke of war,
	My daughter shall be Henry's if he please.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	And I again, in Henry's royal name,
	As deputy unto that gracious king,
	Give thee her hand for sign of plighted faith.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	I do embrace thee, as I would embrace
	The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 4><96%>
	My lord, you do not well in obstinacy
	To cavil in the course of this contract:
	If once it be neglected, ten to one,
	We shall not find like opportunity.
