	My lord, we know your Grace to be a man
	Just and upright, and, for your royal birth,
	Inferior to none but to his majesty;
	And ere that we will suffer such a prince,
	So kind a father of the commonweal,
	To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,
	We and our wives and children all will fight,
	And have our bodies slaught'red by thy foes.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	And I will see what physic the tavern affords.
