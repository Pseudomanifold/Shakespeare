	Reignier, is't thou that thinkest to beguile me?
	Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind;
	I know thee well, though never seen before.
	Be not amaz'd, there's nothing hid from me:
	In private will I talk with thee apart.
	Stand back, you lords, and give us leave a while.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,
	My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.
	Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleas'd
	To shine on my contemptible estate:
	Lo! whilst I waited on my tender lambs,
	And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,
	God's mother deigned to appear to me,
	And in a vision full of majesty
	Will'd me to leave my base vocation
	And free my country from calamity:
	Her aid she promis'd and assur'd success;
	In complete glory she reveal'd herself;
	And, whereas I was black and swart before,
	With those clear rays which she infus'd on me,
	That beauty am I bless'd with which you see.
	Ask me what question thou canst possible
	And I will answer unpremeditated:
	My courage try by combat, if thou dar'st,
	And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.
	Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate
	If thou receive me for thy war-like mate.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	I am prepar'd: here is my keen-edg'd sword,
	Deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side;
	The which at Touraine, in Saint Katharine's churchyard,
	Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	And, while I live, I'll ne'er fly from a man.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
	Christ's mother helps me, else I were too weak.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	I must not yield to any rites of love,
	For my profession's sacred from above:
	When I have chased all thy foes from hence,
	Then will I think upon a recompense.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	Why, no, I say, distrustful recreants!
	Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
	Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.
	This night the siege assuredly I'll raise:
	Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyon days,
	Since I have entered into these wars.
	Glory is like a circle in the water,
	Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself,
	Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.
	With Henry's death the English circle ends;
	Dispersed are the glories it included.
	Now am I like that proud insulting ship
	Which Cæsar and his fortune bare at once.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 5><21%>
	Come, come; 'tis only I that must disgrace thee.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 5><21%>
	Talbot, farewell; thy hour is not yet come:
	I must go victual Orleans forthwith.
	O'ertake me if thou canst; I scorn thy strength.
	Go, go, cheer up thy hunger-starved men;
	Help Salisbury to make his testament:
	This day is ours, as many more shall be.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 6><22%>
	Advance our waving colours on the walls;
	Rescu'd is Orleans from the English:
	Thus Joan la Pucelle hath perform'd her word.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
	Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend?
	At all times will you have my power alike?
	Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,
	Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?
	Improvident soldiers! had your watch been good,
	This sudden mischief never could have fall'n.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	Question, my lords, no further of the case,
	How or which way: 'tis sure they found some place
	But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.
	And now there rests no other shift but this;
	To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispers'd,
	And lay new platforms to endamage them.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
	These are the city gates, the gates of Roan,
	Through which our policy must make a breach:
	Take heed, be wary how you place your words;
	Talk like the vulgar sort of market-men
	That come to gather money for their corn.
	If we have entrance,—as I hope we shall,—
	And that we find the slothful watch but weak,
	I'll by a sign give notice to our friends,
	That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	Paisans, pauvres gens de France:
	Poor market-folks that come to sell their corn.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	Now, Roan, I'll shake thy bulwarks to the ground.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	Behold! this is the happy wedding torch
	That joineth Roan unto her countrymen,
	But burning fatal to the Talbotites!
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	Good morrow, gallants! Want ye corn for bread?
	I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast
	Before he'll buy again at such a rate.
	'Twas full of darnel; do you like the taste?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	What will you do, good grey-beard? break a lance,
	And run a tilt at death within a chair?
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	Are you so hot, sir? Yet, Pucelle, hold thy peace;
	If Talbot do but thunder, rain will follow.
	God speed the parliament! who shall be the speaker?
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	Belike your lordship takes us then for fools,
	To try if that our own be ours or no.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	Away, captains! let's get us from the walls;
	For Talbot means no-goodness, by his looks.
	God be wi' you, my lord! we came but to tell you
	That we are here.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
	Dismay not, princes, at this accident,
	Nor grieve that Roan is so recovered:
	Care is no cure, but rather corrosive,
	For things that are not to be remedied.
	Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while,
	And like a peacock sweep along his tail;
	We'll pull his plumes and take away his train,
	If Dauphin and the rest will be but rul'd.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
	Then thus it must be; this doth Joan devise:
	By fair persuasions, mix'd with sugar'd words,
	We will entice the Duke of Burgundy
	To leave the Talbot and to follow us.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
	Your honours shall perceive how I will work
	To bring this matter to the wished end.
	Hark! by the sound of drum you may perceive
	Their powers are marching unto Paris-ward.
	There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread,
	And all the troops of English after him.
	Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:
	Fortune in favour makes him lag behind.
	Summon a parley; we will talk with him.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
	The princely Charles of France, thy countryman.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
	Brave Burgundy, undoubted hope of France!
	Stay, let thy humble handmaid speak to thee.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
	Look on thy country, look on fertile France,
	And see the cities and the towns defac'd
	By wasting ruin of the cruel foe.
	As looks the mother on her lowly babe
	When death doth close his tender dying eyes,
	See, see the pining malady of France;
	Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,
	Which thou thyself hast giv'n her woeful breast.
	O! turn thy edged sword another way;
	Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help.
	One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom,
	Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore:
	Return thee therefore, with a flood of tears,
	And wash away thy country's stained spots.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
	Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,
	Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.
	Who join'st thou with but with a lordly nation
	That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?
	When Talbot hath set footing once in France,
	And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,
	Who then but English Henry will be lord,
	And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?
	Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof,
	Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe,
	And was he not in England prisoner?
	But when they heard he was thine enemy,
	They set him free, without his ransom paid,
	In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.
	See then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen!
	And join'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.
	Come, come, return; return thou wand'ring lord;
	Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
	Done like a Frenchman: turn, and turn again!
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 7><77%>
	Once I encounter'd him, and thus I said:
	'Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid:'
	But with a proud majestical high scorn,
	He answer'd thus: 'Young Talbot was not born
	To be the pillage of a giglot wench.'
	So, rushing in the bowels of the French,
	He left me proudly, as unworthy fight.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 7><79%>
	Here is a silly stately style indeed!
	The Turk, that two-and-fifty kingdoms hath,
	Writes not so tedious a style as this.
	Him that thou magnifiest with all these titles,
	Stinking and fly-blown lies here at our feet.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 7><79%>
	I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost,
	He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit.
	For God's sake, let him have 'em; to keep them here
	They would but stink and putrefy the air.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 2><82%>
	Peace be amongst them if they turn to us;
	Else, ruin combat with their palaces!
<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 2><83%>
	Of all base passions, fear is most accurs'd.
	Command the conquest, Charles, it shall be thine;
	Let Henry fret and all the world repine.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 5><SCENE 3><83%>
	The regent conquers and the Frenchmen fly.
	Now help, ye charming spells and periapts;
	And ye choice spirits that admonish me
	And give me signs of future accidents:
	You speedy helpers, that are substitutes
	Under the lordly monarch of the north,
	Appear, and aid me in this enterprise!
	This speedy and quick appearance argues proof
	Of your accustom'd diligence to me.
	Now, ye familiar spirits, that are cull'd
	Out of the powerful regions under earth,
	Help me this once, that France may get the field.
	O! hold me not with silence over-long.
	Where I was wont to feed you with my blood,
	I'll lop a member off and give it you,
	In earnest of a further benefit,
	So you do condescend to help me now.
	No hope to have redress? My body shall
	Pay recompense, if you will grant my suit.
	Cannot my body nor blood-sacrifice
	Entreat you to your wonted furtherance?
	Then take my soul; my body, soul, and all,
	Before that England give the French the foil.
	See! they forsake me. Now the time is come,
	That France must vail her lofty-plumed crest,
	And let her head fall into England's lap.
	My ancient incantations are too weak,
	And hell too strong for me to buckle with:
	Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 5><SCENE 3><84%>
	Chang'd to a worser shape thou canst not be.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 5><SCENE 3><84%>
	A plaguing mischief light on Charles and thee!
	And may ye both be suddenly surpris'd
	By bloody hands, in sleeping on your beds!
<SPEECH 39><ACT 5><SCENE 3><85%>
	I prithee, give me leave to curse a while.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 5><SCENE 4><91%>
	Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!
	I am descended of a gentler blood:
	Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 5><SCENE 4><91%>
	Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man,
	Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 5><SCENE 4><92%>
	First, let me tell you whom you have condemn'd:
	Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,
	But issu'd from the progeny of kings;
	Virtuous and holy; chosen from above,
	By inspiration of celestial grace,
	To work exceeding miracles on earth.
	I never had to do with wicked spirits:
	But you,—that are polluted with your lusts,
	Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents,
	Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,—
	Because you want the grace that others have,
	You judge it straight a thing impossible
	To compass wonders but by help of devils.
	No misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been
	A virgin from her tender infancy,
	Chaste and immaculate in very thought;
	Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effus'd,
	Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 4><92%>
	Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?
	Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity;
	That warranteth by law to be thy privilege.
	I am with child, ye bloody homicides:
	Murder not then the fruit within my womb,
	Although ye hale me to a violent death.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 4><93%>
	You are deceiv'd; my child is none of his:
	It was Alençon that enjoy'd my love.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 4><93%>
	O! give me leave, I have deluded you:
	'Twas neither Charles, nor yet the duke I nam'd,
	But Reignier, King of Naples, that prevail'd.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 5><SCENE 4><93%>
	Then lead me hence; with whom I leave my curse:
	May never glorious sun reflex his beams
	Upon the country where you make abode;
	But darkness and the gloomy shade of death
	Environ you, till mischief and despair
	Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!
