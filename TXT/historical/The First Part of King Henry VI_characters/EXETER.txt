	We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?
	Henry is dead and never shall revive.
	Upon a wooden coffin we attend,
	And death's dishonourable victory
	We with our stately presence glorify,
	Like captives bound to a triumphant car.
	What! shall we curse the planets of mishap
	That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?
	Or shall we think the subtle-witted French
	Conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him,
	By magic verses have contriv'd his end?

	Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,

	Ay, we may march in England or in France,
	Not seeing what is likely to ensue.
	This late dissension grown betwixt the peers
	Burns under feigned ashes of forg'd love,
	And will at last break out into a flame:
	As fester'd members rot but by degree,
	Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,
	So will this base and envious discord breed.
	And now I fear that fatal prophecy
	Which in the time of Henry, nam'd the Fifth,
	Was in the mouth of every sucking babe;
	That Henry born at Monmouth should win all;
	And Henry born at Windsor should lose all:
	Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish
	His days may finish ere that hapless time.

	Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice;
	For had the passions of thy heart burst out,
	I fear we should have seen decipher'd there
	More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,
	Than yet can be imagin'd or suppos'd.
	But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees
	This jarring discord of nobility,
	This shouldering of each other in the court,
	This factious bandying of their favourites,
	But that it doth presage some ill event.
	'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;
	But more, when envy breeds unkind division:
	There comes the ruin, there begins confusion.

	</STAGE DIR> What! is my Lord of Winchester install'd,
	And call'd unto a cardinal's degree?
	Then, I perceive that will be verified
	Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy,â€”
	'If once he come to be a cardinal,
	He'll make his cap co-equal with the crown.'

	Beside, his wealth doth warrant liberal dower,
