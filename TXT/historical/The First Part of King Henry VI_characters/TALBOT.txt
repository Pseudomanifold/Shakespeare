	The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner
	Called the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;
	For him I was exchang'd and ransomed.
	But with a baser man at arms by far
	Once in contempt they would have barter'd me:
	Which I disdaining scorn'd, and craved death
	Rather than I would be so vile-esteem'd.
	In fine, redeem'd I was as I desir'd.
	But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart:
	Whom with my bare fists I would execute
	If I now had him brought into my power.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 4><17%>
	With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.
	In open market-place produc'd they me,
	To be a public spectacle to all:
	Here, said they, is the terror of the French,
	The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
	Then broke I from the officers that led me,
	And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
	To hurl at the beholders of my shame.
	My grisly countenance made others fly.
	None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
	In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
	So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread
	That they suppos'd I could rend bars of steel
	And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:
	Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,
	That walk'd about me every minute-while;
	And if I did but stir out of my bed
	Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 4><18%>
	For aught I see, this city must be famish'd,
	Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 4><19%>
	What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?
	Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak:
	How far'st thou, mirror of all martial men?
	One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
	Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
	That hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy!
	In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;
	Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;
	Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up,
	His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.
	Yet liv'st thou, Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,
	One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace:
	The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
	Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,
	If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
	Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.
	Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?
	Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.
	Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort;
	Thou shalt not die, whiles—
	He beckons with his hand and smiles on me,
	As who should say, 'When I am dead and gone,
	Remember to avenge me on the French.'
	Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,
	Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:
	Wretched shall France be only in my name.
	What stir is this? What tumult's in the heavens?
	Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 4><20%>
	Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan!
	It irks his heart he cannot be reveng'd.
	Frenchmen, I'll be a Salisbury to you:
	Pucelle or puzzel, dolphin or dogfish,
	Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels
	And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.
	Convey me Salisbury into his tent,
	And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 5><20%>
	Where is my strength, my valour, and my force?
	Our English troops retire, I cannot stay them;
	A woman clad in armour chaseth them.
	Here, here she comes. I'll have a bout with thee:
	Devil, or devil's dam, I'll conjure thee:
	Blood will I draw on thee, thou art a witch,
	And straightway give thy soul to him thou serv'st.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 5><21%>
	Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail?
	My breast I'll burst with straining of my courage,
	And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder,
	But I will chastise this high-minded strumpet.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 5><21%>
	My thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel;
	I know not where I am, nor what I do:
	A witch, by fear, not force, like Hannibal,
	Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists:
	So bees with smoke, and doves with noisome stench,
	Are from their hives and houses driven away.
	They call'd us for our fierceness English dogs;
	Now, like to whelps, we crying run away.
	Hark, countrymen! either renew the fight,
	Or tear the lions out of England's coat;
	Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions' stead:
	Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,
	Or horse or oxen from the leopard,
	As you fly from your oft-subdued slaves.
	It will not be: retire into your trenches:
	You all consented unto Salisbury's death,
	For none would strike a stroke in his revenge.
	Pucelle is entered into Orleans
	In spite of us or aught that we could do.
	O! would I were to die with Salisbury.
	The shame hereof will make me hide my head.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Lord regent, and redoubted Burgundy,
	By whose approach the regions of Artois,
	Walloon, and Picardy, are friends to us,
	This happy night the Frenchmen are secure,
	Having all day carous'd and banqueted:
	Embrace we then this opportunity,
	As fitting best to quittance their deceit
	Contriv'd by art and baleful sorcery.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	A maid, they say.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>

	Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	Not all together: better far, I guess,
	That we do make our entrance several ways,
	That if it chance the one of us do fail,
	The other yet may rise against their force.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
	And here will Talbot mount, or make his grave.
	Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right
	Of English Henry, shall this night appear
	How much in duty I am bound to both.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 2><27%>
	Bring forth the body of old Salisbury,
	And here advance it in the market-place,
	The middle centre of this cursed town.
	Now have I paid my vow unto his soul;
	For every drop of blood was drawn from him
	There hath at least five Frenchmen died to-night.
	And that hereafter ages may behold
	What ruin happen'd in revenge of him,
	Within their chiefest temple I'll erect
	A tomb wherein his corse shall be interr'd:
	Upon the which, that every one may read,
	Shall be engrav'd the sack of Orleans,
	The treacherous manner of his mournful death,
	And what a terror he had been to France.
	But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,
	I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,
	His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc,
	Nor any of his false confederates.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	Here is the Talbot: who would speak with him?
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	Ne'er trust me then; for when a world of men
	Could not prevail with all their oratory,
	Yet hath a woman's kindness over-rul'd:
	And therefore tell her I return great thanks,
	And in submission will attend on her.
	Will not your honours bear me company?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	Well then, alone,—since there's no remedy,—

<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
	Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,

<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
	Ha, ha, ha!
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
	I laugh to see your ladyship so fond

<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
	I am, indeed.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
	No, no, I am but shadow of myself:
	You are deceiv'd, my substance is not here;
	For what you see is but the smallest part
	And least proportion of humanity.
	I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,
	It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
	Your roof were not sufficient to contain it.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
	That will I show you presently.
	How say you, madam? are you now persuaded
	That Talbot is but shadow of himself?
	These are his substance, sinews, arms, and strength,
	With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,
	Razeth your cities, and subverts your towns,
	And in a moment makes them desolate.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
	Be not dismay'd, fair lady; nor misconster
	The mind of Talbot as you did mistake
	The outward composition of his body.
	What you have done hath not offended me;
	Nor other satisfaction do I crave,
	But only, with your patience, that we may
	Taste of your wine and see what cates you have;
	For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears,
	If Talbot but survive thy treachery.
	Pucelle, that witch, that damned sorceress,

	That hardly we escap'd the pride of France.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite,
	Encompass'd with thy lustful paramours!

	Or else let Talbot perish with this shame.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	I speak not to that railing Hecate,

	Will ye, like soldiers, come and fight it out?

	Signior, hang! base muleters of France!
	Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls,

<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
	And there will we be too, ere it be long,
	Or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame!
	Vow, Burgundy, by honour of thy house,—
	Prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France,—
	Either to get the town again, or die;
	And I, as sure as English Henry lives,
	And as his father here was conqueror,
	As sure as in this late-betrayed town
	Great Cœur-de-lion's heart was buried,
	So sure I swear to get the town or die.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
	But, ere we go, regard this dying prince,
	The valiant Duke of Bedford. Come, my lord,
	We will bestow you in some better place,
	Fitter for sickness and for crazy age.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
	Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!
	Then be it so: heavens keep old Bedford safe!
	And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,
	But gather we our forces out of hand,
	And set upon our boasting enemy.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	Lost, and recover'd in a day again!
	This is a double honour, Burgundy:
	Yet heavens have glory for this victory!
<SPEECH 36><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	Thanks, gentle duke. But where is Pucelle now?
	I think her old familiar is asleep.
	Now where's the Bastard's braves, and Charles his gleeks?
	What! all amort? Roan hangs her head for grief,
	That such a valiant company are fled.
	Now will we take some order in the town,
	Placing therein some expert officers,
	And then depart to Paris to the king;
	For there young Henry with his nobles lie.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	But yet, before we go, let's not forget
	The noble Duke of Bedford late deceas'd,
	But see his exequies fulfill'd in Roan:
	A braver soldier never couched lance,
	A gentler heart did never sway in court;
	But kings and mightiest potentates must die,
	For that's the end of human misery.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 4><58%>
	My gracious prince, and honourable peers,
	Hearing of your arrival in this realm,
	I have a while giv'n truce unto my wars,
	To do my duty to my sovereign:
	In sign whereof, this arm,—that hath reclaim'd
	To your obedience fifty fortresses,
	Twelve cities, and seven walled towns of strength,
	Beside five hundred prisoners of esteem,—
	Lets fall his sword before your highness' feet,
	And with submissive loyalty of heart,
	Ascribes the glory of his conquest got,
	First to my God, and next unto your Grace.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
	Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!
	I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next,
	To tear the garter from thy craven's leg;
	Which I have done, because unworthily
	Thou wast installed in that high degree.
	Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest:
	This dastard, at the battle of Patay,
	When but in all I was six thousand strong,
	And that the French were almost ten to one,
	Before we met or that a stroke was given,
	Like to a trusty squire did run away:
	In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;
	Myself, and divers gentlemen beside,
	Were there surpris'd and taken prisoners.
	Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss;
	Or whether that such cowards ought to wear
	This ornament of knighthood, yea, or no?
<SPEECH 40><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
	When first this order was ordain'd, my lords,
	Knights of the garter were of noble birth,
	Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,
	Such as were grown to credit by the wars;
	Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,
	But always resolute in most extremes.
	He then that is not furnish'd in this sort
	Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,
	Profaning this most honourable order;
	And should—if I were worthy to be judge—
	Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain
	That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	Content, my liege! Yes: but that I am prevented,
	I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
	I go, my lord; in heart desiring still
	You may behold confusion of your foes.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Go to the gates of Bourdeaux, trumpeter;
	Summon their general unto the wall.
	English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,
	Servant in arms to Harry King of England;
	And thus he would: Open your city gates,
	Be humble to us, call my sov'reign yours,
	And do him homage as obedient subjects,
	And I'll withdraw me and my bloody power;
	But, if you frown upon this proffer'd peace,
	You tempt the fury of my three attendants,
	Lean famine, quartering steel, and climbing fire;
	Who in a moment even with the earth
	Shall lay your stately and air-braving towers,
	If you forsake the offer of their love.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	He fables not; I hear the enemy:
	Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.
	O! negligent and heedless discipline;
	How are we park'd and bounded in a pale,
	A little herd of England's timorous deer,
	Maz'd with a yelping kennel of French curs!
	If we be English deer, be then, in blood;
	Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch,
	But rather moody-mad and desperate stags,
	Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel,
	And make the cowards stand aloof at bay:
	Sell every man his life as dear as mine,
	And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends.
	God and Saint George, Talbot and England's right,
	Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight!
<SPEECH 45><ACT 4><SCENE 5><72%>
	O young John Talbot! I did send for thee
	To tutor thee in stratagems of war,
	That Talbot's name might be in thee reviv'd
	When sapless age, and weak unable limbs
	Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.
	But,—O malignant and ill-boding stars!
	Now thou art come unto a feast of death,
	A terrible and unavoided danger:
	Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse,
	And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape
	By sudden flight: come, dally not, be gone.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 4><SCENE 5><72%>
	Fly, to revenge my death, if I be slain.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>

	Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
	And leave my followers here to fight and die?
	My age was never tainted with such shame.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
	Then here I take my leave of thee, fair son,
	Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon.
	Come, side by side together live and die,
	And soul with soul from France to heaven fly.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 4><SCENE 6><74%>
	Saint George and victory! fight, soldiers, fight!
	The regent hath with Talbot broke his word,
	And left us to the rage of France his sword.
	Where is John Talbot? Pause, and take thy breath:
	I gave thee life and rescu'd thee from death.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 4><SCENE 6><74%>
	When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire,
	It warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire
	Of bold-fac'd victory. Then leaden age,
	Quicken'd with youthful spleen and war-like rage,
	Beat down Alençon, Orleans, Burgundy,
	And from the pride of Gallia rescu'd thee.
	The ireful bastard Orleans,—that drew blood
	From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood
	Of thy first fight,—I soon encountered
	And, interchanging blows, I quickly shed
	Some of his bastard blood; and, in disgrace,
	Bespoke him thus, 'Contaminated, base,
	And misbegotten blood I spill of thine,
	Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine
	Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy:'
	Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy,
	Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father's care,
	Art thou not weary, John? How dost thou fare?
	Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,
	Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry?
	Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead;
	The help of one stands me in little stead.
	O! too much folly is it, well I wot,
	To hazard all our lives in one small boat.
	If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage,
	To-morrow I shall die with mickle age:
	By me they nothing gain an if I stay;
	'Tis but the short'ning of my life one day.
	In thee thy mother dies, our household's name,
	My death's revenge, thy youth, and England's fame.
	All these and more we hazard by thy stay;
	All these are sav'd if thou wilt fly away.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 4><SCENE 6><76%>
	Then follow thou thy desperate sire of Crete,
	Thou Icarus. Thy life to me is sweet:
	If thou wilt fight, fight by thy father's side,
	And, commendable prov'd, let's die in pride.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 4><SCENE 7><76%>
	Where is my other life?—mine own is gone;—
	O! where's young Talbot? where is valiant John?
	Triumphant death, smear'd with captivity,
	Young Talbot's valour makes me smile at thee.
	When he perceiv'd me shrink and on my knee,
	His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,
	And like a hungry lion did commence
	Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;
	But when my angry guardant stood alone,
	Tendering my ruin and assail'd of none,
	Dizzy-ey'd fury and great rage of heart
	Suddenly made him from my side to start
	Into the clust'ring battle of the French;
	And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
	His overmounting spirit; and there died
	My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 4><SCENE 7><77%>
	Thou antick, death, which laugh'st us here to scorn,
	Anon, from thy insulting tyranny,
	Coupled in bonds of perpetuity,
	Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky,
	In thy despite shall 'scape mortality.
	O! thou, whose wounds become hard-favour'd death,
	Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath;
	Brave death by speaking whe'r he will or no;
	Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.
	Poor boy! he smiles, methinks, as who should say,
	Had death been French, then death had died to-day.
	Come, come, and lay him in his father's arms:
	My spirit can no longer bear these harms.
	Soldiers, adieu! I have what I would have,
	Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave.
