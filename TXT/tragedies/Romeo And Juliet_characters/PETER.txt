	I saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.

	Musicians! O! musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's ease:' O! an ye will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 5><84%>
	O! musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is full of woe;' O! play me some merry dump, to comfort me.

	You will not then?
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 5><84%>
	I will then give it you soundly.

	No money, on my faith! but the gleek;
	I will give you the minstrel.

	Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate, I will carry no crotchets:
	I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do you note me?

	Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men:
	When griping grief the heart doth wound,
	And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
	Then music with her silver soundâ€”
	Why 'silver sound?' why 'music with her silver sound?' What say you, Simon Catling?

	Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 5><85%>
	Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 5><85%>
	O! I cry you mercy; you are the singer;
	I will say for you. It is, 'music with her silver sound,' because musicians have no gold for sounding:
	Then music with her silver sound
	With speedy help doth lend redress.
