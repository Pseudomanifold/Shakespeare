	Of honourable reckoning are you both;
	And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
	But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	Younger than she are happy mothers made.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 4><63%>
	These times of woe afford no time to woo.
	Madam, good-night: commend me to your daughter.

	Monday, my lord.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 4><64%>
	My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	My father Capulet will have it so;
	And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
	And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
	For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
	Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
	That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
	And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
	To stop the inundation of her tears;
	Which, too much minded by herself alone,
	May be put from her by society.
	Now do you know the reason of this haste.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	Happily met, my lady and my wife!
<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
	That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 1><73%>
	Come you to make confession to this father?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 1><73%>
	Do not deny to him that you love me.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 1><73%>
	So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 1><73%>
	Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 1><73%>
	Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 1><73%>
	Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 1><73%>
	God shield, I should disturb devotion!
	Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse you:
	Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 5><82%>
	Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
	And doth it give me such a sight as this?
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 5><83%>
	Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
	Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
	By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
	O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof;
	Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
	Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
	Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground:
	So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
	Being loose, unfirm with digging up of graves,
	But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
	As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
	Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee; go.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,
	O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;
	Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
	Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
	The obsequies that I for thee will keep
	Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
	The boy gives warning something doth approach.
	What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
	To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
	What! with a torch?—muffle me, night, awhile.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
	That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief
	It is supposed the fair creature died;
	And here is come to do some villanous shame
	To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.—
	Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague,
	Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
	Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
	Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
	I do defy thy conjurations,
	And apprehend thee for a felon here.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
	</STAGE DIR> O, I am slain!—If thou be merciful,
	Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
