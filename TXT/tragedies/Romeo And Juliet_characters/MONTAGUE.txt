	Who set this ancient quarrel new a-broach?
	Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

	Many a morning hath he there been seen,
	With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
	Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs:
	But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
	Should in the furthest east begin to draw
	The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
	Away from light steals home my heavy son,
	And private in his chamber pens himself,
	Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
	And makes himself an artificial night.
	Black and portentous must this humour prove
	Unless good-counsel may the cause remove.

	I neither know it nor can learn of him.

	Both by myself and many other friends:
	But he, his own affections' counsellor,
	Is to himself, I will not say how true,
	But to himself so secret and so close,
	So far from sounding and discovery,
	As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
	Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
	Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
	Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
	We would as willingly give cure as know.

	I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,

	Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend,

	Alas! my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
	Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.
	What further woe conspires against mine age?

	O thou untaught! what manners is in this,

	But I can give thee more;
	For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
	That while Verona by that name is known.
	There shall no figure at such rate be set
	As that of true and faithful Juliet.
