	Romans, friends, followers, favourers of my right,
	If ever Bassianus, CÃ¦sar's son,
	Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,
	Keep then this passage to the Capitol,
	And suffer not dishonour to approach
	The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,
	To justice, continence, and nobility;
	But let desert in pure election shine,
	And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.

	Marcus Andronicus, so I do affy
	In thy uprightness and integrity,
	And so I love and honour thee and thine,
	Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,
	And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,
	Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,
	That I will here dismiss my loving friends,
	And to my fortunes and the people's favour
	Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd.

	Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.

	Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,
	But honour thee, and will do till I die:
	My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,
	I will most thankful be; and thanks to men
	Of noble minds is honourable meed.

	Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.

	Ay, noble Titus; and resolv'd withal

	Rape call you it, my lord, to seize my own,

	My lord, what I have done, as best I may,
	Answer I must and shall do with my life.
	Only thus much I give your Grace to know:
	By all the duties that I owe to Rome,
	This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,
	Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd;
	That, in the rescue of Lavinia,
	With his own hand did slay his youngest son,
	In zeal to you and highly mov'd to wrath
	To be controll'd in that he frankly gave:
	Receive him then to favour, Saturnine,
	That hath express'd himself in all his deeds
	A father and a friend to thee and Rome.

	Lavinia, how say you?

	Who have we here? Rome's royal empress,
	Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?
	Or is it Dian, habited like her,
	Who hath abandoned her holy groves,
	To see the general hunting in this forest?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 3><29%>
	Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian
	Doth make your honour of his body's hue,
	Spotted, detested, and abominable.
	Why are you sequester'd from all your train,
	Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed,
	And wander'd hither to an obscure plot,
	Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,
	If foul desire had not conducted you?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 3><29%>
	The king my brother shall have note of this.
