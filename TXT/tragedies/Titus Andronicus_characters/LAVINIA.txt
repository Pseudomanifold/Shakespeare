	In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;
	My noble lord and father, live in fame!
	Lo! at this tomb my tributary tears
	I render for my brethren's obsequies;
	And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy
	Shed on the earth for thy return to Rome.
	O! bless me here with thy victorious hand,
	Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><11%>
	Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
	Warrants these words in princely courtesy.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
	I say, no;
	I have been broad awake two hours and more.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 3><29%>
	Under your patience, gentle empress,
	'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning;
	And to be doubted that your Moor and you
	Are singled forth to try experiments.
	Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!
	'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 3><29%>
	And, being intercepted in your sport,
	Great reason that my noble lord be rated
	For sauciness. I pray you, let us hence,
	And let her joy her raven-colour'd love;
	This valley fits the purpose passing well.

	Ay, for these slips have made him noted long:
	Good king, to be so mightily abus'd!
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
	Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora;
	For no name fits thy nature but thy own.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
	O Tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face,—
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
	Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.

	When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?
	O! do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee;
	The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble;
	Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.
	Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:
	</STAGE DIR> Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.

	'Tis true! the raven doth not hatch a lark:
	Yet have I heard, O! could I find it now,
	The lion mov'd with pity did endure
	To have his princely paws par'd all away.
	Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,
	The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:
	O! be to me, though thy hard heart say no,
	Nothing so kind, but something pitiful.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
	O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake,
	That gave thee life when well he might have slain thee,
	Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
	O Tamora! be call'd a gentle queen,
	And with thine own hands kill me in this place;
	For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long;
	Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
	'Tis present death I beg; and one thing more
	That womanhood denies my tongue to tell.
	O! keep me from their worse than killing lust,
	And tumble me into some loathsome pit,
	Where never man's eye may behold my body:
	Do this, and be a charitable murderer.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
	No grace! no womanhood! Ah, beastly creature,
	The blot and enemy to our general name.
	Confusion fall—
