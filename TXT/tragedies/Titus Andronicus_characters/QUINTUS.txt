	My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes.

	What! art thou fall'n? What subtle hole is this,
	Whose mouth is cover'd with rude-growing briers,
	Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood
	As fresh as morning's dew distill'd on flowers?
	A very fatal place it seems to me.
	Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?

	I am surprised with an uncouth fear;
	A chilling sweat o'erruns my trembling joints:
	My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.

	Aaron is gone; and my compassionate heart
	Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
	The thing whereat it trembles by surmise.
	O! tell me how it is; for ne'er till now
	Was I a child, to fear I know not what.

	Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
	Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good
	I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb
	Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave.
	I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,
	Till thou art here aloft, or I below.
	Thou canst not come to me: I come to thee.
