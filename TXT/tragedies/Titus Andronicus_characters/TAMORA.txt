	Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,
	Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,
	A mother's tears in passion for her son:
	And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,
	O! think my son to be as dear to me.
	Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,
	To beautify thy triumphs and return,
	Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke;
	But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets
	For valiant doings in their country's cause?
	O! if to fight for king and commonweal
	Were piety in thine, it is in these.
	Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood:
	Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?
	Draw near them then in being merciful;
	Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge:
	Thrice-noble Titus, spare my first-born son.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	O cruel, irreligious piety!
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><13%>
	And here, in sight of heaven, to Rome I swear,
	If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths,
	She will a handmaid be to his desires,
	A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><17%>
	My worthy lord, if ever Tamora
	Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,
	Then hear me speak indifferently for all;
	And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><18%>
	Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend
	I should be author to dishonour you!
	But on mine honour dare I undertake
	For good Lord Titus' innocence in all,
	Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs.
	Then, at my suit, look graciously on him;
	Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose,
	Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.
	</STAGE DIR> My lord, be rul'd by me, be won at last;
	Dissemble all your griefs and discontents:
	You are but newly planted in your throne;
	Lest then, the people, and patricians too,
	Upon a just survey, take Titus' part,
	And so supplant you for ingratitude,
	Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,
	Yield at entreats, and then let me alone.
	I'll find a day to massacre them all,
	And raze their faction and their family,
	The cruel father, and his traitorous sons,
	To whom I sued for my dear son's life;
	And make them know what 'tis to let a queen
	Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.
	</STAGE DIR> Come, come, sweet emperor; come, Andronicus;
	Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart
	That dies in tempest of thy angry frown:
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><19%>
	Titus, I am incorporate in Rome,
	A Roman now adopted happily,
	And must advise the emperor for his good.
	This day all quarrels die, Andronicus;
	And let it be mine honour, good my lord,
	That I have reconcil'd your friends and you.
	For you, Prince Bassianus, I have pass'd
	My word and promise to the emperor,
	That you will be more mild and tractable.
	And fear not, lords, and you, Lavinia,
	By my advice, all humbled on your knees,
	You shall ask pardon of his majesty.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><19%>
	Nay, nay, sweet emperor, we must all be friends:
	The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace;
	I will not be denied: sweet heart, look back.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 3><27%>
	My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad,
	When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?
	The birds chant melody on every bush,
	The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,
	The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind,
	And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground.
	Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
	And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,
	Replying shrilly to the well-tun'd horns,
	As if a double hunt were heard at once,
	Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
	And after conflict, such as was suppos'd
	The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd,
	When with a happy storm they were surpris'd,
	And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave,
	We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,
	Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber;
	Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
	Be unto us as is a nurse's song
	Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 3><28%>
	Ah! my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 3><29%>
	Saucy controller of our private steps!
	Had I the power that some say Dian had,
	Thy temples should be planted presently
	With horns, as was Actæon's; and the hounds
	Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,
	Unmannerly intruder as thou art!
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
	Why have I patience to endure all this?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
	Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?
	These two have 'tic'd me hither to this place:
	A barren detested vale, you see, it is;
	The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,
	O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:
	Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
	Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:
	And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,
	They told me, here, at dead time of the night,
	A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
	Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,
	Would make such fearful and confused cries,
	As any mortal body hearing it
	Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.
	No sooner had they told this hellish tale,
	But straight they told me they would bind me here
	Unto the body of a dismal yew,
	And leave me to this miserable death:
	And then they called me foul adulteress,
	Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms
	That ever ear did hear to such effect;
	And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,
	This vengeance on me had they executed.
	Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,
	Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
	Give me thy poniard; you shall know, my boys,
	Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
	But when ye have the honey ye desire,
	Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
	I will not hear her speak; away with her!
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
	I know not what it means; away with her!
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
	Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,
	Even for his sake am I pitiless.
	Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain
	To save your brother from the sacrifice;
	But fierce Andronicus would not relent:
	Therefore, away with her, and use her as you will:
	The worse to her, the better lov'd of me.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
	What begg'st thou then? fond woman, let me go.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
	So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee:
	No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
	Farewell, my sons: see that you make her sure.
	Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed
	Till all the Andronici be made away.
	Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,
	And let my spleenful sons this trull deflower.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	Where is my lord, the king?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	Where is thy brother Bassianus?
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,
	The complot of this timeless tragedy;
	And wonder greatly that man's face can fold
	In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	What! are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!
	How easily murder is discovered!
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	Andronicus himself did take it up.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	Andronicus, I will entreat the king:
	Fear not thy sons, they shall do well enough.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 4><74%>
	My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,
	Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,
	Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,
	The effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,
	Whose loss hath pierc'd him deep and scarr'd his heart;
	And rather comfort his distressed plight
	Than prosecute the meanest or the best
	For these contempts.—<STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Why, thus it shall become
	High-witted Tamora to gloze with all:
	But, Titus, I have touch'd thee to the quick,
	Thy life-blood out: if Aaron now be wise,
	Then is all safe, the anchor's in the port.
	How now, good fellow! wouldst thou speak with us?
<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	Empress I am, but yonder sits the emperor.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
	Come, sirrah, you must be hanged.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
	Why should you fear? is not your city strong?
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
	King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name.
	Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?
	The eagle suffers little birds to sing,
	And is not careful what they mean thereby,
	Knowing that with the shadow of his wings
	He can at pleasure stint their melody;
	Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.
	Then cheer thy spirit; for know, thou emperor,
	I will enchant the old Andronicus
	With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,
	Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,
	Whenas the one is wounded with the bait,
	The other rotted with delicious feed.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 4><77%>
	If Tamora entreat him, then he will:
	For I can smooth and fill his aged ear
	With golden promises, that, were his heart
	Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf,
	Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.
	</STAGE DIR> Go thou before, be our ambassador:
	Say that the emperor requests a parley
	Of war-like Lucius, and appoint the meeting,
	Even at his father's house, the old Andronicus.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 4><77%>
	Now will I to that old Andronicus,
	And temper him with all the art I have,
	To pluck proud Lucius from the war-like Goths.
	And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again,
	And bury all thy fear in my devices.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 2><84%>
	Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,
	I will encounter with Andronicus,
	And say I am Revenge, sent from below
	To join with him and right his heinous wrongs.
	Knock at his study, where, they say, he keeps,
	To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge;
	Tell him, Revenge is come to join with him,
	And work confusion on his enemies.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 2><84%>
	Titus, I am come to talk with thee.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 5><SCENE 2><84%>
	If thou didst know me, thou wouldst talk with me.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
	Know, thou sad man, I am not Tamora;
	She is thy enemy, and I thy friend:
	I am Revenge, sent from the infernal kingdom,
	To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind,
	By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.
	Come down, and welcome me to this world's light;
	Confer with me of murder and of death.
	There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,
	No vast obscurity or misty vale,
	Where bloody murder or detested rape
	Can couch for fear, but I will find them out;
	And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,
	Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
	I am; therefore come down, and welcome me.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 5><SCENE 2><86%>
	These are my ministers, and come with me.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 5><SCENE 2><86%>
	Rapine and Murder; therefore called so,
	Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 5><SCENE 2><86%>
	This closing with him fits his lunacy.
	Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick fits,
	Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,
	For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;
	And, being credulous in this mad thought,
	I'll make him send for Lucius his son;
	And, whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,
	I'll find some cunning practice out of hand
	To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,
	Or, at the least, make them his enemies.
	See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 5><SCENE 2><87%>
	What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?
<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 2><87%>
	Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong,
	And I will be revenged on them all.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
	Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.
	But would it please thee, good Andronicus,
	To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,
	Who leads towards Rome a band of war-like Goths,
	And bid him come and banquet at thy house:
	When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,
	I will bring in the empress and her sons,
	The emperor himself, and all thy foes,
	And at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel,
	And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.
	What says Andronicus to this device?
<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	Now will I hence about thy business,
	And take my ministers along with me.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	</STAGE DIR> What say you, boys? will you abide with him,
	Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor
	How I have govern'd our determin'd jest?
	Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,
	And tarry with him till I turn again.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	Farewell, Andronicus: Revenge now goes
	To lay a complot to betray thy foes.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
	We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
	Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?
