	He is not with himself; let us withdraw.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
	And mine, I promise you: were't not for shame,
	Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.

	O brother! with the dismall'st object hurt
	That ever eye with sight made heart lament.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	Why dost not comfort me, and help me out
	From this unhallow'd and blood-stained hole?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,
	Aaron and thou look down into this den,
	And see a fearful sight of blood and death.

	Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here,
	All on a heap, like to a slaughter'd lamb,
	In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
	A precious ring, that lightens all the hole,
	Which, like a taper in some monument,
	Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,
	And shows the ragged entrails of the pit:
	So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus
	When he by night lay bath'd in maiden blood.
	O brother! help me with thy fainting hand,
	If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath,
	Out of this fell devouring receptacle,
	As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	The unhappy son of old Andronicus;
	Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,
	To find thy brother Bassianus dead.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	We know not where you left him all alive;
	But, out alas! here have we found him dead.
