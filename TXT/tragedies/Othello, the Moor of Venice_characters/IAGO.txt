	Despise me if I do not. Three great ones of the city,
	In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
	Off-capp'd to him; and, by the faith of man.
	I know my price, I am worth no worse a place;
	But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,
	Evades them, with a bombast circumstance
	Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;
	And, in conclusion,
	Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,
	'I have already chose my officer.'
	And what was he?
	Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
	One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,
	A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;
	That never set a squadron in the field,
	Nor the division of a battle knows
	More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
	Wherein the toged consuls can propose
	As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practice,
	Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election;
	And I—of whom his eyes had seen the proof
	At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds
	Christian and heathen—must be be-lee'd and calm'd
	By debitor and creditor; this counter caster,
	He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
	And I—God bless the mark!—his Moorship's ancient.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	Why, there's no remedy: 'tis the curse of the service,
	Preferment goes by letter and affection,

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	O! sir, content you;
	I follow him to serve my turn upon him;
	We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
	Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
	Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,
	That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,
	Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,

	Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
	And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
	Do well thrive by them, and when they have lin'd their coats
	Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;
	And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,
	It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
	Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:
	In following him, I follow but myself;
	Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
	But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
	For when my outward action doth demonstrate

	In compliment extern, 'tis not long after

<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	O! villanous; I have looked upon the world for four times seven years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus, or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners; so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and woed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions; but we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
	It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness; I could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow these wars; defeat thy favour with a usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor,—put money in thy purse,—nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement in her, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration; put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills;—fill thy purse with money:—the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must change for youth: when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have change, she must: therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 1><SCENE 3><20%>
	Thou art sure of me: go, make money. I have told thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I hate the Moor: my cause is hearted: thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him; if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered. Traverse; go: provide thy money. We will have more of this to-morrow. Adieu.

	Thus do I ever make my fool my purse;
	For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,
	If I would time expend with such a snipe
	But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor,
	And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets
	He has done my office: I know not if 't be true,
	But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,
	Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;
	The better shall my purpose work on him.
	Cassio's a proper man; let me see now:
	To get his place; and to plume up my will
	In double knavery; how, how? Let's see:
	After some time to abuse Othello's ear
	That he is too familiar with his wife:
	He hath a person and a smooth dispose
	To be suspected; framed to make women false.
	The Moor is of a free and open nature,
	That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,
	And will as tenderly be led by the nose
	As asses are.
	I have 't; it is engender'd: hell and night
	Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.

If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake! <span class="stage>[A trumpet heard.] The Moor!

	Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come hither. If thou be'st valiant, as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them, list me. The lieutenant to-night watches on the court of guard: first, I must tell thee this, Desdemona is directly in love with him.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
	Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies; and will she love him still for prating? let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame it, and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour, sympathy in years, manners, and beauties; all which the Moor is defective in. Now, for want of these required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will instruct her in it, and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir, this granted, as it is a most pregnant and unforced position, who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? a knave very voluble, no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why, none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a finder-out of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself; a devilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after; a pestilent complete knave! and the woman hath found him already.

	Lechery, by this hand! an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their lips, that their breaths embraced together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main exercise, the incorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night; for the command, I'll lay 't upon you: Cassio knows you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favourably minister.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
	Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the impediment most profitably removed, without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
	I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel: I must fetch his necessaries ashore.
	Farewell.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
	That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
	That she loves him, 'tis apt, and of great credit:
	The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,
	Is of a constant, loving, noble nature;
	And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona
	A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;
	Not out of absolute lust,—though peradventure
	I stand accountant for as great a sin,—
	But partly led to diet my revenge,
	For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
	Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof
	Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards;
	And nothing can or shall content my soul
	Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife;
	Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
	At least into a jealousy so strong
	That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,
	If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
	For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,
	I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip;
	Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb,
	For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too,
	Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me
	For making him egregiously an ass
	And practising upon his peace and quiet
	Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confus'd:
	Knavery's plain face is never seen till us'd.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
	Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona, who let us not therefore blame; he hath not yet made wanton the night with her, and she is sport for Jove.

	Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,

	Montano and myself being in speech,
	There comes a fellow crying out for he'p,
	And Cassio following with determin'd sword
	To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman
	Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause;
	Myself the crying fellow did pursue,
	Lest by his clamour, as it so fell out,
	The town might fall in fright; he, swift of foot,
	Outran my purpose, and I return'd the rather
	For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
	And Cassio high in oath, which till to-night
	I ne'er might say before. When I came back,—
	For this was brief,—I found them close together,
	At blow and thrust, even as again they were
	When you yourself did part them.
	More of this matter can I not report:
	But men are men; the best sometimes forget:
	Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,
	As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
	Yet, surely Cassio, I believe, receiv'd
	From him that fled some strange indignity,
	Which patience could not pass.
<SPEECH 80><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	What! are you hurt, lieutenant?
<SPEECH 81><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
	Marry, heaven forbid!
<SPEECH 82><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
	As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound; there is more offence in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without merit, and lost without deserving: you have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What! man; there are ways to recover the general again; you are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice; even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion. Sue to him again, and he is yours.
<SPEECH 83><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
	What was he that you followed with your sword? What had he done to you?
<SPEECH 84><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
	Is 't possible?
<SPEECH 85><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
	Why, but you are now well enough; how came you thus recovered?
<SPEECH 86><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
	Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place, and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen, but since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.
<SPEECH 87><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
	Come, come; good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used; exclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.
<SPEECH 88><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
	You or any man living may be drunk at some time, man. I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife is now the general: I may say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune her; she'll help to put you in your place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, that she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested. This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.
<SPEECH 89><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
	I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.
<SPEECH 90><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
	You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I must to the watch.
<SPEECH 91><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
	And what's he then that says I play the villain?
	When this advice is free I give and honest,
	Probal to thinking and indeed the course
	To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
	The inclining Desdemona to subdue
	In any honest suit; she's fram'd as fruitful
	As the free elements. And then for her
	To win the Moor, were 't to renounce his baptism,
	All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
	His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
	That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
	Even as her appetite shall play the god
	With his weak function. How am I then a villain
	To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
	Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
	When devils will the blackest sins put on,
	They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
	As I do now; for while this honest fool
	Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes,
	And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
	I'll pour this pestilence into his ear
	That she repeals him for her body's lust;
	And, by how much she strives to do him good,
	She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
	So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
	And out of her own goodness make the net
	That shall enmesh them all.
	How now, Roderigo!
<SPEECH 92><ACT 2><SCENE 3><42%>
	How poor are they that have not patience!
	What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
	Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,
	And wit depends on dilatory time.
	Does 't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,
	And thou by that small hurt hast cashiered Cassio.
	Though other things grow fair against the sun,
	Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:
	Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
	Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
	Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:
	Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:
	Nay, get thee gone. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Two things are to be done,
	My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;
	I'll set her on;
	Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
	And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
	Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way:
	Dull not device by coldness and delay.
<SPEECH 93><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	You have not been a-bed, then?
<SPEECH 94><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
	I'll send her to you presently;
	And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor
	Out of the way, that your converse and business
	May be more free.
<SPEECH 95><ACT 3><SCENE 2><44%>
	Well, my good lord, I'll do t.
<SPEECH 96><ACT 3><SCENE 3><45%>
	Ha! I like not that.
<SPEECH 97><ACT 3><SCENE 3><46%>
	Nothing, my lord: or if—I know not what.
<SPEECH 98><ACT 3><SCENE 3><46%>
	Cassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it

	Seeing you coming.
<SPEECH 99><ACT 3><SCENE 3><47%>
	My noble lord,—
<SPEECH 100><ACT 3><SCENE 3><47%>
	Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
	Know of your love?
<SPEECH 101><ACT 3><SCENE 3><47%>
	But for a satisfaction of my thought;
	No further harm.
<SPEECH 102><ACT 3><SCENE 3><47%>
	I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
<SPEECH 103><ACT 3><SCENE 3><47%>
	Indeed!
<SPEECH 104><ACT 3><SCENE 3><48%>
	Honest, my lord?
<SPEECH 105><ACT 3><SCENE 3><48%>
	My lord, for aught I know.
<SPEECH 106><ACT 3><SCENE 3><48%>
	Think, my lord!
<SPEECH 107><ACT 3><SCENE 3><48%>
	My lord, you know I love you.
<SPEECH 108><ACT 3><SCENE 3><48%>
	For Michael Cassio,
	I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.
<SPEECH 109><ACT 3><SCENE 3><48%>
	Men should be what they seem;
	Or those that be not, would they might seem none!
<SPEECH 110><ACT 3><SCENE 3><48%>
	Why then, I think Cassio 's an honest man.
<SPEECH 111><ACT 3><SCENE 3><48%>
	Good my lord, pardon me;
	Though I am bound to every act of duty,
	I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
	Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;
	As where's that palace whereinto foul things
	Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure
	But some uncleanly apprehensions
	Keep leets and law days, and in session sit
	With meditations lawful?
<SPEECH 112><ACT 3><SCENE 3><49%>
	I do beseech you,
	Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,—
	As, I confess, it is my nature's plague
	To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
	Shapes faults that are not,—that your wisdom yet,
	From one that so imperfectly conceits,
	Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
	Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
	It were not for your quiet nor your good,
	Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,
	To let you know my thoughts.
<SPEECH 113><ACT 3><SCENE 3><49%>
	Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
	Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
	Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
	'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;
	But he that filches from me my good name
	Robs me of that which not enriches him,
	And makes me poor indeed.
<SPEECH 114><ACT 3><SCENE 3><49%>
	You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
	Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.
<SPEECH 115><ACT 3><SCENE 3><49%>
	O! beware, my lord, of jealousy;
	It is the green-ey'd monster which doth mock
	The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss
	Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
	But, O! what damned minutes tells he o'er
	Who dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet soundly loves!
<SPEECH 116><ACT 3><SCENE 3><50%>
	Poor and content is rich, and rich enough,
	But riches fineless is as poor as winter
	To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
	Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend
	From jealousy!
<SPEECH 117><ACT 3><SCENE 3><50%>
	I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason
	To show the love and duty that I bear you
	With franker spirit; therefore, as I am bound,
	Receive it from me; I speak not yet of proof.
	Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
	Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:
	I would not have your free and noble nature
	Out of self-bounty be abus'd; look to 't:
	I know our country disposition well;
	In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
	They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience
	Is not to leave 't undone, but keep 't unknown.
<SPEECH 118><ACT 3><SCENE 3><51%>
	She did deceive her father, marrying you:
	And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
	She lov'd them most.
<SPEECH 119><ACT 3><SCENE 3><51%>
	Why, go to, then;
	She that so young could give out such a seeming,
	To seel her father's eyes up close as oak,
	He thought 'twas witchcraft; but I am much to blame;
	I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
	For too much loving you.
<SPEECH 120><ACT 3><SCENE 3><51%>
	I see, this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
<SPEECH 121><ACT 3><SCENE 3><51%>
	I' faith, I fear it has.
	I hope you will consider what is spoke
	Comes from my love. But, I do see you're mov'd;
	I am to pray you not to strain my speech
	To grosser issues nor to larger reach
	Than to suspicion.
<SPEECH 122><ACT 3><SCENE 3><51%>
	Should you do so, my lord,
	My speech should fall into such vile success
	As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend—
	My lord, I see you're mov'd.
<SPEECH 123><ACT 3><SCENE 3><51%>
	Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
<SPEECH 124><ACT 3><SCENE 3><51%>
	Ay, there's the point: as, to be bold with you,
	Not to affect many proposed matches
	Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
	Whereto, we see, in all things nature tends;
	Foh! one may smell in such, a will most rank,
	Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural.
	But pardon me; I do not in position
	Distinctly speak of her, though I may fear
	Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,
	May fail to match you with her country forms
	And happily repent.
<SPEECH 125><ACT 3><SCENE 3><52%>
	My lord, I take my leave.
<SPEECH 126><ACT 3><SCENE 3><52%>
	</STAGE DIR> My lord, I would I might entreat your honour
	To scan this thing no further; leave it to time.
	Although 'tis fit that Cassio have his place,
	For, sure he fills it up with great ability,
	Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,
	You shall by that perceive him and his means:
	Note if your lady strain his entertainment
	With any strong or vehement importunity;
	Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,
	Let me be thought too busy in my fears,
	As worthy cause I have to fear I am,
	And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.
<SPEECH 127><ACT 3><SCENE 3><52%>
	I once more take my leave.
<SPEECH 128><ACT 3><SCENE 3><53%>
	How now! what do you here alone?
<SPEECH 129><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
	A thing for me? It is a common thing—
<SPEECH 130><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
	To have a foolish wife.
<SPEECH 131><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
	What handkerchief?
<SPEECH 132><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
	Hast stol'n it from her?
<SPEECH 133><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
	A good wench; give it me.
<SPEECH 134><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
	Why, what's that to you?
<SPEECH 135><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
	Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.
	Go, leave me.
	I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
	And let him find it; trifles light as air
	Are to the jealous confirmations strong
	As proofs of holy writ; this may do something.
	The Moor already changes with my poison:
	Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,
	Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
	But with a little act upon the blood,
	Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so:
	Look! where he comes!
	Not poppy, nor mandragora,
	Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,
	Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
	Which thou ow'dst yesterday.
<SPEECH 136><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
	Why, how now, generall no more of that.
<SPEECH 137><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
	How now, my lord!
<SPEECH 138><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
	I am sorry to hear this.
<SPEECH 139><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
	Is it possible, my lord?
<SPEECH 140><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
	Is 't come to this?
<SPEECH 141><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
	My noble lord,—
<SPEECH 142><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
	O grace! O heaven forgive me!
	Are you a man! have you a soul or sense?
	God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool!
	That liv'st to make thine honesty a vice.
	O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world!
	To be direct and honest is not safe.
	I thank you for this profit, and, from hence
	I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.
<SPEECH 143><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
	I should be wise; for honesty's a fool,
	And loses that it works for.
<SPEECH 144><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
	I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion.
	I do repent me that I put it to you.
	You would be satisfied?
<SPEECH 145><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
	And may; but how? how satisfied, my lord?
	Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on;
	Behold her tupp'd?
<SPEECH 146><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
	It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
	To bring them to that prospect; damn them then,
	If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
	More than their own! What then? how then?
	What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?
	It is impossible you should see this,
	Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
	As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
	As ignorance made drunk; but yet, I say,
	If imputation, and strong circumstances,
	Which lead directly to the door of truth,
	Will give you satisfaction, you may have it.
<SPEECH 147><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
	I do not like the office;
	But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,
	Prick'd to 't by foolish honesty and love,
	I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;
	And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
	I could not sleep.
	There are a kind of men so loose of soul
	That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs;
	One of this kind is Cassio.
	In sleep I heard him say, 'Sweet Desdemona,
	Let us be wary, let us hide our loves!'
	And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
	Cry, 'O, sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,
	As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots,
	That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg
	Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then
	Cried, 'Cursed fate, that gave thee to the Moor!'
<SPEECH 148><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
	Nay, this was but his dream.
<SPEECH 149><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
	And this may help to thicken other proofs
	That do demonstrate thinly.
<SPEECH 150><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
	Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done;
	She may be honest yet. Tell me but this:
	Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
	Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?
<SPEECH 151><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
	I know not that; but such a handkerchief—
	I am sure it was your wife's—did I to-day
	See Cassio wipe his beard with.
<SPEECH 152><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
	If it be that, or any that was hers,
	It speaks against her with the other proofs.
<SPEECH 153><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
	Yet be content.
<SPEECH 154><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
	Patience, I say; your mind, perhaps, may change.
<SPEECH 155><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
	Do not rise yet.
	Witness, you ever-burning lights above!
	You elements that clip us round about!
	Witness, that here Iago doth give up
	The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
	To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,
	And to obey shall be in me remorse,
	What bloody business ever.
<SPEECH 156><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:
	But let her live.
<SPEECH 157><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
	I am your own for ever.
<SPEECH 158><ACT 3><SCENE 4><62%>
	There is no other way; 'tis she must do 't:
	And, lo! the happiness: go and importune her.
<SPEECH 159><ACT 3><SCENE 4><63%>
	Is my lord angry?
<SPEECH 160><ACT 3><SCENE 4><63%>
	Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,
	When it hath blown his ranks into the air,
	And, like the devil, from his very arm
	Puff'd his own brother; and can he be angry?
	Something of moment then; I will go meet him;
	There's matter in 't indeed, if he be angry.
<SPEECH 161><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	Will you think so?
<SPEECH 162><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	What!
	To kiss in private?
<SPEECH 163><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	Or to be naked with her friend a-bed
	An hour or more, not meaning any harm?
<SPEECH 164><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	If they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip;
	But if I give my wife a handkerchief,—
<SPEECH 165><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,
	She may, I think, bestow 't on any man.
<SPEECH 166><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	Her honour is an essence that's not seen;
	They have it very oft that have it not:
	But for the handkerchief,—
<SPEECH 167><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	Ay, what of that?
<SPEECH 168><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
	What,
	If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
	Or heard him say, as knaves be such abroad,
	Who having, by their own importunate suit,
	Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,
	Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose
	But they must blab.
<SPEECH 169><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
	He hath, my lord; but be you well assur'd,
	No more than he'll unswear.
<SPEECH 170><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
	Faith, that he did—I know not what he did.
<SPEECH 171><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
	Lie—

	With her, on her; what you will.

	Work on,

	How now, Cassio!
<SPEECH 174><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
	My lord is fallen into an epilepsy;
	This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.
<SPEECH 175><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
	No, forbear;
	The lethargy must have his quiet course,
	If not he foams at mouth, and by and by
	Breaks out to savage madness. Look! he stirs;
	Do you withdraw yourself a little while,
	He will recover straight; when he is gone,
	I would on great occasion speak with you.
	How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?
<SPEECH 176><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
	I mock you! no, by heaven.
	Would you would bear your fortune like a man!
<SPEECH 177><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
	There's many a beast then, in a populous city,
	And many a civil monster.
<SPEECH 178><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
	Good sir, be a man;
	Think every bearded fellow that's but yok'd
	May draw with you; there's millions now alive
	That nightly lie in those unproper beds
	Which they dare swear peculiar; your case is better.
	O! 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,
	To lip a wanton in a secure couch,
	And to suppose her chaste. No, let me know;
	And knowing what I am I know what she shall be.
<SPEECH 179><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
	Stand you awhile apart;
	Confine yourself but in a patient list.
	Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief,—
	A passion most unsuiting such a man,—
	Cassio came hither; I shifted him away,
	And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy;
	Bade him anon return and here speak with me;
	The which he promis'd. Do but encave yourself,
	And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,
	That dwell in every region of his face;
	For I will make him tell the tale anew,
	Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
	He hath, and is again to cope your wife:
	I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;
	Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,
	And nothing of a man.
<SPEECH 180><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
	That's not amiss;
	But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
	Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
	A housewife that by selling her desires
	Buys herself bread and clothes; it is a creature
	That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague
	To beguile many and be beguil'd by one.
	He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
	From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:
	As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;
	And his unbookish jealousy must construe
	Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures, and light behaviour
	Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?
<SPEECH 181><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
	Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on 't.
	</STAGE DIR> Now, if this suit lay in Bianca's power,
	How quickly should you speed!
<SPEECH 182><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
	I never knew woman love man so.
<SPEECH 183><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
	Do you hear, Cassio?
<SPEECH 184><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
	She gives it out that you shall marry her;
	Do you intend it?
<SPEECH 185><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
	Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.
<SPEECH 186><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
	I am a very villain else.
<SPEECH 187><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
	Before me! look, where she comes.
<SPEECH 188><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	After her, after her.
<SPEECH 189><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	Will you sup there?
<SPEECH 190><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak with you.
<SPEECH 191><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	Go to; say no more.
<SPEECH 192><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
<SPEECH 193><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	And did you see the handkerchief?
<SPEECH 194><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	Yours, by this hand; and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.
<SPEECH 195><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	Nay, you must forget that.
<SPEECH 196><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	Nay, that's not your way.
<SPEECH 197><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	She's the worse for all this.
<SPEECH 198><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
	Ay, too gentle.
<SPEECH 199><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes near nobody.
<SPEECH 200><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	O! 'tis foul in her.
<SPEECH 201><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	That's fouler.
<SPEECH 202><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminated.
<SPEECH 203><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker; you shall hear more by midnight.
<SPEECH 204><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico,
	Come from the duke; and see, your wife is with him.
<SPEECH 205><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	I am very glad to see you, signior;
	Welcome to Cyprus.
<SPEECH 206><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
	Lives, sir.
<SPEECH 207><ACT 4><SCENE 1><73%>
	He is much chang'd.
<SPEECH 208><ACT 4><SCENE 1><73%>
	He's that he is; I may not breathe my censure.
	What he might be, if, what he might, he is not,
	I would to heaven he were!
<SPEECH 209><ACT 4><SCENE 1><73%>
	Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew
	That stroke would prove the worst!
<SPEECH 210><ACT 4><SCENE 1><73%>
	Alas, alas!
	It is not honesty in me to speak
	What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,
	And his own courses will denote him so
	That I may save my speech. Do but go after
	And mark how he continues.
<SPEECH 211><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
	What is your pleasure, madam? How is it with you?
<SPEECH 212><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
	What's the matter, lady?
<SPEECH 213><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
	What name, fair lady?
<SPEECH 214><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
	Why did he so?
<SPEECH 215><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
	Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!
<SPEECH 216><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
	Beshrew him for it!
	How comes this trick upon him?
<SPEECH 217><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
	Fie! there is no such man; it is impossible.
<SPEECH 218><ACT 4><SCENE 2><78%>
	Speak within door.
<SPEECH 219><ACT 4><SCENE 2><78%>
	You are a fool; go to.
<SPEECH 220><ACT 4><SCENE 2><78%>
	I pray you be content, 'tis but his humour;
	The business of the state does him offence,
	And he does chide with you.
<SPEECH 221><ACT 4><SCENE 2><78%>
	'Tis but so, I warrant.
	Hark! how these instruments summon to supper;
	The messengers of Venice stay the meat:
	Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
	How now, Roderigo!
<SPEECH 222><ACT 4><SCENE 2><79%>
	What in the contrary?
<SPEECH 223><ACT 4><SCENE 2><79%>
	Will you hear me, Roderigo?
<SPEECH 224><ACT 4><SCENE 2><79%>
	You charge me most unjustly.
<SPEECH 225><ACT 4><SCENE 2><79%>
	Well; go to; very well.
<SPEECH 226><ACT 4><SCENE 2><79%>
	Very well.
<SPEECH 227><ACT 4><SCENE 2><79%>
	You have said now.
<SPEECH 228><ACT 4><SCENE 2><80%>
	Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo; thou hast taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.
<SPEECH 229><ACT 4><SCENE 2><80%>
	I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean purpose, courage, and valour, this night show it: if thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life.
<SPEECH 230><ACT 4><SCENE 2><80%>
	Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place.
<SPEECH 231><ACT 4><SCENE 2><80%>
	O, no! he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some accident; wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.
<SPEECH 232><ACT 4><SCENE 2><80%>
	Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; knocking out his brains.
<SPEECH 233><ACT 4><SCENE 2><80%>
	Ay; if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him; he knows not yet of his honourable fortune. If you will watch his going thence,—which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,—you may take him at your pleasure; I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high supper-time, and the night grows to waste; about it.
<SPEECH 234><ACT 4><SCENE 2><81%>
	And you shall be satisfied.
<SPEECH 235><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:
	Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home.
	Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow.
	It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,
	And fix most firm thy resolution.
<SPEECH 236><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.
<SPEECH 237><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
	I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
	And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
	Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
	Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,
	He calls me to a restitution large
	Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
	As gifts to Desdemona;
	It must not be: if Cassio do remain,
	He hath a daily beauty in his life
	That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor
	May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril.
	No, he must die. But so; I hear him coming.
<SPEECH 238><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	Who's there? whose noise is this that cries on murder?
<SPEECH 239><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	Did not you hear a cry?
<SPEECH 240><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	What's the matter?
<SPEECH 241><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	What are you here that cry so grievously?
<SPEECH 242><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this?
<SPEECH 243><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	O treacherous villains!
	</STAGE DIR> What are you there? come in, and give some help.
<SPEECH 244><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	O murderous slave! O villain!
<SPEECH 245><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	Kill men i' the dark! Where be these bloody thieves?
	How silent is this town! Ho! murder! murder!
	What may you be? are you of good or evil?
<SPEECH 246><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	Signior Lodovico?
<SPEECH 247><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
<SPEECH 248><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	How is it, brother?
<SPEECH 249><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Marry, heaven forbid,
	Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.
<SPEECH 250><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Who is 't that cried!
<SPEECH 251><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
	Who they should be that have thus mangled you?
<SPEECH 252><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Lend me a garter. So. O! for a chair,
	To bear him easily hence!
<SPEECH 253><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
	To be a party in this injury.
	Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come.
	Lend me a light. Know we this face, or no?
	Alas! my friend and my dear countryman,
	Roderigo? no: yes, sure, O heaven! Roderigo.
<SPEECH 254><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Even he, sir: did you know him?
<SPEECH 255><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;
	These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,
	That so neglected you.
<SPEECH 256><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	How do you, Cassio? O! a chair, a chair!
<SPEECH 257><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
	He, he, 'tis he.—O! that's well said; the chair:
	Some good men bear him carefully from hence;
	I'll fetch the general's surgeon. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> For you, mistress,
	Save you your labour. He that lies slain here, Cassio,
	Was my dear friend. What malice was between you?
<SPEECH 258><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	</STAGE DIR> What! look you pale? O! bear him out o' the air—
	Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?—
	Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
	Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
	Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her:
	Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak
	Though tongues were out of use.
<SPEECH 259><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
	By Roderigo and fellows that are 'scap'd:
	He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.
<SPEECH 260><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,
	Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.
	What! do you shake at that?
<SPEECH 261><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	O! did he so? I charge you, go with me.
<SPEECH 262><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.
	Come, mistress, you must tell 's another tale.
	Emilia, run you to the citadel,
	And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.
	Will you go on afore? <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> This is the night
	That either makes me or fordoes me quite.
<SPEECH 263><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	I told him what I thought, and told no more
	Than what he found himself was apt and true.
<SPEECH 264><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	I did.
<SPEECH 265><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.
<SPEECH 266><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	What! are you mad? I charge you, get you home.
<SPEECH 267><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	Come, hold your peace.
<SPEECH 268><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	Be wise, and get you home.
<SPEECH 269><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
	Villanous whore!
<SPEECH 270><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
	Filth, thou liest!
<SPEECH 271><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
	I bleed, sir; but not kill'd.
<SPEECH 272><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
	Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:
	From this time forth I never will speak word.
