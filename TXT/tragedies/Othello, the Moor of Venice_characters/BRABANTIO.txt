	What is the reason of this terrible summons?
	What is the matter there?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Why? wherefore ask you this?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	What! have you lost your wits?
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	Not I, what are you?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	The worser welcome:
	I have charg'd thee not to haunt about my doors:
	In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
	My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,
	Being full of supper and distempering draughts,
	Upon malicious knavery dost thou come
	To start my quiet.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	But thou must needs be sure
	My spirit and my place have in them power
	To make this bitter to thee.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
	What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;
	My house is not a grange.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	What profane wretch art thou?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Thou art a villain.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Strike on the tinder, ho!
	Give me a taper! call up all my people!
	This accident is not unlike my dream;
	Belief of it oppresses me already.
	Light, I say! light!
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	It is too true an evil: gone she is,
	And what's to come of my despised time
	Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,
	Where didst thou see her? O, unhappy girl!
	With the Moor, sayst thou? Who would be a father!
	How didst thou know 'twas she? O, she deceives me
	Past thought. What said she to you? Get more tapers!
	Raise all my kindred! Are they married, think you?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	O heaven! How got she out? O, treason of the blood:
	Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds
	By what you see them act. Are there not charms
	By which the property of youth and maidhood
	May be abus'd? Have you not read, Roderigo,
	Of some such thing?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	Call up my brother. O! that you had had her.
	Some one way, some another! Do you know
	Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
	Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;
	I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!
	And raise some special officers of night.
	On, good Roderigo; I'll deserve your pains.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	Down with him, thief!
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
	O thou foul thief! where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
	Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;
	For I'll refer me to all things of sense,
	If she in chains of magic were not bound,
	Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,
	So opposite to marriage that she shunn'd
	The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,
	Would ever have, to incur a general mock,
	Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
	Of such a thing as thou; to fear, not to delight.
	Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
	That thou hast practis'd on her with foul charms,
	Abus'd her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
	That weaken motion: I'll have 't disputed on;
	'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.
	I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
	For an abuser of the world, a practiser
	Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.
	Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
	Subdue him at his peril.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	To prison; till fit time
	Of law and course of direct session
	Call thee to answer.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	How! the duke in council!
	In this time of the night! Bring him away.
	Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,
	Or any of my brothers of the state,
	Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;
	For if such actions may have passage free,
	Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 3><11%>
	So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;
	Neither my place nor aught I heard of business
	Hath rais'd me from my bed, nor doth the general care
	Take hold of me, for my particular grief
	Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature
	That it engluts and swallows other sorrows
	And it is still itself.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 3><11%>
	My daughter! O! my daughter.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 3><11%>
	Ay, to me;
	She is abus'd, stol'n from me, and corrupted
	By spells and medicines bought of mounte-banks;
	For nature so preposterously to err,
	Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,
	Sans witchcraft could not.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 3><11%>
	Humbly I thank your Grace.
	Here is the man, this Moor; whom now, it seems,
	Your special mandate for the state affairs,
	Hath hither brought.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 3><11%>
	Nothing, but this is so.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
	A maiden never bold;
	Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion
	Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,
	Of years, of country, credit, every thing,
	To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!
	It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect
	That will confess perfection so could err
	Against all rules of nature, and must be driven
	To find out practices of cunning hell,
	Why this should be. I therefore vouch again
	That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,
	Or with some dram conjur'd to this effect,
	He wrought upon her.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
	I pray you, hear her speak:
	If she confess that she was half the wooer,
	Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
	Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:
	Do you perceive in all this noble company
	Where most you owe obedience?
<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	God be with you! I have done.
	Please it your Grace, on to the state affairs:
	I had rather to adopt a child than get it.
	Come hither, Moor:
	I here do give thee that with all my heart
	Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart
	I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,
	I am glad at soul I have no other child;
	For thy escape would teach me tyranny,
	To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
	We lose it not so long as we can smile.
	He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
	But the free comfort which from thence he hears;
	But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
	That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.
	These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,
	Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:
	But words are words; I never yet did hear
	That the bruis'd heart was pierced through the ear.
	I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	I'll not have it so.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
	Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:
	She has deceiv'd her father, and may thee.
