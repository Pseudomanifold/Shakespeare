	News, lads! our wars are done.
	The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks
	That their designment halts; a noble ship of Venice
	Hath seen a grievous wrack and sufferance
	On most part of their fleet.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	The ship is here put in,
	A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,
	Lieutenant to the war-like Moor Othello,
	Is come on shore: the Moor himself's at sea,
	And is in full commission here for Cyprus.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort
	Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly
	And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted
	With foul and violent tempest.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	Come, let's do so;
	For every minute is expectancy
	Of more arrivance.
