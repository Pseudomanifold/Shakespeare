	What from the cape can you discern at sea?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
	Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;
	A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements;
	If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,
	What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,
	Can hold the mortise? what shall we hear of this?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
	If that the Turkish fleet
	Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd;
	It is impossible they bear it out.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	How! is this true?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	I am glad on 't; 'tis a worthy governor.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	Pray heaven he be;
	For I have serv'd him, and the man commands
	Like a full soldier. Let's to the sea-side, ho!
	As well to see the vessel that's come in
	As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,
	Even till we make the main and the aerial blue
	An indistinct regard.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
	Is he well shipp'd?
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	But, good lieutenant, is your general wiv'd?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
	What is she?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
	Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am a soldier.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
	I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
	To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
	But is he often thus?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	It were well
	The general were put in mind of it.
	Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature
	Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,
	And looks not on his evils. Is not this true?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor
	Should hazard such a place as his own second
	With one of an ingraft infirmity;
	It were an honest action to say
	So to the Moor.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	What's the matter, lieutenant?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	</STAGE DIR> Nay, good lieutenant;
	I pray you, sir, hold your hand.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
	Come, come; you're drunk.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
	'Zounds! I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger;
	Your officer, Iago, can inform you,
	While I spare speech, which something now offends me,
	Of all that I do know; nor know I aught
	By me that's said or done amiss this night,
	Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,
	And to defend ourselves it be a sin
	When violence assails us.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
	If partially affin'd, or leagu'd in office,
	Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,
	Thou art no soldier.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	What is the matter? How now, general!
<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	O monstrous act!
<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
	'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,
	Which I have here recover'd from the Moor.
	Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,
	But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,
	For 'tis a damned slave.
