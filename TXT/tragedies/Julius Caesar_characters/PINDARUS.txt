	Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
	Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord:
	Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.

	Titinius is enclosed round about
	With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;
	Yet he spurs on: now they are almost on him;
	Now, Titinius! now some light; O! he lights too:
	He's ta'en; <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> and, hark! they shout for joy.

	So, I am free; yet would not so have been;
	Durst I have done my will. O Cassius,
	Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
	Where never Roman shall take note of him.
