	Cæsar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius; come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna; trust not Trebonius; mark well Metellus Cimber; Decius Brutus loves thee not; thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius. There is but one mind in all these men, and it is bent against Cæsar. If thou be'st not immortal, look about you: security gives way to conspiracy. The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover,
	<ARTEMIDORUS.>Here will I stand till Cæsar pass along,
	And as a suitor will I give him this.
	My heart laments that virtue cannot live
	Out of the teeth of emulation.
	If thou read this, O Cæsar! thou mayst live;
	If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.

	O Cæsar! read mine first; for mine's a suit
	That touches Cæsar nearer. Read it, great Cæsar.

	Delay not, Cæsar; read it instantly.
