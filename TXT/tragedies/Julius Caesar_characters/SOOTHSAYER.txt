	Beware the ides of March.

	At mine own house, good lady.

	About the ninth hour, lady.

	Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand,
	To see him pass on to the Capitol.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 4><42%>
	That I have, lady: if it will please Cæsar
	To be so good to Cæsar as to hear me,
	I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 4><43%>
	None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
	Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow:
	The throng that follows Cæsar at the heels,
	Of senators, of prætors, common suitors,
	Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:
	I'll get me to a place more void, and there
	Speak to great Cæsar as he comes along.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	Ay, Cæsar; but not gone.
