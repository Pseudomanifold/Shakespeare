	To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 3><21%>
	I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!
	There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><21%>
	Yes, you are.
	O Cassius! if you could
	But win the noble Brutus to our party—
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><22%>
	All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone
	To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,
	And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
	O! pardon, sir, it doth; and yon grey lines
	That fret the clouds are messengers of day.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
	No, by no means.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><31%>
	Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.

	O Cæsar,—
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!
	Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 3><66%>
	I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Cæsar,
	And things unlucky charge my fantasy:
	I have no will to wander forth of doors,
	Yet something leads me forth.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 3><67%>
	What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell? Am I a married man, or a bachelor? Then, to answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 3><67%>
	Directly, I am going to Cæsar's funeral.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 3><67%>
	As a friend.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 3><67%>
	Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 3><67%>
	Truly, my name is Cinna.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 3><67%>
	I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 3><67%>
	I am not Cinna the conspirator.
