	I must not think there are
	Evils enow to darken all his goodness;
	His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,
	More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary
	Rather than purchas'd; what he cannot change
	Than what he chooses.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 4><13%>
	Here's more news.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 4><14%>
	'Tis pity of him.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 4><14%>
	To-morrow, Cæsar,
	I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
	Both what by sea and land I can be able
	To front this present time.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 4><14%>
	Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime
	Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
	To let me be partaker.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 2><18%>
	Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
	And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
	To soft and gentle speech.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 2><19%>
	'Tis not a time
	For private stomaching.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><19%>
	But small to greater matters must give way.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><19%>
	Your speech is passion;
	But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes
	The noble Antony.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 2><19%>
	Noble friends,
	That which combin'd us was most great, and let not
	A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
	May it be gently heard; when we debate
	Our trivial difference loud, we do commit
	Murder in healing wounds; then, noble partners,—
	The rather for I earnestly beseech,—
	Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
	Nor curstness grow to the matter.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 2><21%>
	Soft, Cæsar!
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 2><21%>
	'Tis noble spoken.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 2><21%>
	Worthily spoken, Mecænas.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 2><23%>
	Happily, amen!
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 2><23%>
	Time calls upon 's:
	Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
	Or else he seeks out us.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 2><23%>
	Noble Antony,
	Not sickness should detain me.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 4><27%>
	Trouble yourselves no further; pray you hasten
	Your generals after.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 4><27%>
	Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
	Which will become you both, farewell.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 4><27%>
	Your way is shorter;
	My purposes to draw me much about:
	You 'll win two days upon me.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 4><27%>
	Farewell.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 6><33%>
	Be pleas'd to tell us—
	For this is from the present—how you take
	The offers we have sent you.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 6><33%>
	That's our offer.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 6><33%>
	Well met here.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
	Show us the way, sir.

	You've strange serpents there.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 7><37%>
	Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun; so is your crocodile.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 7><37%>
	I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 7><37%>
	Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are very goodly things; without contradiction, I have heard that.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 7><37%>
	What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 7><37%>
	What colour is it of?
<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 7><37%>
	'Tis a strange serpent.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 2><44%>
	Let all the number of the stars give light
	To thy fair way!
