<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	Nay, hear them, Antony:
	Fulvia, perchance, is angry; or, who knows
	If the scarce-bearded Cæsar have not sent
	His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;
	Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;
	Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
	Perchance! nay, and most like;
	You must not stay here longer; your dismission
	Is come from Cæsar; therefore hear it, Antony.
	Where's Fulvia's process? Cæsar's I would say? both?
	Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,
	Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine
	Is Cæsar's homager; else so thy cheek pays shame
	When shrill-tongu'd Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Excellent falsehood!
	Why did he marry Fulvia and not love her?
	I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony

<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 3><9%>
	I know, by that same eye, there's some good news.

	I have no power upon you; hers you are.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 3><9%>
	O! never was there queen

<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 3><9%>
	Why should I think you can be mine and true,
	Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,

<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 3><9%>
	Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,
	But bid farewell, and go: when you su'd staying
	Then was the time for words; no going then:
	Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
	Bliss in our brows bent; none our parts so poor
	But was a race of heaven; they are so still,
	Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
	Art turn'd the greatest liar.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 3><10%>

	Cut my lace, Charmian, come;
	But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well;
	So Antony loves.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 3><11%>
	So Fulvia told me.
	I prithee, turn aside and weep for her;
	Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears

	Like perfect honour.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 1><SCENE 3><11%>
	You can do better yet, but this is meetly.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 1><SCENE 3><11%>
	And target. Still he mends;

<SPEECH 30><ACT 1><SCENE 3><11%>
	Courteous lord, one word.
	Sir, you and I must part, but that 's not it:
	Sir, you and I have lov'd, but there 's not it;
	That you know well: something it is I would,—
	O! my oblivion is a very Antony,
	And I am all forgotten.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 1><SCENE 3><11%>
	'Tis sweating labour
	To bear such idleness so near the heart
	As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;

	Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,
	And all the gods go with you! Upon your sword

	Be strew'd before your feet!
<SPEECH 32><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
	O! 'tis treason.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
	Thou, eunuch Mardian!
<SPEECH 37><ACT 1><SCENE 5><15%>
	Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure

<SPEECH 38><ACT 1><SCENE 5><15%>
	Indeed!
<SPEECH 39><ACT 1><SCENE 5><15%>
	O Charmian!
	Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?
	Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
	O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
	Do bravely, horse, for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
	The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
	And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
	Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
	For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
	With most delicious poison. Think on me,
	That am with Phœbus' amorous pinches black,
	And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Cæsar,
	When thou wast here above the ground I was
	A morsel for a monarch, and great Pompey
	Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
	There would he anchor his aspect and die
	With looking on his life.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 1><SCENE 5><15%>
	How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
	Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath
	With his tinct gilded thee.
	How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
<SPEECH 41><ACT 1><SCENE 5><15%>
	Mine ear must pluck it thence.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 1><SCENE 5><16%>
	What! was he sad or merry?
<SPEECH 43><ACT 1><SCENE 5><16%>
	O well-divided disposition! Note him,
	Note him, good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:
	He was not sad, for he would shire on those
	That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
	Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
	In Egypt with his joy; but between both:
	O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
	The violence of either thee becomes,
	So does it no man else. Mett'st thou my posts?
<SPEECH 44><ACT 1><SCENE 5><16%>
	Who's born that day
	When I forget to send to Antony,
	Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.
	Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,

<SPEECH 45><ACT 1><SCENE 5><16%>
	Be chok'd with such another emphasis!
	Say the brave Antony.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 1><SCENE 5><16%>

	When I was green in judgment, cold in blood,
	To say as I said then! But come, away;

	Or I'll unpeople Egypt.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 2><SCENE 5><28%>
	Give me some music; music, moody food

	Let it alone; let 's to billiards: come, Charmian.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 2><SCENE 5><28%>
	As well a woman with a eunuch play'd

<SPEECH 51><ACT 2><SCENE 5><28%>
	And when good will is show'd, though't come too short,
	The actor may plead pardon. I 'll none now.
	Give me mine angle; we'll to the river: there—
	My music playing far off—I will betray
	Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
	Their slimy jaws; and, as I draw them up,
	I'll think them every one an Antony,
	And say, 'Ah, ha!' you're caught.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 2><SCENE 5><28%>
	That time—O times!—
	I laugh'd him out of patience; and that night
	I laugh'd him into patience: and next morn,

	I wore his sword Philippan.
	O! from Italy;
	Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
	That long time have been barren.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 2><SCENE 5><28%>
	Antony's dead! if thou say so, villain,
	Thou kill'st thy mistress; but well and free,

	My bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kings
	Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 2><SCENE 5><28%>
	Why, there's more gold.
	But, sirrah, mark, we use
	To say the dead are well: bring it to that,
	The gold I give thee will I melt, and pour
	Down thy ill-uttering throat.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 2><SCENE 5><29%>
	Well, go to, I will;
	But there's no goodness in thy face; if Antony
	Be free and healthful, so tart a favour

	Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
	Not like a formal man.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 2><SCENE 5><29%>
	I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:
	Yet, if thou say Antony lives, is well,
	Or friends with Cæsar, or not captive to him,
	I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
	Rich pearls upon thee.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 2><SCENE 5><29%>
	Well said.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 2><SCENE 5><29%>

<SPEECH 60><ACT 2><SCENE 5><29%>
	I do not like 'but yet,' it does allay

	'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
	Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
	Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
	The good and bad together. He's friends with Cæsar;
	In state of health, thou sayst; and thou sayst, free.
<SPEECH 61><ACT 2><SCENE 5><29%>
	For what good turn?
<SPEECH 62><ACT 2><SCENE 5><29%>

	Smarting in lingering pickle.
<SPEECH 65><ACT 2><SCENE 5><30%>
	Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,

	I will not hurt him.
	These hands do lack nobility, that they strike

	Come hither, sir.
	Though it be honest, it is never good

	He is married?
<SPEECH 73><ACT 2><SCENE 5><31%>
	O! that his fault should make a knave of thee,

	Is this certain?

	He goes forth gallantly. That he and Cæsar might

	Then, Antony,—but now.—Well, on.
<SPEECH 139><ACT 4><SCENE 8><73%>
	Lord of lords!
	O infinite virtue! com'st thou smiling from
	The world's great snare uncaught?
<SPEECH 140><ACT 4><SCENE 8><73%>
	I'll give thee, friend,
	An armour all of gold; it was a king's.
<SPEECH 141><ACT 4><SCENE X.— ><77%>
	Why is my lord enrag'd against his love?
<SPEECH 142><ACT 4><SCENE XI.— ><77%>
	Help me, my women! O! he is more mad
	Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly
	Was never so emboss'd.
<SPEECH 143><ACT 4><SCENE XI.— ><77%>
	To the monument!
	Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;
	Say that the last I spoke was 'Antony,'
	And word it, prithee, piteously. Hence,
	Mardian, and bring me how he takes my death.
	To the monument!
<SPEECH 144><ACT 4><SCENE XIII.— ><82%>
	O Charmian! I will never go from hence.
<SPEECH 145><ACT 4><SCENE XIII.— ><82%>
	No, I will not.
	All strange and terrible events are welcome,
	But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,
	Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great
	As that which makes it.
	How now! is he dead?
<SPEECH 146><ACT 4><SCENE XIII.— ><83%>
	O sun!
	Burn the great sphere thou mov'st in; darkling stand
	The varying star o' the world. O Antony,
	Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help;
	Help, friends below! let's draw him hither.
<SPEECH 147><ACT 4><SCENE XIII.— ><83%>
	So it should be, that none but Antony
	Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!
<SPEECH 148><ACT 4><SCENE XIII.— ><83%>
	I dare not, dear,—
	Dear my lord, pardon,—I dare not,
	Lest I be taken: not the imperious show
	Of the full-fortun'd Cæsar ever shall
	Be brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs, serpents, have
	Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:
	Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes
	And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour
	Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,—
	Help me, my women,—we must draw thee up.
	Assist, good friends.
<SPEECH 149><ACT 4><SCENE XIII.— ><83%>
	Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!
	Our strength is all gone into heaviness,
	That makes the weight. Had I great Juno's power,
	The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,
	And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,
	Wishers were ever fools. O! come, come, come;
	And welcome, welcome! die where thou hastliv'd;
	Quicken with kissing; had my lips that power,
	Thus would I wear them out.
<SPEECH 150><ACT 4><SCENE XIII.— ><84%>
	No, let me speak; and let me rail so high,
	That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,
	Provok'd by my offence.
<SPEECH 151><ACT 4><SCENE XIII.— ><84%>
	They do not go together.
<SPEECH 152><ACT 4><SCENE XIII.— ><84%>
	My resolution and my hands I'll trust;
	None about Cæsar.
<SPEECH 153><ACT 4><SCENE XIII.— ><84%>
	Noblest of men, woo 't die?
	Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide
	In this dull world, which in thy absence is
	No better than a sty? O! see my women,
	The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!
	O! wither'd is the garland of the war,
	The soldier's pole is fall'n; young boys and girls
	Are level now with men; the odds is gone,
	And there is nothing left remarkable
	Beneath the visiting moon.
<SPEECH 154><ACT 4><SCENE XIII.— ><85%>
	No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded
	By such poor passion as the maid that milks
	And does the meanest chares. It were for me
	To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
	To tell them that this world did equal theirs
	Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;
	Patience is sottish, and impatience does
	Become a dog that's mad; then is it sin
	To rush into the secret house of death,
	Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
	What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
	My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look!
	Our lamp is spent, it's out. Good sirs, take heart;—
	We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,
	Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
	And make death proud to take us. Come, away;
	This case of that huge spirit now is cold;
	Ah! women, women. Come; we have no friend
	But resolution, and the briefest end.
<SPEECH 155><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
	My desolation does begin to make
	A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Cæsar;
	Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
	A minister of her will; and it is great
	To do that thing that ends all other deeds,
	Which shackles accidents, and bolts up change,
	Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,
	The beggar's nurse and Cæsar's.
<SPEECH 156><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
	What's thy name?
<SPEECH 157><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
	Antony
	Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
	I do not greatly care to be deceiv'd,
	That have no use for trusting. If your master
	Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,
	That majesty, to keep decorum, must
	No less beg than a kingdom; if he please
	To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,
	He gives me so much of mine own as I
	Will kneel to him with thanks.
<SPEECH 158><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	Pray you, tell him
	I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him
	The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
	A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly
	Look him i' the face.
<SPEECH 159><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	Quick, quick, good hands.
<SPEECH 160><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	What, of death too,
	That rids our dogs of languish?
<SPEECH 161><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
	Where art thou, death?
	Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queen
	Worth many babes and beggars!
<SPEECH 162><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;
	If idle talk will once be necessary,
	I'll not sleep neither. This mortal house I'll ruin,
	Do Cæsar what he can. Know, sir, that I
	Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court,
	Nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye
	Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up
	And show me to the shouting varletry
	Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
	Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud
	Lay me stark nak'd, and let the water-flies
	Blow me into abhorring! rather make
	My country's high pyramides my gibbet,
	And hang me up in chains!
<SPEECH 163><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	Say, I would die.
<SPEECH 164><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	I cannot tell.
<SPEECH 165><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
	You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
	Is 't not your trick?
<SPEECH 166><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:
	O! such another sleep, that I might see
	But such another man.
<SPEECH 167><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	His face was as the heavens, and therein stuck
	A sun and moon, which kept their course, and lighted
	The little O, the earth.
<SPEECH 168><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	His legs besfrid the ocean; his rear'd arm
	Crested the world; his voice was propertied
	As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
	But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
	He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
	There was no winter in 't, an autumn 'twas
	That grew the more by reaping; his delights
	Were dolphin-like, they show'd his back above
	The element they liv'd in; in his livery
	Walk'd crowns and crownets, realms and islands were
	As plates dropp'd from his pocket.
<SPEECH 169><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	Think you there was, or might be, such a man
	As this I dream'd of?
<SPEECH 170><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
	But, if there be, or ever were, one such,
	It's past the size of dreaming; nature wants stuff
	To vie strange forms with fancy; yet to imagine
	An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
	Condemning shadows quite.
<SPEECH 171><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	I thank you, sir.
	Know you what Cæsar means to do with me?
<SPEECH 172><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	Nay, pray you, sir,—
<SPEECH 173><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	He'll lead me then in triumph?
<SPEECH 174><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	Sir, the gods
	Will have it thus; my master and my lord
	I must obey.
<SPEECH 175><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	Sole sir o' the world,
	I cannot project mine own cause so well
	To make it clear; but do confess I have
	Been laden with like frailties which before
	Have often sham'd our sex.
<SPEECH 176><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	And may through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,
	Your scutcheons, and your signs of conquest, shall
	Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.
<SPEECH 177><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	</STAGE DIR> This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,
	I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;
	Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?
<SPEECH 178><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	This is my treasurer; let him speak, my lord,
	Upon his peril, that I have reserv'd
	To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.
<SPEECH 179><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	What have I kept back?
<SPEECH 180><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	See! Cæsar! O, behold,
	How pomp is follow'd; mine will now be yours;
	And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
	The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
	Even make me wild. O slave! of no more trust
	Than love that's hir'd. What! goest thou back? thou shalt
	Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,
	Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!
	O rarely base!
<SPEECH 181><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
	O Cæsar! what a wounding shame is this,
	That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,
	Doing the honour of thy lordliness
	To one so meek, that mine own servant should
	Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
	Addition of his envy. Say, good Cæsar,
	That I some lady trifles have reserv'd,
	Immoment toys, things of such dignity
	As we greet modern friends withal; and say,
	Some nobler token I have kept apart
	For Livia and Octavia, to induce
	Their mediation; must I be unfolded
	With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me
	Beneath the fall I have. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Prithee, go hence;
	Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
	Through the ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man,
	Thou wouldst have mercy on me.
<SPEECH 182><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought
	For things that others do; and, when we fall,
	We answer others' merits in our name,
	Are therefore to be pitied.
<SPEECH 183><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	My master, and my lord!
<SPEECH 184><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not

<SPEECH 185><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	Hie thee again:
	I have spoke already, and it is provided;
	Go, put it to the haste.
<SPEECH 186><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	Dolabella!
<SPEECH 187><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	Dolabella,

<SPEECH 188><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	Farewell, and thanks.
	Now, Iras, what think'st thou?
	Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shall be shown
	In Rome, as well as I; mechanic slaves
	With greasy aprons, rules and hammers, shall
	Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,
	Rank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded,
	And forc'd to drink their vapour.
<SPEECH 189><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras. Saucy lictors
	Will catch at us, like strumpets, and scald rimers
	Ballad us out o' tune; the quick comedians
	Extemporally will stage us, and present
	Our Alexandrian revels. Antony
	Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
	Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
	I' the posture of a whore.
<SPEECH 190><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	Nay, that's certain.
<SPEECH 191><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	Why, that's the way
	To fool their preparation, and to conquer
	Their most absurd intents.
	Now, Charmian,
	Show me, my women, like a queen; go fetch
	My best attires; I am again for Cydnus,
	To meet Mark Antony. Sirrah Iras, go.
	Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;
	And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave
	To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.
	Wherefore's this noise?
<SPEECH 192><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
	Let him come in. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> What poor an instrument
	May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.
	My resolution's plac'd, and I have nothing

	No planet is of mine.
<SPEECH 193><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
	Avoid, and leave him.

	Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have

	The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip.
	Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
	Antony call; I see him rouse himself
	To praise my noble act; I hear him mock
	The luck of Cæsar, which the gods give men
	To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:
	Now to that name my courage prove my title!
	I am fire, and air; my other elements
	I give to baser life. So; have you done?
	Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
	Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.
	Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
	If thou and nature can so gently part,
	The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
	Which hurts, and is desir'd. Dost thou lie still?
	If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world
	It is not worth leave-taking.
<SPEECH 202><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
	This proves me base:
	If she first meet the curled Antony,
	He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
	Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou mortal wretch,
	With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
	Of life at once untie; poor venomous fool,
	Be angry, and dispatch. O! couldst thou speak,
	That I might hear thee call great Cæsar ass
	Unpolicied.
<SPEECH 203><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
	Peace, peace!
	Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,
