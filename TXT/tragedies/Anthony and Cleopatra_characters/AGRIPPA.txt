	Give me leave, Cæsar.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 2><22%>
	Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
	Admir'd Octavia; great Mark Antony
	Is now a widower.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 2><22%>
	To hold you in perpetual amity,
	To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
	With an unslipping knot, take Antony
	Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
	No worse a husband than the best of men,
	Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
	That which none else can utter. By this marriage,
	All little jealousies which now seem great,
	And all great fears which now import their dangers,
	Would then be nothing; truths would be but tales
	Where now half tales be truths; her love to both
	Would each to other and all loves to both
	Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke,
	For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
	By duty ruminated.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
	Good Enobarbus!
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
	There she appeared indeed, or my reporter devised well for her.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
	O! rare for Antony.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
	Rare Egyptian!
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
	Royal wench!
	She made great Cæsar lay his sword to bed;
	He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
	Let us go.
	Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
	Whilst you abide here.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 4><27%>
	Sir, Mark Antony
	Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 4><27%>
	Sir, good success!
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 2><42%>
	What! are the brothers parted?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 2><42%>
	'Tis a noble Lepidus.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 2><42%>
	Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 2><42%>
	What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 2><42%>
	O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 2><42%>
	Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 2><42%>
	Both he loves.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 2><42%>
	Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 2><43%>
	He has a cloud in's face.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 2><43%>
	Why, Enobarbus,
	When Antony found Julius Cæsar dead
	He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
	When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 6><48%>
	Who, queasy with his insolence
	Already, will their good thoughts call from him.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 6><48%>
	Whom does he accuse?
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 6><48%>
	Sir, this should be answer'd.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 6><50%>
	Welcome, lady.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 6><71%>
	Cæsar, I shall.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 7><72%>
	Retire, we have engag'd ourselves too far.
	Cæsar himself has work, and our oppression
	Exceeds what we expected.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	And strange it is,
	That nature must compel us to lament
	Our most persisted deeds.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
	A rarer spirit never
	Did steer humanity; but you, gods, will give us
	Some faults to make us men. Cæsar is touch'd.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
	Dolabella!
