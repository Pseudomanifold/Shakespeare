	There's strange news come, sir.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 5><47%>
	Cæsar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 5><47%>
	Cæsar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey, presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the glory of the action; and not resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: so the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 5><47%>
	He's walking in the garden—thus: and spurns
	The rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool, Lepidus!'
	And threats the throat of that his officer
	That murder'd Pompey.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 5><47%>
	For Italy and Cæsar. More, Domitius;
	My lord desires you presently: my news
	I might have told hereafter.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 5><47%>
	Come, sir.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
	Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
	See you here, sir?
<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
	Sir, sir!
<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
	The queen, my lord, the queen.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
	Most noble sir, arise; the queen approaches:
	Her head's declin'd, and death will seize her, but
	Your comfort makes the rescue.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
	Sir, the queen.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 4><69%>
	Briefly, sir.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 5><70%>
	Sir, his chests and treasure
	He has not with him.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 7><72%>
	They are beaten, sir; and our advantage serves
	For a fair victory.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE XII.— ><78%>
	Ay, noble lord.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE XII.— ><78%>
	Ay, my lord.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE XII.— ><78%>
	It does, my lord.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE XII.— ><79%>
	What would my lord?
<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE XII.— ><80%>
	The gods withhold me!
	Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
	Though enemy, lost aim and could not?
<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE XII.— ><80%>
	I would not see't.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE XII.— ><80%>
	O, sir! pardon me.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE XII.— ><80%>
	Turn from me then that noble countenance,
	Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE XII.— ><80%>
	My sword is drawn.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE XII.— ><80%>
	My dear master,
	My captain, and my emperor, let me say,
	Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE XII.— ><81%>
	Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE XII.— ><81%>
	Why, there then; thus do I escape the sorrow
	Of Antony's death.
