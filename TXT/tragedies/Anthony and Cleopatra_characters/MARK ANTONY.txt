<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
	Fie, wrangling queen!

	Of many our contriving friends in Rome
	Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius

	The empire of the sea; our slippery people—
	Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
	Till his deserts are past—begin to throw
	Pompey the Great and all his dignities
	Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
	Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
	For the main soldier, whose quality, going on,
	The sides o' the world may danger. Much is breeding,
	Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,
	And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,
	To such whose place is under us, requires
	Our quick remove from hence.

<SPEECH 32><ACT 1><SCENE 3><10%>
	How now, lady!
<SPEECH 33><ACT 1><SCENE 3><10%>
	Hear me, queen:
	The strong necessity of time commands
	Our services awhile, but my full heart
	Remains in use with you. Our Italy
	Shines o'er with civil swords; Sextus Pompeius
	Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;
	Equality of two domestic powers
	Breeds scrupulous faction. The hated, grown to strength,
	Are newly grown to love; the condemn'd Pompey,
	Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace
	Into the hearts of such as have not thriv'd
	Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
	And quietness, grown aick of rest, would purge
	By any desperate change. My more particular,
	And that which most with you should safe my going,
	Is Fulvia's death.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 1><SCENE 3><10%>
	She's dead, my queen:
	Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
	The garboils she awak'd; at the last, best,
	See when and where she died.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 1><SCENE 3><10%>
	Quarrel no more, but be prepar'd to know
	The purposes I bear, which are or cease
	As you shall give the advice. By the fire
	That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
	Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war
	As thou affect'st.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 1><SCENE 3><11%>
	My precious queen, forbear,
	And give true evidence to his love which stands

<SPEECH 38><ACT 1><SCENE 3><11%>

	But that your royalty

	Our separation so abides and flies,

	If we compose well here, to Parthia:

<SPEECH 43><ACT 2><SCENE 2><19%>
	'Tis spoken well.

<SPEECH 44><ACT 2><SCENE 2><19%>

	Sit, sir.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 2><SCENE 2><19%>

	My being in Egypt, Cæsar,

<SPEECH 48><ACT 2><SCENE 2><20%>
	How intend you, practis'd?
<SPEECH 49><ACT 2><SCENE 2><20%>
	You do mistake your business; my brother never
	Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;
	And have my learning from some true reports,
	That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
	Discredit my authority with yours,
	And make the wars alike against my stomach,
	Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
	Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,
	As matter whole you n' have to make it with,
	It must not be with this.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 2><SCENE 2><20%>
	Not so, not so;
	I know you could not lack, I am certain on 't,
	Very necessity of this thought, that I,
	Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
	Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
	Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,
	I would you had her spirit in such another:
	The third o' the world is yours, which with a snaffle
	You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 2><SCENE 2><20%>
	So much uncurbable, her garboils, Cæsar,
	Made out of her impatience,—which not wanted
	Shrewdness of policy too,—I grieving grant
	Did you too much disquiet; for that you must
	But say I could not help it.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 2><SCENE 2><21%>
	Sir,
	He fell upon me, ere admitted: then
	Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want
	Of what I was i' the morning; but next day
	I told him of myself, which was as much
	As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
	Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,
	Out of our question wipe him.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 2><SCENE 2><21%>
	No,
	Lepidus, let him speak:
	The honour's sacred which he talks on now,
	Supposing that I lack'd it. But on, Cæsar;
	The article of my oath.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 2><SCENE 2><21%>
	Neglected, rather;
	And then, when poison'd hours had bound me up
	From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,
	I'll play the penitent to you; but mine honesty
	Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
	Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,
	To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;
	For which myself, the ignorant motive, do
	So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
	To stoop in such a case.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 2><SCENE 2><22%>
	Thou art a soldier only; speak no more.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 2><SCENE 2><22%>

	To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,

	And sway our great designs!
<SPEECH 61><ACT 2><SCENE 2><23%>
	I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey,

	Get thee gone:

	He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap
	He hath spoken true; the very dice obey him.
	And in our sports my better cunning faints
	Under his chance; if we draw lots he speeds,
	His cocks do win the battle still of mine
	When it is all to nought, and his quails ever
	Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt;
	And though I make this marriage for my peace,
	I' the east my pleasure lies.
	O! come, Ventidius,
	You must to Parthia; your commission's ready;
	Follow me, and receive 't.
<SPEECH 73><ACT 2><SCENE 6><32%>
	Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;

	Which do not be entreated to, but weigh

	The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,

	That will I, Pompey.
<SPEECH 79><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>

	Show us the way, sir.
<SPEECH 82><ACT 2><SCENE 7><36%>
	Thus do they, sir. They take the flow o' the Nile

	And shortly comes to harvest.

	They are so.

	Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,

	To public ear:
	Spoke scantly of me; when perforce he could not

	When the best hint was given him, he not took 't,
	Or did it from his teeth.
<SPEECH 103><ACT 3><SCENE 4><46%>
	Gentle Octavia,
	Let your best love draw to that point which seeks

	When it appears to you where this begins,

	Is it not strange, Canidius,

	I follow'd that I blush to look upon:

	Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
	All that is won and lost. Give me a kiss;

	Some wine, within there, and our viands! Fortune knows,

	To him again. Tell him he wears the rose

	As i' the command of Cæsar: I dare him therefore

	And answer me declin'd, sword against sword,
	Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.

<SPEECH 129><ACT 3><SCENE XI.— ><61%>
	Approach there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods and devils!
	Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'

	Antony yet.
	Take hence this Jack and whip him.
<SPEECH 130><ACT 3><SCENE XI.— ><62%>
	Moon and stars!
	Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries

<SPEECH 131><ACT 3><SCENE XI.— ><62%>
	Tug him away; being whipp'd,

	You have been a boggler ever:
	But when we in our viciousness grow hard,—

	To our confusion.
<SPEECH 133><ACT 3><SCENE XI.— ><62%>
	I found you as a morsel, cold upon
	Dead Cæsar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment

	Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have
	Luxuriously pick'd out; for, I am sure,

	The horned herd; for I have savage cause;
	And to proclaim it civilly were like

	If that thy father live, let him repent

	Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth,
	The white hand of a lady fever thee,
	Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Cæsar,
	Tell him thy entertainment; look, thou say
	He makes me angry with him; for he seems
	Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
	Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;
	And at this time most easy 'tis to do 't,
	When my good stars, that were my former guides,
	Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires
	Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike
	My speech and what is done, tell him he has
	Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
	He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,
	As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:

	Cæsar sits down in Alexandria, where

	Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy too
	Have knit again, and fleet, threat'ning most sea-like.
	Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?
	If from the field I shall return once more
	To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;
	I and my sword will earn our chronicle:
	There's hope in 't yet.
<SPEECH 141><ACT 3><SCENE XI.— ><64%>
	I will betreble-sinew'd, hearted, breath'd,
	And fight maliciously; for when mine hours
	Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
	Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,
	And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
	Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me
	All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;
	Let's mock the midnight bell.
<SPEECH 142><ACT 3><SCENE XI.— ><65%>
	We will yet do well.
<SPEECH 143><ACT 3><SCENE XI.— ><65%>
	Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force

	Even with his pestilent scythe.

<SPEECH 147><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Well said; come on.
	Call forth my household servants; let's to-night
	Be bounteous at our meal.
	Give me thy hand,
	Thou hast been rightly honest; so hast thou;
	Thou; and thou, and thou: you have serv'd me well,
	And kings have been your fellows.
<SPEECH 148><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	And thou art honest too.
	I wish I could be made so many men,

<SPEECH 149><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night,

<SPEECH 150><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	Tend me to-night;
	May be it is the period of your duty:
	Haply, you shall not see me more; or if,
	A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow
	You'll serve another master. I look on you
	As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,
	I turn you not away; but, like a master
	Married to your good service, stay till death.
	Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,
	And the gods yield you for 't!
<SPEECH 151><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
	Ho, ho, ho!
	Now, the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
	Grace grow where those drops fall! My hearty friends,
	You take me in too dolorous a sense,

	To burn this night with torches. Know, my hearts,
	I hope well of to-morrow; and will lead you
	Where rather I'll expect victorious life
	Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,

	A workman in 't.
	Good morrow to thee; welcome;

	We have beat him to his camp; run one before
	And let the queen know of our gests. To-morrow,
	Before the sun shall see 's, we'll spill the blood
	That has to-day escap'd. I thank you all;
	For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
	Not as you serv'd the cause, but as 't had been
	Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.
	Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
	Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears
	Wash the congealment from your wounds, and kiss

	Ride on the pants triumphing.

	Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand:
	Kiss it, my warrior: he hath fought to-day
	As if a god, in hate of mankind, had
	Destroy'd in such a shape.
<SPEECH 168><ACT 4><SCENE 8><74%>
	He has deserv'd it, were it carbuncled

	Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:
	Had our great palace the capacity
	To camp this host, we all would sup together
	And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
	Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
	With brazen din blast you the city's ear,
	Make mingle with our rattling tabourines,

	They have put forth the haven,
	Where their appointment we may best discover
	And look on their endeavour.
<SPEECH 171><ACT 4><SCENE X.— ><76%>
	Yet they are not join'd. Where yond pine does stand

<SPEECH 172><ACT 4><SCENE X.— ><76%>
	All is lost!
	This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me;
	My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder
	They cast their caps up and carouse together
	Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore! 'tis thou
	Hast sold me to this novice, and my heart
	Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
	For when I am reveng'd upon my charm,
	I have done all. Bid them all fly; be gone.
	O sun! thy uprise shall I see no more;
	Fortune and Antony part here; even here
	Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
	That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave
	Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
	On blossoming Cæsar; and this pine is bark'd,
	That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am.
	O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,
	Whose eyes beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home,
	Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,
	Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
	Beguil'd me to the very heart of loss.
	What, Eros! Eros!
	Ah! thou spell. Avaunt!
<SPEECH 173><ACT 4><SCENE X.— ><77%>
	Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving,
	And blemish Cæsar's triumph. Let him take thee,

	Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
	For poor'st diminutives, for doits; and let
	Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
	With her prepared nails.
	'Tis well thou'rt gone,
	If it be well to live; but better 'twere
	Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death
	Might have prevented many. Eros, ho!
	The shirt of Nessus is upon me; teach me,
	Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage;
	Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon;
	And with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club,
	Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die:
	To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall
	Under this plot; she dies for 't. Eros, ho!

	Eros, thou yet behold'st me?
<SPEECH 175><ACT 4><SCENE XII.— ><78%>

	My good knave, Eros, now thy captain is

	I made these wars for Egypt; and the queen,

	Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto 't
	A million more, now lost; she, Eros, has
	Pack'd cards with Cæsar, and false-play'd my glory
	Unto an enemy's triumph.
	Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us
	Ourselves to end ourselves.
	O! thy vile lady;
	She has robb'd me of my sword.
<SPEECH 178><ACT 4><SCENE XII.— ><78%>

	</STAGE DIR> That thou depart'st hence safe,

	Off, pluck off:
	The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep

	Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.
	No more a soldier; bruised pieces, go;
	You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.
	I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
	Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
	All length is torture; since the torch is out,
	Lie down, and stray no further. Now all labour
	Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
	Itself with strength; seal then, and all is done.
	Eros!—I come, my queen.—Eros!—Stay for me:
	Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
	And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze;
	Dido and her Æneas shall want troops,
	And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros! Eros!
<SPEECH 181><ACT 4><SCENE XII.— ><79%>
	Since Cleopatra died,
	I have liv'd in such dishonour, that the gods

	With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
	The courage of a woman; less noble mind
	Than she, which by her death our Cæsar tells
	'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,
	That, when the exigent should come,—which now
	Is come indeed,—when I should see behind me
	The inevitable prosecution of
	Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
	Thou then wouldst kill me: do 't; the time is come.

	Of fortunate Cæsar, drawn before him, branded

	A bridegroom in my death, and run into 't
	As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,
	Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus

	The noblest; and do now not basely die,
	Not cowardly put off my helmet to
	My countryman; a Roman by a Roman
	Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going;
	I can no more.
