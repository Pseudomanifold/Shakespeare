	Cæsar, 'tis his schoolmaster:
	An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
	He sends so poor a pinion of his wing,
	Which had superfluous kings for messengers
	Not many moons gone by.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
	Cæsar, I shall.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	Proculeius,
	What thou hast done thy master Cæsar knows,
	And he hath sent for thee; as for the queen,
	I'll take her to my guard.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	Most noble empress, you have heard of me?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	Assuredly you know me.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
	I understand not, madam.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	If it might please ye,—
<SPEECH 8><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	Most sovereign creature,—
<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	Cleopatra,—
<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	Gentle madam, no.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	Hear me, good madam.
	Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it
	As answering to the weight: would I might never
	O'ertake pursu'd success, but I do feel,
	By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
	My very heart at root.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
	Though he be honourable,—
<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	Madam, he will; I know 't.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
	It is the emperor, madam.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	Where is the queen?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
	Which my love makes religion to obey,
	I tell you this: Cæsar through Syria
	Intends his journey; and within three days
	You with your children will be send before.
	Make your best use of this; I have perform'd
	Your pleasure and my promise.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
	I your servant.
	Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Cæsar.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 2><99%>
	How goes it here?
<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 2><99%>
	Cæsar, thy thoughts
	Touch their effects in this; thyself art coming
	To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
	So sought'st to hinder.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 2><99%>
	O! sir, you are too sure an augurer;
	That you did fear is done.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 2><99%>
	Who was last with them?
<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 2><99%>
	Here, on her breast,
	There is a vent of blood, and something blown;
	The like is on her arm.
