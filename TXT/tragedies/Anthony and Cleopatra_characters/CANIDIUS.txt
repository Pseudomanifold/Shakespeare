	Why will my lord do so?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 7><52%>
	Ay, and to wage his battle at Pharsalia,
	Where Cæsar fought with Pompey; but these offers,
	Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off;
	And so should you.

	Soldier, thou art; but his whole action grows
	Not in the power on 't: so our leader's led,
	And we are women's men.

	Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
	Publicola, and Cælius, are for sea;
	But we keep whole by land. This speed of Cæsar's
	Carries beyond belief.

	Who's his lieutenant, hear you?
<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 7><53%>
	Well I know the man.

	Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
	And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
	Been what he knew himself, it had gone well:
	O! he has given example for our flight
	Most grossly by his own.

	Towards Peloponnesus are they fled.

	To Cæsar will I render
	My legions and my horse; six kings already
	Show me the way of yielding.
