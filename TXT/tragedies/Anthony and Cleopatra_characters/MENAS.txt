	Cæsar and Lepidus
	Are in the field; a mighty strength they carry.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><17%>
	From Silvius, sir.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><18%>
	I cannot hope
	Cæsar and Antony shall well greet together;
	His wife that's dead did trespasses to Cæsar,
	His brother warr'd upon him, although I think
	Not mov'd by Antony.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
	Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have made this treaty. You and I have known, sir.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
	We have, sir.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
	And you by land.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	Nor what I have done by water.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	And you by land.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	All men's faces are true, whatsoe'er their hands are.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	No slander; they steal hearts.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking. Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	You have said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	Pray ye, sir?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	Then is Cæsar and he for ever knit together.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
	Who would not have his wife so?
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 6><36%>
	And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a health for you.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 6><36%>
	Come; let 's away.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 7><37%>
	Pompey, a word.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 7><37%>
	Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee, captain,
	And bear me speak a word.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 7><38%>
	If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me,
	Rise from thy stool.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 7><38%>
	I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 7><38%>
	Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 7><38%>
	Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That 's twice.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 7><38%>
	But entertain it,
	And though thou think me poor, I am the man
	Will give thee all the world.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 7><38%>
	No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
	Thou art, if thou dar'st be, the earthly Jove:
	Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,
	Is thine, if thou wilt ha 't.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 7><38%>
	These three world-sharers, these competitors,
	Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;
	And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:
	All there is thine.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 7><38%>
	</STAGE DIR> For this,
	I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
	Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,
	Shall never find it more.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 7><39%>
	Enobarbus, welcome!
<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 7><39%>
	Why?
<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 7><39%>
	The third part then is drunk; would it were all,
	That it might go on wheels!
<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 7><39%>
	Come.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 7><40%>
	No, to my cabin.
	These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!
	Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
	To these great fellows: sound and be hang'd! sound out!
<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 7><40%>
	Hoo! noble captain! come.
