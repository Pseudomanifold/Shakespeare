	Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas, almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer that you praised so to the queen? O! that I knew this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns with garlands.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
	Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
	Good sir, give me good fortune.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
	Pray then, foresee me one.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
	He means in flesh.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
	Wrinkles forbid!
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
	Hush!
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
	I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
	Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all; let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage; find me to marry me with Octavius Cæsar, and companion me with my mistress.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
	O excellent! I love long life better than figs.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
	Then, belike, my children shall have no names; prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 2><4%>
	Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 2><4%>
	Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 2><4%>
	E'en as the overflowing Nilus presageth famine.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 2><4%>
	Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear.
	Prithee, tell her but a worky-day fortune.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 2><4%>
	Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I, where would you choose it?
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 2><4%>
	Our worser thoughts heaven mend! Alexas,—come, his fortune, his fortune. O! let him marry a woman that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee; and let her die too, and give him a worse; and let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow him laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 2><4%>
	Amen.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 2><5%>
	Not he; the queen.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 2><5%>
	No, madam.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 3><8%>
	I did not see him since.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 3><9%>
	Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
	You do not hold the method to enforce
	The like from him.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 3><9%>
	In each thing give him way, cross him in nothing.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 3><9%>
	Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear:
	In time we hate that which we often fear.
	But here comes Antony.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
	Madam!
<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
	Why, madam?
<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
	You think of him too much.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
	Madam, I trust, not so.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 1><SCENE 5><16%>
	O! that brave Cæsar.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 1><SCENE 5><16%>
	The valiant Cæsar!
<SPEECH 31><ACT 1><SCENE 5><16%>
	By your most gracious pardon,
	I sing but after you.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 5><28%>
	My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 5><28%>
	'Twas merry when
	You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
	Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he
	With fervency drew up.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 5><30%>
	Good madam, keep yourself within yourself;
	The man is innocent.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 5><30%>
	He is afeard to come.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 5><31%>
	Good your highness, patience.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 5><31%>
	Many times, madam.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 3><44%>
	Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 3><45%>
	Three in Egypt
	Cannot make better note.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 3><45%>
	Excellent.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 3><45%>
	A proper man.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 3><SCENE 3><45%>
	Nothing, madam.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 3><45%>
	Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
	And serving you so long!
<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 3><46%>
	I warrant you, madam.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
	Do! Why, what else?
<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
	Madam!
<SPEECH 47><ACT 4><SCENE 4><70%>
	Please you, retire to your chamber.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 4><SCENE XI.— ><77%>
	To the monument!
	There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.
	The soul and body rive not more in parting
	Than greatness going off.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 4><SCENE XIII.— ><82%>
	Be comforted, dear madam.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 4><SCENE XIII.— ><85%>
	O, quietness, lady!
<SPEECH 51><ACT 4><SCENE XIII.— ><85%>
	Lady!

	O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	Madam, I will.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
	Behold, sir.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
	Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,
	The gods themselves do weep.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
	O eastern star!
<SPEECH 59><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
	O, break! O, break!
<SPEECH 60><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
	In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
	Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
	A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
	And golden Phœbus never be beheld
	Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;
	I'll mend it, and then play.
<SPEECH 61><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
	Speak softly, wake her not.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
	Too slow a messenger.
	O! come apace, dispatch; I partly feel thee.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 5><SCENE 2><99%>
	It is well done, and fitting for a princess
	Descended of so many royal kings.
	Ah! soldier.
