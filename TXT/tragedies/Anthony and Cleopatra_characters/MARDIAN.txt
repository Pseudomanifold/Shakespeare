	What 's your highness' pleasure?
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 5><15%>
	Yes, gracious madam.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 5><15%>
	Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
	But what in deed is honest to be done;
	Yet have I fierce affections, and think
	What Venus did with Mars.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 5><28%>
	As well as I can, madam.

	No, Antony;
	My mistress lov'd thee, and her fortunes mingled
	With thine entirely.

	Death of one person can be paid but once,
	And that she has discharg'd. What thou wouldst do
	Is done unto thy hand; the last she spake
	Was, 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
	Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
	The name of Antony; it was divided
	Between her heart and lips. She render'd life,
	Thy name so buried in her.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE XII.— ><79%>
	Dead.
