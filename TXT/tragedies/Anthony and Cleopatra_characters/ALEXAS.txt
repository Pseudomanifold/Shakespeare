	Show him your hand.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
	Vex not his prescience; be attentive.

	Nay, hear him.

	Lo, now! if it lay in their hands to make me acuckold, they would make themselves whores, but they'd do't!

	Here, at your service. My lord approaches.

	Sovereign of Egypt, hail!

	Last thing he did, dear queen,
	He kiss'd, the last of many doubled kisses,
	This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 5><15%>
	'Good friend,' quoth he,
	'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
	This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
	To mend the petty present, I will piece
	Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,
	Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,
	And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
	Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke
	Was beastly dumb'd by him.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 5><16%>
	Like to the time o' the year between the extremes
	Of hot and cold; he was nor sad nor merry.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 5><16%>
	Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
	Why do you send so thick?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 3><44%>
	Half afeard to come.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 3><44%>
	Good majesty,
	Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
	But when you are well pleas'd.
