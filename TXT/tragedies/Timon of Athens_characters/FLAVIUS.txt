	My lord!
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><19%>
	Yes, my lord. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> More jewels yet!
	There is no crossing him in 's humour;
	Else I should tell him well, i' faith, I should,
	When all's spent, he'd be cross'd then, an he could.
	'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,
	That man might ne'er be wretched for his mind.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><20%>
	I beseech your honour,
	Vouchsafe me a word; it does concern you near.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><20%>
	</STAGE DIR> I scarce know how.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><21%>
	</STAGE DIR> What will this come to?
	He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,
	And all out of an empty coffer:
	Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,
	To show him what a beggar his heart is,
	Being of no power to make his wishes good.
	His promises fly so beyond his state
	That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes
	For every word: he is so kind that he now
	Pays interest for't; his land's put to their books.
	Well, would I were gently put out of office
	Before I were forc'd out!
	Happier he that has no friend to feed
	Than such as do e'en enemies exceed.
	I bleed inwardly for my lord.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
	No care, no stop! so senseless of expense,
	That he will neither know how to maintain it,
	Nor cease his flow of riot: takes no account
	How things go from him, nor resumes no care
	Of what is to continue: never mind
	Was to be so unwise, to be so kind.
	What shall be done? He will not hear, till feel:
	I must be round with him, now he comes from hunting.
	Fie, fie, fie, fie!
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 2><27%>
	Please you, gentlemen,
	The time is unagreeable to this business:
	Your importunacy cease till after dinner,
	That I may make his lordship understand
	Wherefore you are not paid.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><27%>
	Pray, draw near.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	Pray you, walk near: I'll speak with you anon.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	You would not hear me,
	At many leisures I propos'd.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	O my good lord!
	At many times I brought in my accounts,
	Laid them before you; you would throw them off,
	And say you found them in mine honesty.
	When for some trifling present you have bid me
	Return so much, I have shook my head, and wept;
	Yea, 'gainst the authority of manners, pray'd you
	To hold your hand more close: I did endure
	Not seldom, nor no slight checks, when I have
	Prompted you in the ebb of your estate
	And your great flow of debts. My loved lord,
	Though you hear now, too late, yet now's a time,
	The greatest of your having lacks a half
	To pay your present debts.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	'Tis all engag'd, some forfeited and gone;
	And what remains will hardly stop the mouth
	Of present dues; the future comes apace:
	What shall defend the interim? and at length
	How goes our reckoning?
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
	O my good lord! the world is but a word;
	Were it all yours to give it in a breath,
	How quickly were it gone!
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
	If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,
	Call me before the exactest auditors,
	And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,
	When all our offices have been oppress'd
	With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept
	With drunken spilth of wine, when every room
	Hath blaz'd with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy,
	I have retir'd me to a wasteful cock,
	And set mine eyes at flow.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
	Heavens! have I said, the bounty of this lord!
	How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
	This night englutted! Who is not Timon's?
	What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is Lord Timon's?
	Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!
	Ah! when the means are gone that buy this praise,
	The breath is gone whereof this praise is made:
	Feast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter showers,
	These flies are couch'd.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
	I have been bold,—
	For that I knew it the most general way,—
	To them to use your signet and your name;
	But they do shake their heads, and I am here
	No richer in return.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
	They answer, in a joint and corporate voice,
	That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot
	Do what they would; are sorry; you are honourable;
	But yet they could have wish'd; they know not;
	Something hath been amiss; a noble nature
	May catch a wrench; would all were well; 'tis pity;
	And so, intending other serious matters,
	After distasteful looks and these hard fractions,
	With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods
	They froze me into silence.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
	I would I could not think it: that thought is bounty's foe;
	Being free itself, it thinks all others so.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 4><46%>
	What do you ask of me, my friend?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 4><46%>
	Ay,
	If money were as certain as your waiting,
	'Twere sure enough.
	Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,
	When your false masters eat of my lord's meat?
	Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts,
	And take down the interest into their gluttonous maws.
	You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up;
	Let me pass quietly:
	Believe't, my lord and I have made an end;
	I have no more to reckon, he to spend.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 4><46%>
	If 'twill not serve, 'tis not so base as you;

	Here, my lord.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 4><49%>
	O my lord!
	You only speak from your distracted soul;
	There is not so much left to furnish out
	A moderate table.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 2><61%>
	Alack! my fellows, what should I say to you?
	Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,
	I am as poor as you.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 2><61%>
	All broken implements of a ruin'd house.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 2><61%>
	Good fellows all,
	The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.
	Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake
	Let's yet be fellows; let's shake our heads, and say,
	As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes,
	'We have seen better days.' Let each take some;
	Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more:
	Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.
	O! the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us.
	Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
	Since riches point to misery and contempt?
	Who would be so mock'd with glory? or so live,
	But in a dream of friendship?
	To have his pomp and all what state compounds
	But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?
	Poor honest lord! brought low by his own heart,
	Undone by goodness. Strange, unusual blood,
	When man's worst sin is he does too much good!
	Who then dares to be half so kind agen?
	For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.
	My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accurs'd,
	Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes
	Are made thy chief affictions. Alas! kind lord,
	He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
	Of monstrous friends;
	Nor has he with him to supply his life,
	Or that which can command it.
	I'll follow and inquire him out:
	I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;
	Whilst I have gold I'll be his steward still.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 3><82%>
	O you gods!
	Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?
	Full of decay and failing? O monument
	And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd!
	What an alteration of honour
	Has desperate want made!
	What viler thing upon the earth than friends
	Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!
	How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,
	When man was wish'd to love his enemies!
	Grant I may ever love, and rather woo
	Those that would mischief me than those that do!
	He hath caught me in his eye: I will present
	My honest grief unto him; and, as my lord,
	Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
	Have you forgot me, sir?
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
	An honest poor servant of yours.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
	The gods are witness,
	Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief
	For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
	I beg of you to know me, good my lord,
	To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts
	To entertain me as your steward still.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 3><84%>
	No, my most worthy master; in whose breast
	Doubt and suspect, alas! are plac'd too late.
	You should have fear'd false times when you did feast;
	Suspect still comes when an estate is least.
	That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,
	Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,
	Care of your food and living; and, believe it,
	My most honour'd lord,
	For any benefit that points to me,
	Either in hope, or present, I'd exchange
	For this one wish, that you had power and wealth
	To requite me by making rich yourself.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 3><85%>
	O! let me stay
	And comfort you, my master.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	It is in vain that you would speak with Timon;
	For he is set so only to himself
	That nothing but himself, which looks like man,
	Is friendly with him.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
	Here is his cave.
	Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon!
	Look out, and speak to friends. The Athenians,
	By two of their most reverend senate, greet thee:
	Speak to them, noble Timon.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
	Stay not; all's in vain.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
	Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.
