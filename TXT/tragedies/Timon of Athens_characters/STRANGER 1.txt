	We know him for no less, though we are but strangers to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's happy hours are done and past, and his estate shrinks from him.

	Do you observe this, Hostilius?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 2><41%>
	Why this is the world's soul; and just of the same piece
	Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him
	His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in
	My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,
	And kept his credit with his purse,
	Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money
	Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks
	But Timon's silver treads upon his lip;
	And yet, O! see the monstrousness of man,
	When he looks out in an ungrateful shape,
	He does deny him, in respect of his,
	What charitable men afford to beggars.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 2><41%>
	For mine own part,
	I never tasted Timon in my life,
	Nor came any of his bounties over me,
	To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,
	For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue,
	And honourable carriage,
	Had his necessity made use of me,
	I would have put my wealth into donation,
	And the best half should have return'd to him,
	So much I love his heart. But, I perceive,
	Men must learn now with pity to dispense;
	For policy sits above conscience.
