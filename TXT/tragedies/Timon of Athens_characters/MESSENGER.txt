	Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt,
	His means most short, his creditors most strait:
	Your honourable letter he desires
	To those have shut him up; which, failing,
	Periods his comfort.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	Your lordship ever binds him.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	All happiness to your honour.

	I have spoke the least;
	Besides, his expedition promises
	Present approach.

	I met a courier, one mine ancient friend,
	Whom, though in general part we were oppos'd,
	Yet our old love made a particular force,
	And made us speak like friends: this man was riding
	From Alcibiades to Timon's cave,
	With letters of entreaty, which imported
	His fellowship i' the cause against your city,
	In part for his sake mov'd.
