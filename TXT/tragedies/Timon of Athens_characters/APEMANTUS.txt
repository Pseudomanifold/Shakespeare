	Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;
	When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
	Are they not Athenians?
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	Then I repent not.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	Thou know'st I do; I call'd thee by thy name.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	Right, if doing nothing be death by the law.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	The best, for the innocence.

	He wrought better that made the painter; and yet he's but a filthy piece of work.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	Thy mother's of my generation: what's she, if I be a dog?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	No; I eat not lords.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	O! they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	So thou apprehendest it, take it for thy labour.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
	Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost a man a doit.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!
<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	Thou liest.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	Yes.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	Art not a poet?
<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thou hast feigned him a worthy fellow.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o' the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!
<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	Even as Apemantus does now; hate a lord with my heart.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	Ay.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	That I had no angry wit to be a lord.
	Art not thou a merchant?
<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
	Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!

	So, so, there!

	That there should be small love 'mongst these sweet knaves,
	And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out
	Into baboon and monkey.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 1><11%>
	Time to be honest.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 1><SCENE 1><11%>
	The more accursed thou, that still omitt'st it.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 1><SCENE 1><11%>
	Ay; to see meat fill khaves and wine heat fools.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 1><SCENE 1><12%>
	Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 1><SCENE 1><12%>
	Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to give thee none.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 1><SCENE 1><12%>
	No, I will do nothing at thy bidding: make thy requests to thy friend.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 1><SCENE 1><12%>
	I will fly, like a dog, the heels of an ass.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 1><SCENE 2><14%>
	Ho, ho! confess'd it; hang'd it, have you not?
<SPEECH 35><ACT 1><SCENE 2><14%>
	No,
	You shall not make me welcome:
	I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 1><SCENE 2><14%>
	Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon:
	I come to observe; I give thee warning on't.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 1><SCENE 2><14%>
	I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me, for I should
	Ne'er flatter thee. O you gods! what a number
	Of men eat Timon, and he sees them not.
	It grieves me to see so many dip their meat
	In one man's blood; and all the madness is,
	He cheers them up too.
	I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:
	Methinks they should invite them without knives;
	Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.
	There's much example for't; the fellow that
	Sits next him now, parts bread with him, and pledges
	The breath of him in a divided draught,
	Is the readiest man to kill him: 't has been prov'd.
	If I were a huge man, I should fear to drink at meals;
	Lest they should spy my wind-pipe's dangerous notes:
	Great men should drink with harness on their throats.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 1><SCENE 2><15%>
	Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tides well. Those healths will make thee and thy state look ill, Timon.
	Here's that which is too weak to be a sinner,
	Honest water, which ne'er left man i' the mire:
	This and my food are equals, there's no odds:
	Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.
	Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;
	I pray for no man but myself:
	Grant I may never prove so fond,
	To trust man on his oath or bond;
	Or a harlot for her weeping;
	Or a dog that seems a-sleeping;
	Or a keeper with my freedom;
	Or my friends, if I should need 'em.
	Amen. So fall to't:
	Rich men sin, and I eat root.
	Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!
<SPEECH 39><ACT 1><SCENE 2><16%>
	'Would all those flatterers were thine enemies then, that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 1><SCENE 2><17%>
	Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 1><SCENE 2><17%>
	Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 1><SCENE 2><17%>
	Much!
<SPEECH 43><ACT 1><SCENE 2><18%>
	Hoy-day! what a sweep of vanity comes this way:
	They dance! they are mad women.
	Like madness is the glory of this life,
	As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.
	We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves;
	And spend our flatteries to drink those men
	Upon whose age we void it up again,
	With poisonous spite and envy.
	Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?
	Who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves
	Of their friend's gift?
	I should fear those that dance before me now
	Would one day stamp upon me: it has been done;
	Men shut their doors against a setting sun.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 1><SCENE 2><19%>
	Faith, for the worst is filthy; and would not hold taking, I doubt me.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 1><SCENE 2><23%>
	What a coil's here!
	Serving of becks and jutting out of bums!
	I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
	That are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs:
	Methinks, false hearts should never have sound legs.
	Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on curtsies.
<SPEECH 46><ACT 1><SCENE 2><23%>
	No, I'll nothing; for if I should be bribed too, there would be none left to rail upon thee, and then thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou givest so long, Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in paper shortly: what need these feasts, pomps, and vain-glories?
<SPEECH 47><ACT 1><SCENE 2><23%>
	So:
	Thou wilt not hear me now; thou shalt not then;
	I'll lock thy heaven from thee.
	O! that men's ears should be
	To counsel deaf, but not to flattery.
<SPEECH 48><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	Dost dialogue with thy shadow?
<SPEECH 49><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	No; 'tis to thyself. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Come away.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	No, thou stand'st single; thou'rt not on him yet.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	He last asked the question. Poor rogues, and usurers' men! bawds between gold and want!
<SPEECH 52><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	Asses.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	That you ask me what you are, and do not know yourselves. Speak to 'em, fool.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
	Good! gramercy.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	Would I had a rod in my mouth, that I might answer thee profitably.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	Canst not read?
<SPEECH 57><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	There will little learning die then that day thou art hanged. This is to Lord Timon; this to Alcibiades. Go; thou wast born a bastard, and thou'lt die a bawd.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	E'en so thou outrunn'st grace.—
	Fool, I will go with you to Lord Timon's.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	If Timon stay at home. You three serve three usurers?
<SPEECH 60><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
	So would I, as good a trick as ever hangman served thief.
<SPEECH 61><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	Do it, then, that we may account thee a whoremaster and a knave; which, notwithstanding, thou shalt be no less esteemed.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	That answer might have become Apemantus.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
	Come with me, fool, come.
<SPEECH 64><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
	I was directed hither: men report
	Thou dost affect my manners, and dost use them.
<SPEECH 65><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
	This is in thee a nature but infected;
	A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
	From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?
	This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?
	Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft,
	Hug their diseas'd perfumes, and have forgot
	That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods
	By putting on the cunning of a carper.
	Be thou a flatterer now, and seak to thrive
	By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,
	And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe,
	Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,
	And call it excellent. Thou wast told thus;
	Thou gav'st thine ears, like tapsters that bid welcome,
	To knaves and all approachers: 'tis most just
	That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again,
	Rascals should have't. Do not assume my likeness.
<SPEECH 66><ACT 4><SCENE 3><72%>
	Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself;
	A madman so long, now a fool. What! think'st
	That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,
	Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss'd trees,
	That have outliv'd the eagle, page thy heels
	And skip when thou point'st out? will the cold brook,
	Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste
	To cure the o'er-night's surfeit? Call the creatures
	Whose naked natures live in all the spite
	Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks
	To the conflicting elements expos'd,
	Answer mere nature; bid them flatter thee;
	O! thou shalt find—
<SPEECH 67><ACT 4><SCENE 3><73%>
	I love thee better now than e'er I did.
<SPEECH 68><ACT 4><SCENE 3><73%>
	Why?
<SPEECH 69><ACT 4><SCENE 3><73%>
	I flatter not, but say thou art a caitiff.
<SPEECH 70><ACT 4><SCENE 3><73%>
	To vex thee.
<SPEECH 71><ACT 4><SCENE 3><73%>
	Ay.
<SPEECH 72><ACT 4><SCENE 3><73%>
	If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on
	To castigate thy pride, 'twere well; but thou
	Dost it enforcedly; thou'dst courtier be again
	Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery
	Outlives incertain pomp, is crown'd before;
	The one is filling still, never complete;
	The other, at high wish: best state, contentless,
	Hath a distracted and most wretched being,
	Worse than the worst, content.
	Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.
<SPEECH 73><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	Art thou proud yet?
<SPEECH 74><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	I, that I was
	No prodigal.
<SPEECH 75><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	Here; I will mend thy feast.
<SPEECH 76><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	So I shall mend mine own, by the lack of thine.
<SPEECH 77><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	What wouldst thou have to Athens?
<SPEECH 78><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	Here is no use for gold.
<SPEECH 79><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	Where liest o' nights, Timon?
<SPEECH 80><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	Where my stomach finds meat; or, rather, where I eat it.
<SPEECH 81><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	Where wouldst thou send it?
<SPEECH 82><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
	The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the extremity of both ends. When thou wast in thy gilt and thy perfume, they mocked thee for too much curiosity; in thy rags thou knowest none, but art despised for the contrary. There's a medlar for thee; eat it.
<SPEECH 83><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
	Dost hate a medlar?
<SPEECH 84><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
	An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner, thou shouldst have loved thyself better now. What man didst thou ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means?
<SPEECH 85><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
	Myself.
<SPEECH 86><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
	What things in the world canst thou nearest compare to thy flatterers?
<SPEECH 87><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
	Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.
<SPEECH 88><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
	Ay, Timon.
<SPEECH 89><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	If thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thou mightst have hit upon it here; the commonwealth of Athens is become a forest of beasts.
<SPEECH 90><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
	Yonder comes a poet and a painter: the plague of company light upon thee! I will fear to catch it, and give way. When I know not what else to do, I'll see thee again.
<SPEECH 91><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.
<SPEECH 92><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse!
<SPEECH 93><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.
<SPEECH 94><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	I would my tongue could rot them off!
<SPEECH 95><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	Would thou wouldst burst!
<SPEECH 96><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	Beast!
<SPEECH 97><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
	Toad!
<SPEECH 98><ACT 4><SCENE 3><79%>
	Would 'twere so:
	But not till I am dead; I'll say thou'st gold:
	Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly.
<SPEECH 99><ACT 4><SCENE 3><79%>
	Ay.
<SPEECH 100><ACT 4><SCENE 3><79%>
	Live, and love thy misery!
