	You are sent for to the senate:
	A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius,
	Associated with Aufidius, rages
	Upon our territories; and have already
	O'erborne their way, consum'd with fire, and took
	What lay before them.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 5><SCENE 4><94%>
	Good news, good news! the ladies have prevail'd,
	The Volscians are dislodg'd, and Marcius gone.
	A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
	No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.

	As certain as I know the sun is fire:
	Where have you lurk'd that you make doubt of it?
	Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
	As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!
	The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries, and fifes,
	Tabors, and cymbals, and the shouting Romans,
	Make the sun dance. Hark you!

	Sir, we have all
	Great cause to give great thanks.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
	Almost at point to enter.
