	I will go wash;
	And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
	Whether I blush, or no: howbeit, I thank you.
	I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
	To undercrest your good addition
	To the fairness of my power.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><22%>
	The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
	Refus'd most princely gifts, am bound to beg
	Of my lord general.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><22%>
	I sometime lay here in Corioli
	At a poor man's house; he us'd me kindly:
	He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
	But then Aufidius was within my view,
	And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
	To give my poor host freedom.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><23%>
	By Jupiter! forgot.
	I am weary; yea, my memory is tir'd.
	Have we no wine here?
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
	No more of this; it does offend my heart:
	Pray now, no more.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
	O!
	You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
	For my prosperity.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
	My gracious silence, hail!
	Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
	That weep'st to see me triumph? Ah! my dear,
	Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
	And mothers that lack sons.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
	And live you yet? <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> O my sweet lady, pardon.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
	Menenius, ever, ever.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
	</STAGE DIR> Your hand, and yours:
	Ere in our own house I do shade my head,
	The good patricians must be visited;
	From whom I have receiv'd not only greetings,
	But with them change of honours.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
	Know, good mother,
	I had rather be their servant in my way
	Than sway with them in theirs.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
	Your honours' pardon:
	I had rather have my wounds to heal again
	Than hear say how I got them.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
	No, sir: yet oft,
	When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
	You sooth'd not, therefore hurt not. But your people,
	I love them as they weigh.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
	I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
	When the alarum were struck than idly sit
	To hear my nothings monster'd.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
	I do owe them still
	My life and services.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
	I do beseech you,
	Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot
	Put on the gown, stand naked, and entreat them,
	For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you,
	That I may pass this doing.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 2><36%>
	It is a part
	That I shall blush in acting, and might well
	Be taken from the people.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 2><36%>
	To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
	Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
	As if I had receiv'd them for the hire
	Of their breath only!
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	What must I say?
	'I pray, sir,'—Plague upon't! I cannot bring
	My tongue to such a pace. 'Look, sir, my wounds!
	I got them in my country's service, when
	Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
	From the noise of our own drums.'
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	Think upon me! Hang 'em!
	I would they would forget me, like the virtues
	Which our divines lose by 'em.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	Bid them wash their faces,
	And keep their teeth clean.
	So, here comes a brace.
	You know the cause, sir, of my standing here?
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	Mine own desert.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	Ay, not mine own desire.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	No, sir, 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	Well, then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
	Kindly! sir, I pray, let me ha 't: I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private. Your good voice, sir; what say you?
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
	A match, sir. There is in all two worthy voices begged. I have your alms: adieu.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
	Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be consul, I have here the customary gown.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
	Your enigma?
<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
	You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my sworn brother the people, to earn a dearer estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise the insinuating nod, and be off to them most counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man, and give it bountifully to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you, I may be consul.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
	I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
	Most sweet voices!
	Better it is to die, better to starve,
	Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
	Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,
	To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,
	Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to 't:
	What custom wills, in all things should we do 't,
	The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
	And mountainous error be too highly heap'd
	For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,
	Let the high office and the honour go
	To one that would do thus. I am half through;
	The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.
	Here come more voices.
	Your voices: for your voices I have fought;
	Watch'd for your voices; for your voices bear
	Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
	I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
	Done many things, some less, some more; your voices:
	Indeed, I would be consul.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
	Worthy voices!
<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
	Is this done?
<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
	Where? at the senate-house?
<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
	May I change these garments?
<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
	That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
	Repair to the senate-house.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?
<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
	Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road
	Upon 's again.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	Saw you Aufidius?
<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	Spoke he of me?
<SPEECH 42><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	How? what?
<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
	At Antium lives he?
<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
	To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
	Behold! these are the tribunes of the people,
	The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;
	For they do prank them in authority
	Against all noble sufferance.
<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Ha! what is that?
<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	What makes this change?
<SPEECH 47><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Have I had children's voices?
<SPEECH 48><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Are these your herd?
	Must these have voices, that can yield them now,
	And straight disclaim their tongues? What are your offices?
	You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
	Have you not set them on?
<SPEECH 49><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	It is a purpos'd thing, and grows by plot,
	To curb the will of the nobility:
	Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
	Nor ever will be rul'd.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Why, this was known before.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Have you inform'd them sithence?
<SPEECH 52><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	You are like to do such business.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
	Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
	Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
	Your fellow tribune.
<SPEECH 54><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	Tell me of corn!
	This was my speech, and I will speak't again,—
<SPEECH 55><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
	I crave their pardons:
	For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them
	Regard me as I do not flatter, and
	Therein behold themselves: I say again,
	In soothing them we nourish 'gainst our senate
	The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
	Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd and scatter'd,
	By mingling them with us, the honour'd number;
	Who lack'd not virtue, no, nor power, but that
	Which they have given to beggars.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	How! no more!
	As for my country I have shed my blood,
	Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
	Coin words till they decay against those measles,
	Which we disdain should tetter us, yet sought
	The very way to catch them.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	Choler!
	Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
	By Jove, 'twould be my mind!
<SPEECH 58><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Shall remain!
	Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
	His absolute 'shall?'
<SPEECH 59><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	'Shall!'
	O good but most unwise patricians! why,
	You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
	Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
	That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
	The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
	To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
	And make your channel his? If he have power,
	Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
	Your dangerous lenity. If you are learned,
	Be not as common fools; if you are not,
	Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians
	If they be senators; and they are no less,
	When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
	Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
	And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
	His popular 'shall,' against a graver bench
	Than ever frown'd in Greece. By Jove himself!
	It makes the consuls base; and my soul aches
	To know, when two authorities are up;
	Neither supreme, how soon confusion
	May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
	The one by the other.
<SPEECH 60><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
	The corn o' the store-house gratis, as 'twas us'd
	Sometime in Greece,—
<SPEECH 61><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Though there the people had more absolute power,
	I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
	The ruin of the state.
<SPEECH 62><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	I'll give my reasons,
	More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
	Was not our recompense, resting well assur'd
	They ne'er did service for 't. Being press'd to the war,
	Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
	They would not thread the gates: this kind of service
	Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war,
	Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
	Most valour, spoke not for them. The accusation
	Which they have often made against the senate,
	All cause unborn, could never be the motive
	Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
	How shall this bisson multitude digest
	The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
	What's like to be their words: 'We did request it;
	We are the greater poll, and in true fear
	They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
	The nature of our seats, and make the rabble
	Call our cares, fears; which will in time break ope
	The locks o' the senate, and bring in the crows
	To peck the eagles.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	No, take more:
	What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
	Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
	Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
	Insult without all reason; where gentry, title, wisdom,
	Cannot conclude, but by the yea and no
	Of general ignorance,—it must omit
	Real necessities, and give way the while
	To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd, it follows
	Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,—
	You that will be less fearful than discreet,
	That love the fundamental part of state
	More than you doubt the change on 't, that prefer
	A noble life before a long, and wish
	To jump a body with a dangerous physic
	That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out
	The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
	The sweet which is their poison. Your dishonour
	Mangles true judgment, and bereaves the state
	Of that integrity which should become it,
	Not having the power to do the good it would,
	For the ill which doth control 't.
<SPEECH 64><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	Thou wretch! despite o'erwhelm thee!
	What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
	On whom depending, their obedience fails
	To the greater bench. In a rebellion,
	When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
	Then were they chosen: in a better hour,
	Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
	And throw their power i' the dust.
<SPEECH 65><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	Hence, old goat!
<SPEECH 66><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
	Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
	Out of thy garments.
<SPEECH 67><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
	No, I'll die here.
	There's some among you have beheld me fighting:
	Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.
<SPEECH 68><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	Stand fast;
	We have as many friends as enemies.
<SPEECH 69><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>

<SPEECH 70><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	On fair ground
	I could beat forty of them.
<SPEECH 71><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	Let them pull all about mine ears; present me
	Death on the wheel, or at wild horses' heels;
	Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
	That the precipitation might down stretch

	Be thus to them.
<SPEECH 72><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	I muse my mother
	Does not approve me further, who was wont
	To call them woollen vassals, things created
	To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads
	In congregations, to yawn, be still, and wonder,
	When one but of my ordinance stood up
	To speak of peace or war.
	I talk of you:
	Why did you wish me milder? Would you have me
	False to my nature? Rather say I play
	The man I am.
<SPEECH 73><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	Let go.
<SPEECH 74><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>

	Well, what then? what then?

	For them! I cannot do it to the gods;

<SPEECH 78><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>

<SPEECH 79><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
	Why force you this?
<SPEECH 80><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
	Must I with my base tongue give to my noble heart
	A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:
	Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
	This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it,
	And throw 't against the wind. To the market-place!
	You have put me now to such a part which never
	I shall discharge to the life.
<SPEECH 81><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	Well, I must do 't:
	Away, my disposition, and possess me
	Some harlot's spirit! My throat of war be turn'd,
	Which quired with my drum, into a pipe
	Small as a eunuch, or the virgin voice
	That babies lulls asleep! The smiles of knaves
	Tent in my cheeks, and school-boys' tears take up
	The glasses of my sight! A beggar's tongue
	Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
	Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
	That hath receiv'd an alms! I will not do 't,
	Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth,
	And by my body's action teach my mind
	A most inherent baseness.
<SPEECH 82><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	Pray, be content:
	Mother, I am going to the market-place;
	Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
	Cog their hearts from them, and come home belov'd
	Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:
	Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul,
	Or never trust to what my tongue can do
	I' the way of flattery further.
<SPEECH 83><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>

	Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!
<SPEECH 85><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>

	You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate

	And here remain with your uncertainty!
	Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
	Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
	Fan you into despair! Have the power still

	Your ignorance,—which finds not, till it feels,—
	Making but reservation of yourselves,—
	Still your own foes,—deliver you as most
	Abated captives to some nation
	That won you without blows! Despising,

	There is a world elsewhere.
<SPEECH 98><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
	With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
	Where is your ancient courage? you were us'd,
	To say extremity was the trier of spirits;
	That common chances common men could bear;
	That when the sea was calm all boats alike
	Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
	When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves
	A noble cunning: you were us'd to load me
	With precepts that would make invincible
	The heart that conn'd them.
<SPEECH 99><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	Nay, I prithee, woman,—
<SPEECH 100><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	What, what, what!

	Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,
	If you had been the wife of Hercules,
	Six of his labours you'd have done, and sav'd
	Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
	Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife! my mother!
	I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
	Thy tears are salter than a younger man's.
	And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
	I have seen thee stern, and thou hast oft beheld
	Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women
	'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes
	As 'tis to laugh at them. My mother, you wot well
	My hazards still have been your solace; and
	Believe 't not lightly,—though I go alone
	Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
	Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen,—your son
	Will or exceed the common or be caught
	With cautelous baits and practice.

	Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
	My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
	Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.
	While I remain above the ground you shall

<SPEECH 104><ACT 4><SCENE 4><68%>
	A goodly city is this Antium. City,
	'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
	Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
	Have I heard groan and drop: then, know me not,
	Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
	In puny battle slay me.
	Save you, sir.
<SPEECH 105><ACT 4><SCENE 4><68%>
	Direct me, if it be your will,
	Where great Aufidius lies. Is he in Antium?
<SPEECH 106><ACT 4><SCENE 4><68%>
	Which is his house, beseech you?
<SPEECH 107><ACT 4><SCENE 4><68%>
	Thank you, sir. Farewell.
	O world! thy slippery turns. Friends now fast sworn,
	Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,
	Whose hours, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
	Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love
	Unseparable, shall within this hour,
	On a dissension of a doit, break out
	To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
	Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep
	To take the one the other, by some chance,
	Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
	And interjoin their issues. So with me:
	My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon
	This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,
	He does fair justice; if he give me way,
	I'll do his country service.

<SPEECH 121><ACT 4><SCENE 5><70%>
	</STAGE DIR> If, Tullus,
	Not yet thou know'st me, and, seeing me, dost not
	Think me for the man I am, necessity
	Commands me name myself.
<SPEECH 122><ACT 4><SCENE 5><70%>
	A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
	And harsh in sound to thine.
<SPEECH 123><ACT 4><SCENE 5><70%>
	Prepare thy brow to frown. Know'st thou me yet?
<SPEECH 124><ACT 4><SCENE 5><70%>
	My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
	To thee particularly, and to all the Volsces,
	Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
	My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
	The extreme dangers, and the drops of blood
	Shed for my thankless country, are requited
	But with that surname; a good memory,
	And witness of the malice and displeasure
	Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;
	The cruelty and envy of the people,
	Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
	Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
	And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
	Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
	Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope,
	Mistake me not, to save my life; for if
	I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world
	I would have 'voided thee; but in mere spite,
	To be full quit of those my banishers,
	Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
	A heart of wreak in thee, that will revenge
	Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
	Of shame seen through thy country, speed thee straight,
	And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it,
	That my revengeful services may prove
	As benefits to thee, for I will fight
	Against my canker'd country with the spleen
	Of all the under fiends. But if so be
	Thou dar'st not this, and that to prove more fortunes
	Thou art tir'd, then, in a word, I also am
	Longer to live most weary, and present
	My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
	Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
	Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
	Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
	And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
	It be to do thee service.
<SPEECH 125><ACT 4><SCENE 5><72%>
	You bless me, gods!
<SPEECH 126><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
	What's the matter?
<SPEECH 127><ACT 5><SCENE 2><86%>
	Away!
<SPEECH 128><ACT 5><SCENE 2><86%>
	Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
	Are servanted to others: though I owe
	My revenge properly, my remission lies
	In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
	Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather
	Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone:
	Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
	Your gates against my force. Yet, for I lov'd thee,
	Take this along; I writ it for thy sake,
	And would have sent it. Another word, Menenius,
	I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,
	Was my belov'd in Rome: yet thou behold'st!
<SPEECH 129><ACT 5><SCENE 3><87%>
	We will before the walls of Rome to-morrow
	Set down our host. My partner in this action,
	You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly
	I have borne this business.
<SPEECH 130><ACT 5><SCENE 3><87%>
	This last old man,
	Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
	Lov'd me above the measure of a father;
	Nay, godded me indeed. Their latest refuge
	Was to send him; for whose old love I have,
	Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd
	The first conditions, which they did refuse,
	And cannot now accept, to grace him only
	That thought he could do more. A very little
	I have yielded to; fresh embassies and suits,
	Nor from the state, nor private friends, hereafter
	Will I lend ear to. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Ha! what shout is this?
	Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
	In the same time 'tis made? I will not.
	My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould
	Wherein this trunk was fram'd, and in her hand
	The grandchild to her blood. But out, affection!
	All bond and privilege of nature, break!
	Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
	What is that curtsy worth? or those doves' eyes,
	Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
	Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows,
	As if Olympus to a molehill should
	In supplication nod; and my young boy
	Hath an aspect of intercession, which
	Great nature cries, 'Deny not.' Let the Volsces
	Plough Rome, and harrow Italy; I'll never
	Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand
	As if a man were author of himself
	And knew no other kin.
<SPEECH 131><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
	These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
<SPEECH 132><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
	Like a dull actor now,
	I have forgot my part, and I am out,
	Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
	Forgive my tyranny; but do not say
	For that, 'Forgive our Romans.' O! a kiss
	Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
	Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
	I carried from thee, dear, and my true lip
	Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
	And the most noble mother of the world
	Leave unsaluted. Sink, my knee, i' the earth;
	Of thy deep duty more impression show
	Than that of common sons.
<SPEECH 133><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	What is this?
	Your knees to me! to your corrected son!
	Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
	Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
	Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun,
	Murd'ring impossibility, to make
	What cannot be, slight work.

	The god of soldiers,

	I beseech you, peace:
	Or, if you'd ask, remember this before:
	The things I have forsworn to grant may never
	Be held by you denials. Do not bid me

	Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not
	Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not
	To allay my rages and revenges with
	Your colder reasons.
<SPEECH 138><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll

	Not of a woman's tenderness to be,
	Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
	I have sat too long.
<SPEECH 140><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
	O, mother, mother!
	What have you done? Behold! the heavens do ope,
	The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
	They laugh at. O my mother! mother! O!
	You have won a happy victory to Rome;
	But, for your son, believe it, O! believe it,
	Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
	If not most mortal to him. But let it come.
	Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
	I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
	Were you in my stead, would you have heard
	A mother less, or granted less, Aufidius?
<SPEECH 141><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
	I dare be sworn you were:
	And, sir, it is no little thing to make
	Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
	What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,
	I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,
	Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!
<SPEECH 142><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
	Ay, by and by;
	But we will drink together; and you shall bear
	A better witness back than words, which we,
	On like conditions, would have counter-seal'd.
	Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
	To have a temple built you: all the swords
	In Italy, and her confederate arms,
	Could not have made this peace.
<SPEECH 143><ACT 5><SCENE 5><98%>
	Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier;
	No more infected with my country's love
	Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
	Under your great command. You are to know,
	That prosperously I have attempted and
	With bloody passage led your wars even to
	The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
	Do more than counterpoise a full third part
	The charges of the action. We have made peace
	With no less honour to the Antiates
	Than shame to the Romans; and we here deliver,
	Subscrib'd by the consuls and patricians,
	Together with the seal o' the senate, what
	We have compounded on.

	Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart

	Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion—
	Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him, that
	Must bear my beating to his grave—shall join
	To thrust the lie unto him.
<SPEECH 149><ACT 5><SCENE 5><99%>
	Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
	Stain all your edges on me. Boy! False hound!
	If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,
	That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
	Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
	Alone I did it. Boy!
<SPEECH 150><ACT 5><SCENE 5><99%>
	O! that I had him,
	With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,
	To use my lawful sword!
