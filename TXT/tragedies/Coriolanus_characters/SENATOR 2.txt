	Noble Aufidius,
	Take your commission; hie you to your bands;
	Let us alone to guard Corioli:
	If they set down before's, for the remove
	Bring up your army; but, I think you'll find
	They've not prepared for us.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
	Farewell.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
	Get you gone.
