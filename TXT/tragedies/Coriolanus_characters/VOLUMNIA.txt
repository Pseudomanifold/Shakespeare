	I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a more comfortable sort. If my son were my husband, I would freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love. When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering how honour would become such a person, that it was no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 3><10%>
	Then, his good report should have been my son; I therein would have found issue. Hear me profess sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love alike, and none less dear than thine and my good Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><10%>
	Indeed, you shall not.
	Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,
	See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,
	As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:
	Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
	'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,
	Though you were born in Rome.' His bloody brow
	With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
	Like to a harvestman that's task'd to mow
	Or all or lose his hire.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><11%>
	Away, you fool! it more becomes a man
	Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,
	When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
	Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
	At Grecian swords, contemning. Tell Valeria
	We are fit to bid her welcome.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 3><11%>
	He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee,
	And tread upon his neck.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><11%>
	Sweet madam.

	Fie! you confine yourself most unreasonably. Come; you must go visit the good lady that lies in.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
	Why, I pray you?
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
	Let her alone, lady: as she is now she will but disease our better mirth.

	Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for the love of Juno, let's go.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous approbation.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	Nay, 'tis true.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one at home for you.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	O! he is wounded, I thank the gods for't.
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	On 's brows, Menenius; he comes the third time home with the oaken garland.
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	Titus Lartius writes they fought together, but Aufidius got off.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
	Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate has letters from the general, wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war. He hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
	True! pow, wow.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
	I' the shoulder, and i' the left arm: there will be large cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place. He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
	He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five wounds upon him.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
	These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
	Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;
	Which, being advanc'd, declines, and then men die.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
	Nay, my good soldier, up;
	My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and
	By deed-achieving honour newly nam'd,—
	What is it?—Coriolanus must I call thee?
	But O! thy wife!—
<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
	I know not where to turn: O! welcome home;
	And welcome, general; and ye're welcome all.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
	I have liv'd
	To see inherited my very wishes,
	And the buildings of my fancy: only
	There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
	Our Rome will cast upon thee.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	O! sir, sir, sir,
	I would have had you put your power well on
	Before you had worn it out.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	You might have been enough the man you are
	With striving less to be so: lesser had been
	The thwarting of your dispositions if
	You had not show'd them how you were dispos'd,
	Ere they lack'd power to cross you.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	Ay, and burn too.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	Pray be counsell'd.
	I have a heart of mettle apt as yours,
	But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
	To better vantage.
<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	You are too absolute;
	Though therein you can never be too noble,
	But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,
	Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
	I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,
	In peace what each of them by th' other lose,
	That they combine not there.
<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	If it be honour in your wars to seem
	The same you are not,—which, for your best ends,
	You adopt your policy,—how is it less or worse,
	That it shall hold companionship in peace
	With honour, as in war, since that to both
	It stands in like request?
<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
	Because that now it lies you on to speak
	To the people; not by your own instruction,
	Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
	But with such words that are but rooted in
	Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
	Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
	Now, this no more dishonours you at all
	Than to take in a town with gentle words,
	Which else would put you to your fortune and
	The hazard of much blood.
	I would dissemble with my nature where
	My fortunes and my friends at stake requir'd
	I should do so in honour: I am in this,
	Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
	And you will rather show our general louts
	How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
	For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
	Of what that want might ruin.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
	I prithee now, my son,
	Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;
	And thus far having stretch'd it,—here be with them,
	Thy knee bussing the stones,—for in such business
	Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
	More learned than the ears,—waving thy head,
	Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
	Now humble as the ripest mulberry
	That will not hold the handling: or say to them,
	Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
	Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
	Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
	In asking their good loves; but thou wilt frame
	Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
	As thou hast power and person.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	Prithee now,
	Go, and be rul'd; although I know thou hadst rather
	Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
	Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	He must, and will.
	Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
	I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said
	My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
	To have my praise for this, perform a part
	Thou hast not done before.
<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	At thy choice then:
	To beg of thee it is my more dishonour
	Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let
	Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
	Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
	With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list,
	Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
	But owe thy pride thyself.
<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
	Do your will.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
	And occupations perish!
<SPEECH 42><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
	My first son,
	Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
	With thee awhile: determine on some course,
	More than a wild exposture to each chance
	That starts i' the way before thee.
<SPEECH 43><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	O! you're well met. The hoarded plague o' the gods
	Requite your love!
<SPEECH 44><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	If that I could for weeping, you should hear,—
	Nay, and you shall hear some. <STAGE DIR>
	</STAGE DIR> Will you be gone?
<SPEECH 45><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.
	Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship
	To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
	Than thou hast spoken words?
<SPEECH 46><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	More noble blows than ever thou wise words;
	And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:
	Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son
	Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
	His good sword in his hand.
<SPEECH 47><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	Bastards and all.
	Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!
<SPEECH 48><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	'I would he had!' 'Twas you incens'd the rabble:
	Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
	As I can of those mysteries which heaven
	Will not have earth to know.
<SPEECH 49><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
	Now, pray, sir, get you gone:
	You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:
	As far as doth the Capitol exceed
	The meanest house in Rome, so far my son,—
	This lady's husband here, this, do you see,—
	Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Take my prayers with you.
	I would the gods had nothing else to do
	But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em
	But once a day, it would unclog my heart
	Of what lies heavy to 't.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
	Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,
	And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go.
	Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
	In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	O! stand up bless'd;
	Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,
	I kneel before thee, and unproperly
	Show duty, as mistaken all this while
	Between the child and parent.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	Thou art my warrior;
	I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?
<SPEECH 54><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	This is a poor epitome of yours,
	Which by the interpretation of full time
	May show like all yourself.
<SPEECH 55><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	Your knee, sirrah.
<SPEECH 56><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,
	Are suitors to you.
<SPEECH 57><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
	O! no more, no more;
	You have said you will not grant us any thing;
	For we have nothing else to ask but that
	Which you deny already: yet we will ask;
	That, if you fail in our request, the blame
	May hang upon your hardness. Therefore, hear us.
<SPEECH 58><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
	Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
	And state of bodies would bewray what life
	We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
	How more unfortunate than all living women
	Are we come hither: since that thy sight, which should
	Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts,
	Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;
	Making the mother, wife, and child to see
	The son, the husband, and the father tearing
	His country's bowels out. And to poor we
	Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us
	Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
	That all but we enjoy; for how can we,
	Alas! how can we for our country pray,
	Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
	Whereto we are bound? Alack! or we must lose
	The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
	Our comfort in the country. We must find
	An evident calamity, though we had
	Our wish, which side should win; for either thou
	Must, as a foreign recreant, be led
	With manacles through our streets, or else
	Triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
	And bear the palm for having bravely shed
	Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,
	I purpose not to wait on Fortune till
	These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
	Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
	Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner
	March to assault thy country than to tread—
	Trust to't, thou shalt not—on thy mother's womb,
	That brought thee to this world.
<SPEECH 59><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
	Nay, go not from us thus.
	If it were so, that our request did tend
	To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
	The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
	As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit
	Is, that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
	May say, 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,
	'This we receiv'd;' and each in either side
	Give the all-hail to thee, and cry, 'Be bless'd
	For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
	The end of war's uncertain; but this certain,
	That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
	Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name
	Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
	Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
	But with his last attempt he wip'd it out,
	Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
	To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son!
	Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
	To imitate the graces of the gods;
	To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,
	And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
	That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
	Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
	Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
	He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
	Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
	Than can our reasons. There is no man in the world
	More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate
	Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
	Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy;
	When she—poor hen! fond of no second brood—
	Has cluck'd thee to the wars, and safely home,
	Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
	And spurn me back; but if it be not so,
	Thou art not honest, and the gods will plague thee,
	That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
	To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
	Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
	To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
	Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;
	This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
	And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold us.
	This boy, that cannot tell what he would have,
	But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship,
	Does reason our petition with more strength
	Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:
	This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
	His wife is in Corioli, and his child
	Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:
	I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,
	And then I'll speak a little.
