	But we both obey,

	Heavens make our presence, and our practices
	Pleasant and helpful to him!
<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	Mine honoured lord!
<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	Happy in that we are not over happy; On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	Faith, her privates we.

	Which dreams, indeed, are ambition, for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
	We'll wait upon you.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
	What should we say, my lord?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
	My lord, we were sent for.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
	O! there has been much throwing about of brains.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
	There are the players.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
	In what, my dear lord?
<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
	But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
	When we would bring him on to some confession
	Of his true state.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
	But with much forcing of his disposition.
<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
	We will, my lord.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
	Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.

	The king, sir,â€”
<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	No, my lord, rather with choler.
<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start not so wildly from my affair.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
	What, my lord?
<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	O! my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	My lord, I cannot.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	Believe me, I cannot.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	I know no touch of it, my lord.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
	But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony; I have not the skill.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
	We will ourselves provide.
	Most holy and religious fear it is
	To keep those many many bodies safe
	That live and feed upon your majesty.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
	We will haste us.
