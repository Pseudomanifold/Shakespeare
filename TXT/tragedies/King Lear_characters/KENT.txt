	Good my liege,—
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Royal Lear,
	Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
	Lov'd as my father, as my master follow'd,
	As my great patron thought on in my prayers,—
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
	Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
	The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly
	When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?
	Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak
	When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound
	When majesty falls to folly. Reserve thy state;
	And, in thy best consideration, check
	This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,
	Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;
	Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
	Reverbs no hollowness.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	My life I never held but as a pawn
	To wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it,
	Thy safety being the motive.
<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	See better, Lear; and let me still remain
	The true blank of thine eye.
<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	Now, by Apollo, king,
	Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	Do;
	Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
	Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift;
	Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,
	I'll tell thee thou dost evil.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
	Fare thee well, king; sith thus thou wilt appear,
	Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.
	</STAGE DIR> The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,
	That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!
	</STAGE DIR> And your large speeches may your deeds approve,

	If but as well I other accents borrow,

	Shall find thee full of labours.
<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 4><16%>
	A man, sir.

	A knave, a rascal, an eater of broken meats; a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a lily-liver'd, action-taking knave; a whoreson, glass-gazing, superserviceable, finical rogue; one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar, and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I will beat into clamorous whining if thou deniest the least syllable of thy addition.

	What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest me! Is it two days since I tripped up thy heels and beat thee before the king? Draw, you rogue; for, though it be night, yet the moon shines: I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you. <STAGE DIR>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
	No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour. You cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a tailor made thee.
<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
	Ay, a tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or a painter could not have made him so ill, though they had been but two hours o' the trade.
<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
	Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain into mortar, and daub the wall of a jakes with him. Spare my grey beard, you wagtail?
<SPEECH 43><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
	Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.
<SPEECH 44><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
	That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
	Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,
	Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain

	That in the natures of their lords rebel;
	Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;
	Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
	With every gale and vary of their masters,
	Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.
	A plague upon your epileptic visage!
	Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?

<SPEECH 48><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
	Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,
	Under the allowance of your grand aspect,

	On flickering Phœbus' front,—
<SPEECH 49><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
	To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain accent was a plain knave; which for my part I will not be, though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to 't.
<SPEECH 50><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
	None of these rogues and cowards
	But Ajax is their fool.
<SPEECH 51><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
	Sir, I am too old to learn,
	Call not your stocks for me; I serve the king,
	On whose employment I was sent to you;
	You shall do small respect, show too bold malice
	Against the grace and person of my master,
	Stocking his messenger.
<SPEECH 52><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
	Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
	You should not use me so.
<SPEECH 53><ACT 2><SCENE 2><36%>
	Pray, do not, sir. I have watch'd and travell'd hard;
	Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.
	A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:

<SPEECH 54><ACT 2><SCENE 2><36%>
	Good king, that must approve the common saw,
	Thou out of heaven's benediction com'st
	To the warm sun.
	Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,
	That by thy comfortable beams I may
	Peruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles
	But misery: I know 'tis from Cordelia,
	Who hath most fortunately been inform'd
	Of my obscured course; and shall find time
	From this enormous state, seeking to give
	Losses their remedies. All weary and o'erwatch'd,
	Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold
	This shameful lodging.
	Fortune, good night, smile once more; turn thy wheel!

	My lord, when at their home
	I did commend your highness' letters to them,
	Ere I was risen from the place that show'd
	My duty kneeling, there came a reeking post,
	Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
	From Goneril his mistress salutations;
	Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,
	Which presently they read: on whose contents
	They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;
	Commanded me to follow, and attend
	The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:
	And meeting here the other messenger,
	Whose welcome, I perceiv'd, had poison'd mine,—
	Being the very fellow which of late
	Display'd so saucily against your highness,—
	Having more man than wit about me,—drew:
	He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries.
	Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
	The shame which here it suffers.
<SPEECH 63><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	With the earl, sir: here within.
<SPEECH 64><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	None.
	How chance the king comes with so small a number?
<SPEECH 65><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	Why, fool?
<SPEECH 66><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
	Where learn'd you this, fool?
<SPEECH 67><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	Who's here, beside foul weather?
<SPEECH 68><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
	I know you. Where's the king?
<SPEECH 69><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	But who is with him?
<SPEECH 70><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
	Sir, I do know you;
	And dare, upon the warrant of my note,
	Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,
	Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
	With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;
	Who have—as who have not, that their great stars
	Thron'd and set high—servants, who seem no less,
	Which are to France the spies and speculations
	Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,
	Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,
	Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
	Against the old kind king; or something deeper,
	Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;
	But, true it is, from France there comes a power
	Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,
	Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
	In some of our best ports, and are at point
	To show their open banner. Now to you:
	If on my credit you dare build so far
	To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
	Some that will thank you, making just report
	Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
	The king hath cause to plain.
	I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,
	And from some knowledge and assurance offer
	This office to you.
<SPEECH 71><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	No, do not.
	For confirmation that I am much more
	Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take
	What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,—
	As doubt not but you shall,—show her this ring,
	And she will tell you who your fellow is
	That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
	I will go seek the king.
<SPEECH 72><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
	Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet;
	That, when we have found the king,—in which your pain
	That way, I'll this,—he that first lights on him
	Holla the other.
<SPEECH 73><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	Who's there?
<SPEECH 74><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
	Alas! sir, are you here? things that love night
	Love not such nights as these; the wrathful skies
	Gallow the very wanderers of the dark,
	And make them keep their caves. Since I was man
	Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,
	Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never
	Remember to have heard; man's nature cannot carry
	The affliction nor the fear.
<SPEECH 75><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
	Alack! bare-headed!
	Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;
	Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest;
	Repose you there while I to this hard house,—
	More harder than the stone whereof 'tis rais'd,—
	Which even but now, demanding after you,
	Denied me to come in, return and force
	Their scanted courtesy.
<SPEECH 76><ACT 3><SCENE 4><52%>
	Here is the place, my lord; good my lord, enter:

	Well, sir, the poor distress'd Lear's i' the town,

	A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,
