	Ay, madam.
<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
	He's coming, madam; I hear him.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
	Well, madam.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 4><17%>
	So please you,—
<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 4><18%>
	My lady's father.
<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 4><18%>
	I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 4><18%>
	I'll not be struck, my lord.
<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
	Ay, madam.
<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?
<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	Where may we set our horses?
<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.
<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	Why, then I care not for thee.
<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
	Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.
<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
	What dost thou know me for?
<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
	Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!
<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
	Away! I have nothing to do with thee.
<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
	Help, ho! murder! help!
<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
	Help, oh! murder! murder!
<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
	I am scarce in breath, my lord.
<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
	This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spar'd at suit of his grey beard,—
<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
	I never gave him any:
	It pleas'd the king his master very late
	To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;
	When he, conjunct, and flattering his displeasure,
	Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,
	And put upon him such a deal of man,
	That worthied him, got praises of the king
	For him attempting who was self-subdu'd;
	And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
	Drew on me here again.
<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 7><62%>
	My Lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence:
	Some five or six and thirty of his knights,
	Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;
	Who, with some other of the lord's dependants,
	Are gone with him toward Dover, where they boast
	To have well-armed friends.
<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
	Madam, within; but never man so chang'd.
	I told him of the army that was landed;
	He smil'd at it: I told him you were coming;
	His answer was, 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,
	And of the loyal service of his son,
	When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,
	And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:
	What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
	What like, offensive.
<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
	Madam, here comes my lord.
<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
	Ay, madam.
<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
	Madam, with much ado:
	Your sister is the better soldier.
<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
	No, madam.
<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
	I know not, lady.
<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
	I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.
<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
	I may not, madam;
	My lady charg'd my duty in this business.
<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
	Madam, I had rather—
<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
	I, madam!
<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 5><75%>
	Would I could meet him, madam: I would show
	What party I do follow.
<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 6><81%>
	A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!
	That eyeless head of thine was first fram'd flesh
	To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,
	Briefly thyself remember: the sword in out
	That must destroy thee.
<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 6><82%>
	Wherefore, bold peasant,
	Dar'st thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence;
	Lest that infection of his fortune take
	Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.
<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 6><82%>
	Let go, slave, or thou diest.
<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 6><82%>
	Out, dunghill!
<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 6><82%>
	Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.
	If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body;
	And give the letters which thou find'st about me
	To Edmund Earl of Gloucester; seek him out
	Upon the English party: O! untimely death.
