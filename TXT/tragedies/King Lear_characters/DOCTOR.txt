	Madam, sleeps still.

	So please your majesty
	That we may wake the king? he hath slept long.
<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 7><84%>
	Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;
	I doubt not of his temperance.
<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 7><84%>
	Please you, draw near. Louder the music there.

	Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.

	He's scarce awake; let him alone awhile.
<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 7><86%>
	Be comforted, good madam; the great rage,
	You see, is kill'd in him; and yet it is danger
	To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
	Desire him to go in; trouble him no more
	Till further settling.
